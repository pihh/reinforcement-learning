14102,235617,SPGI,What Makes S P Global  SPGI  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at S P Global  NYSE SPGI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  S P Global currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if SPGI is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this independent ratings and analytics provider holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For SPGI  shares are up 2 72  over the past week while the Zacks Business   Information Services industry is up 1 56  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 64  compares favorably with the industry s 4 1  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of S P Global have increased 15 19  over the past quarter  and have gained 57 6  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 11 18  and 28 24   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to SPGI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  SPGI is currently averaging 916 327 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with SPGI 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SPGI s consensus estimate  increasing from  9 39 to  9 40 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that SPGI is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep S P Global on your short list ",2020-01-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-sp-global-spgi-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200501516,200501516

14279,235794,SPGI,Sector ETFs To Watch Out For Until Phase 2 Trade Deal ,opinion,"While the United States and China are set to sign the phase one trade deal  worries over existing tariffs have taken centerstage  The phase one trade deal announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 witnessed a suspension in new tariffs on  160 billion in Chinese made consumer electronics and toysas well as a reduction by half of the existing U S  tariffs  to 7 5  
In return  China has vowed to purchase  200 billion of American goods over the next two years   50 billion worth of energy     35 40 billion in services and  75 billion of manufactured products  mostly    per the South China Morning Post  as quoted on  
However  the United States has kept 25  tariffs on  250 billion of other Chinese goods in place  Also  market watchers are of the view that  if the China fails to meet its huge import targets  read    
Against this backdrop  we highlight a few sector ETFs that should be watched closely 
Consumer 
U S  companies have  in tariffs since the start of the trade war  Per an analysis done by the Tax Foundation  tariffs would lower GDP and wages   cut employment by the equivalent of 79 000 fewer full time jobs in the long run  and  make the U S  tax burden less progressive  as quoted on  
Companies normally try to pass on some cost escalation to their consumers  This in turn pushes up inflation  With a major section of tariffs still in place  iShares U S  Consumer Services ETF  should be tracked closely 
Energy 
Investors need to watch the progression in the sector  While the phase one trade deal may goad China to import more U S  oil  Donald Trump s levy of tariff on steel and aluminum imports is a pain for U S  oil pipeline companies as it pushed up their raw material prices 
U S  energy companies have about 14  exposure to China  Notably  following President Trump s March 22  2018 signing of an executive memorandum to impose regulatory tariffs  company level probability of default  PD  for the U S  energy sector jumped  to 195 bps within just one week  All these data explain how vulnerable the sector is to trade tensions  Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLE   and Alerian MLP ETF   F AMLP   should be watched closely 
Auto
Both steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would considerably push up the sale prices of those vehicles  U S  auto companies earn about 12  revenues from China  China initially increased the tariffs on U S  made automobile imports from  in retaliation to U S  tariffs  though suspended the same later  
Now  with Washington trying to make China buy more cars under the phase one trade deal  First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund    should now get some relief  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  has considerable exposure to China and its performance and developments there should be closely monitored  read    
Homebuilders
In any case  the sector is guilty of higher home prices  With several  still facing 25  tariff increase  cost of homes should likely remain elevated  According to the NAHB  the U S  China trade war has affected  used in the homebuilding industry  However  low levels of U S  mortgage rates have offered buyers the ability to cope with the price rise  SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  thus grabs attention  read    
Industrials   Materials
This area has the most to do with trade tensions as a huge set of industrial products  materials and chemicals are still facing inflated tariffs  This could keep funds like Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund  and Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund  in an edgy position till the U S  presidential election this year 
Tech Hardware   Semicoductors
Tech companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to the trade war  In fact   a list of companies with considerable revenue exposure to China  These companies  revenues are  exposed to China  per a CNBC article  SPDR S P Technology Hardware ETF  should thus be followed carefully 
Along with tech  there are semiconductors  which probably have  the highest revenue exposure to China at    VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  may continue to face troubles if there is a flare up in tensions

115802,337317,SPGI,Crude Falls Again on Supply Demand Imbalance,news,"By Peter Nurse  
Investing com   Oil prices headed lower Friday  as the spread of the pneumonia like virus in China looks set to have a significant impact on growth in the world s largest importer of crude 
By 9 40 AM ET  1440 GMT   U S  crude futures were down 1 9  at  54 52 a barrel  Brent futures were down 1 7  at  60 97 a barrel 
The SARS like virus has claimed the lives of 26 people  and has prompted the Chinese authorities to introduce travel restrictions across 10 cities  affecting up to 40 million people according to some reports  in the middle of their holiday season 
 The virus could shave between 0 5 to 1 percentage point off China s gross domestic product growth this year against a baseline forecast of 5 9 per cent   the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report released late Thursday 
Indeed  the outbreak has already killed demand for 200 000 barrels of refined products  estimated Claudia Galimberti of S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  He said the shutdown of transportation in Hubei province  where the disease was first noted  has probably eliminated about 50 000 to 70 000 barrels a day of demand 
This expected hit to demand has prompted talk of moves by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  to further tighten supply  
Saudi Arabia s energy minister was reported as saying that said all options  including further output cuts  will be on the table at the next meeting of OPEC and its petro allies 
Still  that meeting is scheduled for early March and traders are currently more interested in the current oversupplied nature of the market 
The weekly report published by the Energy Information Administration a day later than usual onThursday revealed that commercial crude oil inventories in the US fell by 0 4 million barrels in the latest week  This compared with hefty draws in the previous two weeks  but still was below estimates for a drop of 1 million barrels

115816,337331,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when S P Global  NYSE SPGI  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent ratings and analytics provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 41 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 70 billion  up 10 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for S P Global 
For S P Global  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that S P Global will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that S P Global would post earnings of  2 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 46  delivering a surprise of  5 58  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
S P Global appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-global-spgi-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200503312,200503312

115818,337333,SPGI,The State Of Oil,opinion,"The oil market welcomed 2020 on a gloomy note  After a failed attempt to hold above  70 per barrel  Brent quotes demonstrated a downward correction  which subsequently developed into a full fledged bearish rally  As a result  in the first month of 2020 alone  Brent lost  10 5  or about 15  of its value  falling to  59 5 per barrel 
At the beginning of January  interest in the oil industry was bolstered by the events in the Middle East and growing political uncertainty  To recap  Qassem Soleimani  an Iranian Major General in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  was killed as a result of the US drone strike near Baghdad airport  Following the airstrike and Soleimani death  Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed harsh revenge  in response to which US President Donald Trump threatened to strike more Iranian targets if Tehran takes retaliatory measures  The likelihood of an open conflict between Tehran and Washington made the investors seriously consider the scenario where the next military campaign in the Middle East would inevitably lead to interruptions in oil supplies from key Islamic producers  which would create a shortage in the global oil market  However  there was no further escalation to this conflict and traders settled down  But not for long  The markets were faced with an even greater threat  which produced a destructive effect on stock markets and investor sentiment 
The global panic around an unidentified virus causing pneumonia outbreak is spreading  The city of Wuhan  the epicenter of China s coronavirus outbreak is still in quarantine   this measure was adopted in an effort to contain the coronavirus epidemic with nearly 5 000 people infected and more than 100 dead  On Monday  Beijing and Hainan reported the first deaths from a viral infection  Coronavirus cases have been also confirmed in Mongolia  South Korea  Thailand  Germany  France and the United States  Active social media users and health experts criticize local authorities for their lack of pandemic preparedness  which  according to scientists  emerged from a wet market at the end of last year 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  forecasted a decrease in daily oil consumption by 260 thousand barrels  including a decrease in demand for jet fuel by 170 thousand barrels per day  based on the SARS impact on oil demand in 2003  A significant China s share of global oil consumption is explained by the fact that China holds the status of a key importer of hydrocarbons  It is worth noting that the virus negatively affects not only the industrial demand for raw materials but also consumer activity  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings warned that if Chinese spending  a key factor in economic growth  drops by 10   overall GDP growth will drop by about 1 2   Thus  the oil market has been hit twice as hard  On the one hand  oil quotes are pressured by the general reluctance of traders to take risks  which leads to the selloff in risky assets  On the other hand  oil decrease is caused by the fears of falling demand from China 
The situation is aggravated by the fact that there is too much oil in the world  The issue of oversupply was raised by Fatih Birol  Executive Director of the International Energy Agency  IEA   at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos  According to him  the global oil surplus will exceed one million barrels per day in H1 2020 
With that said  oil buyers are unlikely to win the fight against weakening demand and oversupply  which means that bears will continue to dominate the market  We recommend using this momentum and expect a decline in Brent oil below   50 per barrel ",2020-01-30,AMarkets Company,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-state-of-oil-200503090,200503090

115847,337362,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends S P Global  NYSE SPGI  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this independent ratings and analytics provider is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for S P Global is 21 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  S P Global has an S TA ratio of 0 66  which means that the company gets  0 66 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 42  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And S P Global is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 6 7  this year versus the industry average of 5 4  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for S P Global  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
S P Global has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

115873,337388,SPGI,S P Platts to assess prices for U S  WTI crude delivered to Asia,news,"By Shu Zhang
SINGAPORE  Reuters    S P Global Platts  N SPGI  said on Monday it will launch new price assessments for U S  crude for Asian buyers from Oct  1  as the United States exports more oil to the East 
Asian refiners are increasingly turning to sweet  or low sulfur  light U S  crude  amid falling production in Asia and as U S  sanctions curb oil supply from Iran and Venezuela 
The two price quotes are for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  Midland for U S  crude sold to Singapore and South Korea s Yeosu on a delivered ex shipment basis  Platts said in a statement 
At both locations  Platts will assess cargoes for delivery three months from the date of publication  it said 
The move follows the first ever offer of a WTI Midland crude cargo by oil major Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  for delivery in October on Platts  widely used trading platform for Asian buyers in late August 
 The market has already shown appetite to demonstrate the value of WTI though the recent publication of the first firm and transparent offer in the Platts Asia Market On Close price assessment process  priced at a premium to Platts Dubai   said Vera Blei  head of oil market pricing at S P Global Platts 
Asia already accounted for 45  of total U S  crude exports at 2 7 million barrels per day  bpd  in the first five months of 2019  she added 
South Korea  which previously tended to import condensate  or an ultra light form of crude oil  from Iran  halted importing Iranian crude from May and saw imports from the United States almost triple in July from the year before 
In July  the United States was South Korea s second biggest crude oil supplier  overtaking Kuwait

115875,337390,SPGI,Congo Republic president s adviser awarded oil licenses at heart of Eni probe,news,"By Joe Bavier  Emilio Parodi and Stephen Jewkes JOHANNESBURG MILAN  Reuters    A Congolese presidential advisor played a key role in awarding oil licenses now at the heart of a corruption probe by Italian authorities that has engulfed energy giant Eni SpA and the family of its chief executive  The advisor  Denis Gokana  headed a committee that awarded licenses to Italy s Eni and a Congolese partner company he founded  according to government records and confirmed by Gokana via email  The Congolese president appointed Gokana in 2013 to head a committee responsible for boosting the role of the country s private sector in the economy  a role that was disclosed at the time in the official government gazette  a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters  This is the first time the role played by a key Congolese official in events at the center of the Italian corruption probe has been publicly revealed  Gokana  who is special natural resources advisor to Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso  denied any wrongdoing  State controlled Eni  one of the world s largest oil companies  disclosed last year that it was under investigation by Milan prosecutors for corruption in Congo Republic   Reuters reported on Sept  28 that Italian prosecutors were investigating the wife of Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi as part of its corruption probe   The inquiry revolves around agreements signed between 2013 and 2015 by Eni s Congolese subsidiary with local partners and seeks to determine whether certain contracts hid a form of bribe  Eni denies any wrongdoing and said it had no say in the awarding of the licenses or the government s choice of its local partner   Africa Oil   Gas Corporation  AOGC   the company founded by Gokana  A lawyer for Descalzi s wife  Marie Magdalena Ingoba  said his client had no comment  The Congo investigation comes as Eni faces allegations alongside Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  that it paid more than  1 billion in bribes to gain control over a Nigerian oil field  Italian authorities have charged Eni  Shell and 13 individuals  including Descalzi  with violating Italy s international corruption law in an ongoing case in Milan  Shell  Eni  Descalzi and the other individuals have denied any wrongdoing in the Nigeria case  The company has said it is confident the allegations leveled at it by prosecutors would be found groundless  In the Congo matter  the fresh detail about the role of the president s advisor raises questions about Eni s due diligence into its local partner  said Natasha White  a London based researcher at anti corruption campaign group Global Witness  The non governmental organization identified the role Gokana played in the reallocation of the licenses and shared the findings with Reuters  A former Eni director told prosecutors that while at the company  he raised concerns to CEO Descalzi about ties between Eni s Congolese partner company and the president s advisor  and that the CEO dismissed them  according to a 2015 deposition reviewed by Reuters  Descalzi  disputed the basis of my remarks and told me my behavior was paralyzing Eni s commercial activities in the petroleum sector   former board member Luigi Zingales  a finance professor  told prosecutors  Descalzi  who has led Eni since 2014  is not a target of the corruption probe related to the company s Congolese operations  according to Eni and a person familiar with the investigation  Eni  Africa s biggest foreign oil and gas producer  declined to comment on Zingales  statements to prosecutors but said it didn t believe he was in a position to properly assess its governance   The company said an audit conducted with the help of external lawyers and consultants found no evidence of corruption in relation to operations in Congo  Eni said its due diligence did identify that its local partner company had been founded by presidential advisor Gokana but concluded that he no longer held an ownership stake or served as a manager  Asked whether the company was aware that Gokana headed the committee that awarded the licenses  Eni said   Eni has no evidence of knowledge of any specific of alleged activity rendered by Mr  Gokana for the benefit of Eni in the award processes   A Congolese government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment addressed to the president and the government  FAMILY TIES Congo Republic  sub Saharan Africa s third largest oil producer by volume  is one of Eni s key African operations  One area of focus for Italian prosecutors is whether Eni gave away a portion of its rights to extract oil in Congo Republic to companies linked to public officials in order to secure the reissue of oil exploration licenses in violation of Italy s international corruption laws  according to search warrants reviewed by Reuters   Eni SpA has  gifted  to companies reporting to Congolese politicians participation shares in oil exploitation licenses   prosecutors asserted in a search warrant issued last year  The warrant identified Gokana as among several public officials with links to AOGC  When the government in 2013 reallocated four oil extraction licenses  which Eni had previously held  the committee chose AOGC to partner with Eni  according to Gokana and Eni  Those four licenses produced oil worth about  400 million in 2014  according to a Reuters calculation based on pricing data from UK energy analysts S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  Eni told Reuters that its share of the four licenses generated  127 million of gross revenues in 2014  which amounted to  72 million of free cash flow  or less than 1  of Eni s overall free cash flow  Gokana  in written responses to Reuters  said that the company he founded was the only local entity with the necessary technical and financial capacity to partner with Eni  He said he had been sole shareholder of AOGC but had divested his entire stake after he was appointed head of Congo s state oil company in January 2005  Italian prosecutors allege he has retained  very strong links  to AOGC  according to a March 2018 search warrant  The four licenses are among a number of permit allocations involving Eni that Italian authorities are investigating  according to the warrant  Gokana confirmed to Reuters that his cousin had been chairman of the local partner  The cousin  Dieudonne Bantsimba  was listed as AOGC s chairman on the company s website as recently as January of this year   Reached by telephone  Bantsimba said he no longer held the role  He declined to say when he stepped down or answer further questions  Eni said that its investigations in Congo  could not  and did not  identify the alleged presence of family ties between Gokana and Bantsimba   It added  that AOGC had certified to Eni the absence of family ties between any company beneficiaries and public officials   AOGC didn t respond to a request for comment   A SORT OF  RETROCESSION   Another part of the Italian prosecutors  corruption probe focuses on what they describe in search warrants as  a sort of  retrocession    or a form of kickback  involving six individuals  including the wife of Eni CEO Descalzi  Specifically  prosecutors are investigating whether the individuals benefited from a deal in which AOGC obtained a stake in a potentially promising offshore oil exploration zone and then transferred it to a British registered oil exploration company named World Natural Resources Ltd  In a Sept  26 prosecution document related to Ingoba  prosecutors allege WNR s then director Alexander Haly was a business partner of Descalzi s wife  Haly is chief executive of Monaco based supply ship operator Petro Services  part of Amsterdam based Petroserve Holding BV  according to the company s web site  Petro Services  Congo subsidiary won more than  100 million worth of contracts with Eni from 2012 to 2017  according to a 2018 search warrant  Prosecutors  in the September document  allege Petro Services was controlled by Descalzi s wife via a series of shell companies located in Holland  Luxembourg and Cyprus  In its response to Reuters  Eni said contracts won by Petro Services  took place within a competitive framework  and  no Eni director or employee has ever told the company about having an interest in World Natural Resources   A spokeswoman for Haly and Petro Services declined to comment  According to British company registration filings  Haly resigned as a WNR director in 2014  WNR didn t respond to a request for comment   SIMPLY DISCLOSED  Italian authorities are also investigating the CEO and his wife in relation to a separate probe into alleged failure to disclose a conflict of interest connected to Eni s dealings in Congo    No charges have been made in either the corruption or the disclosure probe related to Eni s Congolese operations  Descalzi  whose term as CEO is up for renewal by shareholders next spring  denied wrongdoing in a written response to Reuters   Had I known about any such potential situation  I would have simply disclosed   he said  
Descalzi also referred Reuters to a statement issued by Eni last month in which he said in part   I am totally certain that I have always behaved lawfully    Additional reporting from Alexis Akwagyiram in Lagos and Noah Browning in London  Editing by Cassell Bryan Low ",2019-10-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/congo-republic-presidents-adviser-awarded-oil-licenses-at-heart-of-eni-probe-1994431,1994431
115876,337391,SPGI,BOJ sends clearer signal of rate cut chance  keeps policy steady,news,By Leika Kihara and Daniel Leussink TOKYO  Reuters    The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday as expected but gave the strongest signal to date that it may cut interest rates in the near future  underscoring its concern that overseas risks could derail a fragile economic recovery  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank still had room to take already negative rates even lower to prevent global uncertainties from hurting the world s third largest economy   The chance of the economy losing momentum to hit our price  inflation  target hasn t escalated  But we need to scrutinize developments as overseas uncertainties are heightening   Kuroda said   It s still possible for the BOJ to deepen negative rates   he told a news conference after a policy view  adding the costs of doing so would not deter him from taking short term rates beyond the current  0 1   The decision came hours after the U S  Federal Reserve lowered rates again but signaled a pause in further cuts unless the economy took a turn for the worse  The BOJ  which has far less policy ammunition left than the Fed  maintained its short term rate target at  0 1  and that for the 10 year bond yield at around 0   It also maintained a pledge to buy government bonds so its holdings increase at an annual pace of roughly 80 trillion yen   736 billion   But the BOJ modified its forward guidance   a signal central banks give to markets on future policy moves   to indicate more clearly its readiness to cut rates if needed   The BOJ expects short  and long term interest rates to remain at present or lower levels as long as needed to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving its price target will be lost   the central bank said in a statement announcing its policy decision  That compared with the previous language that committed to keep  current ultra low rates for an extended period of time  at least until the spring of 2020   Kuroda said the new guidance was aimed at clarifying to markets the BOJ s readiness to ramp up stimulus   The BOJ wanted to maintain expectations among the market that further easing is still a possibility   said Masaaki Kanno  chief economist at Sony Financial Holdings  SIDE EFFECTS LOOM The BOJ last month said it would use its October rate review to look more thoroughly at overseas risks  stoking market speculation of immediate action  Conditions have improved since then  The yen has shown some signs of steadying recently  taking pressure off the BOJ to prevent an unwelcome yen spike from hurting exports  While inflation is still well below the BOJ s 2  target  data this week showed industrial output rebounded in September and retail sales jumped the most in over 5 years   Overseas economic risks are heightening  But the negative impact hasn t spread much to the domestic demand   Kuroda said  But the outlook remains murky  Exports continue to contract and a sales tax hike this month has raised concerns the economy could tip into recession  In fresh quarterly projections  the BOJ cut its inflation forecasts as falling fuel costs and soft household spending weigh on price growth  Kuroda said the new forward guidance did not mean the BOJ was ruling out means besides rate cuts  such as ramping up asset buying or printing money more aggressively  But he said the best way to stimulate the economy was to lower short  to medium term borrowing costs  signaling that deepening negative rates was the most likely next option  Excessive declines in super long yields  on the other hand  were undesirable as they could dampen household mood by eroding returns of pensions funds and insurance firms  Kuroda said   If the yield curve flattens too much  we can tweak our market operations  such as further slowing the BOJ s purchases of super long bonds  he said  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings warned on Tuesday that Japanese regional banks will see core operating profits fall by 21  if the BOJ deepens negative rates   The BOJ doesn t have many tools left to ease policy so it probably wanted to save them for now  particularly with fading expectations of a Fed rate cut seen keeping yen rises at bay   said Izuru Kato  chief economist at Totan Research   If risks do not heighten enough to prod the Fed to ease in December  the BOJ could hold off on action that month as well   The BOJ s next rate review is Dec  18 19 ,2019-10-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/boj-may-hold-fire-as-softer-yen-trade-truce-offer-respite-2008109,2008109
115877,337392,SPGI,At Smithfield Foods  slaughterhouse  China brings home U S  bacon,news,"By Tom Polansek SMITHFIELD  Virginia  Reuters    Smithfield Foods  slaughterhouse in Virginia used to carve up pork for American sandwiches and holiday dinners  But workers now box up pig carcasses to ship to China  according to employees  local officials and industry sources   The transformation at the Smithfield  Virginia  plant shows how the global meat industry is adapting to profit from African swine fever  a fatal pig disease that has killed millions of hogs in China and turned the world s top pork consumer into a major meat importer  Bought by China s WH Group Ltd  HK 0288  six years ago for  4 7 billion  Smithfield Foods has retooled U S  processing operations to direct meat to China  which produced half the world s pork before swine fever decimated the industry  The world s biggest pork processor operates a white  box shaped meat plant in Smithfield  Virginia  home to 8 000 as well as the company s headquarters and a wider tourist economy built on its famous hams  bacon and sausages  Since late spring  pigs trucked to the plant have been slaughtered and sliced into thirds for shipment to China  where Chinese workers process the carcasses further  company employees and industry sources told Reuters    They got an order to fill  China   said one plant worker  who asked to remain anonymous  Smithfield Foods declined to comment on the change or allow a reporter to visit the Virginia plant  which slaughters about 10 000 pigs a day   The company previously said it was upgrading the facility  without giving details  and that U S  business was a priority  Other Smithfield Foods plants in the United States have continued to slaughter pigs for the home market  industry sources said  WH Group  known as Shuanghui International Holdings when it bought Smithfield Foods  did not respond to a request for comment  However  Arnold Silver  Smithfield s director of raw materials procurement  said at a recent industry conference that sales to China could eventually create bacon and ham shortages for American consumers       The outbreak of African swine fever has killed up to half of China s hog herd since August 2018 and pushed prices so high that Chinese importers are willing to pay hefty tariffs that Beijing imposed on U S  pork as part of the countries  bruising trade war  U S  pork producers say China s losses from the disease have created a once in a lifetime opportunity for sales  After shifting operations  Smithfield Foods can process pigs more quickly in Virginia because employees are doing less work on each carcass  according to the plant worker  The job is still difficult  though   They freeze it up  It s heavy   said the employee  who was wearing a brace to support his back and a sweatshirt to keep warm   PIGS WILL FLY The United States exported 294 5 million kilograms of pork to China between January and August  according to U S  Census Bureau data  more than in the whole of 2018  Frozen carcasses accounted for about 20  of exports by weight from January to August  up from 0 3  during the same period in 2017  the data show  Smithfield Foods was the top shipper this summer  sending at least 17 6 million kilograms of pork to China between June and September  according to Panjiva  a division of S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Market Intelligence  Kansas based  Seaboard Corp   A SEB  sold at least 5 3 million  Panjiva said  The firm noted its data does not capture all shipments  Seaboard did not respond to a request for comment   Down the road  if this continues and we ship a lot of product to China  certainly I think we could see shortages  particularly on hams and bellies   Smithfield s Silver told the conference  Smithfield Foods renovated its Virginia plant to supply carcasses to China  according to a person with direct knowledge of operations who asked not to speak publicly about the changes   There were departments that were completely eliminated or erased or remodeled   the person said   Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  and JBS USA  JBS UL  are also maneuvering to increase sales by stopping the use of the growth drug ractopamine  which is banned by China   THE WHOLE HOG China is importing U S  hog carcasses because it needs the entire animal  rather than specific parts  market analysts said  China has excess capacity in its processing industry due to the disease outbreak and can cut up U S  carcasses to meet domestic tastes more cheaply than buying already butchered pork  they said  China s tariffs on frozen carcasses are also 62   compared with 72  for muscle cuts  said Erin Borror  economist for the U S  Meat Export Federation  an industry group   They need to be able to run their plants and keep workers employed to the extent possible   she said   Smithfield Foods said it is subject to the same Chinese trade tariffs as other U S  pork producers  despite being owned by a China based company  The United States did not export any hog carcasses to China between January and May of this year but shipped 6 million kilograms in June  28 million kilograms in July and 26 million kilograms in August  U S  Census Bureau data show   The start of shipments coincides with the conversion of Smithfield Foods  Virginia operations  traders said  Increased exports of hog carcasses are so new that the U S  Department of Agriculture said it plans to clarify its reporting requirements for shippers to make sure sales are being counted accurately  Some meat traders said weekly recorded sales have looked low  Bob Brown  a longtime U S  livestock market analyst  said tracking carcass sales to China should not be difficult because most are being done by Smithfield Foods from its Virginia facility   This is one plant  one company  one place   Brown said  NERVOUS WORKERS Smithfield Foods  latest turn toward China is an unusual shift for America s so called ham capital  which boasts a museum featuring the world s oldest ham and streets dotted with brightly colored pig sculptures   Mayor T  Carter Williams  NYSE WMB  said he heard from company workers that the plant is shipping more pork to China   It doesn t bother us at all   Williams said   The meat s in the store  All the local supply is still here   Smithfield Foods workers are worried  though  Many were shuffled to different jobs in the slaughterhouse due to the overhaul  according to employees   They say they re doing everything short now and cutting out a lot of jobs   said James Moton  who cuts hair at Hamtown Barber   Styling in downtown Smithfield  
A former sanitation worker at the slaughterhouse  Moton learned of the operations changes from customers who still work at the facility   They re hoping they still have a job  ",2019-11-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/at-smithfield-foods-slaughterhouse-china-brings-home-us-bacon-2012007,2012007

115879,337394,SPGI,Attack on Canadian mining firm in Burkina Faso threatens gold s final frontier,news,"By David Lewis  Helen Reid and Zandi Shabalala NAIROBI JOHANNESBURG LONDON  Reuters    As jihadists wreaked ever more havoc in the last two years  mining firms in Burkina Faso rolled out extra security measures  from barracks for government troops protecting them to safe rooms for workers behind barbed wire and mounds   Expatriates generally fly in and out  while local staff still drive but in guarded convoys  That has added millions of dollars to security costs for foreign companies  mainly from Canada and Australia  operating in the West African nation where industrial miners are forecast to produce 60 tonnes of gold this year   Yet this week s attack on a convoy ferrying hundreds of local employees and contractors from a mine owned by Canada s Semafo  TO SMF  has exposed just how vulnerable firms still are   At least 37 civilians died  with another 60 injured and dozens more feared missing  Abandoned buses and pickups lay riddled with bullets  Bloodied bodies were slumped in the vehicles and on a red dirt road  Military reinforcements arrived but only after the lead escort vehicle was blown up  officials said   This is the deadliest incident targeting the mining industry  or any private businesses  in the Sahel since the 2013 In Amenas hostage crisis   said Vincent Rouget  an analyst at Control Risks Group  referring to an attack on a gas plant in the Algerian desert that killed dozens of foreign hostages  There has been no claim for Wednesday s ambush  but the modus operandi   a bomb attack on military escorts followed by gunmen unleashing bullets   suggested the involvement of Islamist groups  They have been pushing south from strongholds in northern Mali to carry out attacks across much of Burkina Faso and parts of western Niger  Over 1 000 people have been killed in Burkina Faso since 2016 and nearly 500 000 more have fled their homes  mainly this year  In this time  there have been dozens of attacks on industrial and small scale mining operations  It is an acute dilemma for miners  The region is seen as the gold industry s final frontier  with large untapped reserves  Lured by relatively low cost mining  firms have invested billions over the last decade   but expansion by al Qaeda and Islamic State linked militants could force them to rethink  WORTH THE RISK   Because of the escalating security situation in Burkina  there are companies looking at decreasing their exposure to the country or leaving   said Bill Witham  the head of AAMEG  a body representing Australian resource companies in Africa   But the miners still see West Africa as a whole as quite a good investment   Semafo s Toronto listed shares dropped 10 percent after the attack  And major mines just over the borders in northern Ghana and Ivory Coast are now within striking distance of Islamist strongholds  experts warn  Last year  AQIM  the main al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa  told followers Western companies  especially from France  were  legitimate targets   Semafo  whose staff  contractors or escorts have been attacked three time in the last 18 months  declined to comment further  saying only that it had beefed up security since those episodes   Eight other companies contacted by Reuters around the Sahel would not give details of their extra security costs  West Africa has long been considered a risky prospect where political instability  volatile tax regimes and tricky relations with small scale miners weigh heavily on boardrooms  Yet government incentives and the potential to produce gold relatively cheaply led to over  7 billion invested in mining projects in the region between 2004 and 2018  according to a tally by S P Global  NYSE SPGI   a market intelligence company   This peaked at  1 2 billion in 2012 alone  when gold prices were at an all time high  That year  al Qaeda linked groups took over northern Mali but gold operations were unscathed as most mines are in the south  hundreds of kilometers away from militant strongholds  Since then  France has deployed over 4 000 troops to the region  there is a 16 000 strong United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali  and West African leaders have launched regional security initiatives  However  local armies are losing ground  Since 2017  researchers documented at least 28 violent incidents at mines or involving mining workers in Burkina Faso  17 of them this year  according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location   Event Data Project   At least 12 of those events this year  which include attacks on workers  abductions and the use of improvised explosive devices  were linked to jihadists  Prior to Wednesday  at least 54 people had been killed in mining related violence this year  five times as many as all of 2018   BRACING FOR AN ATTACK  This has forced the industry to accept that the threat has spread well beyond Niger s northern deserts  where the likes of Frances s Areva have uranium mining operations and expatriates have been kidnapped  said Rouget  In October 2018  France scrambled two jets to strike militants attacking a gold mine in northern Burkina Faso  Earlier this year  Burkina Faso s government asked mining firms to help fund a rapid reaction unit with helicopters to respond to incidents like Wednesday s  but the initiative did not materialize  according to two people involved in meetings  One company security official said his firm spent millions of dollars on armored vehicles  bullet proof walls and safety rooms   We are bracing for an In Amenas style attack   he said  However  some analysts believe mines still have sufficient defenses   The only thing that would shift the perception among gold miners that exposure to this insecurity is a risk worth taking is a direct attack on a mine site   an unlikely prospect   said Eric Humphery Smith at risk consultancy Verisk  NASDAQ VRSK  Maplecroft  The top investor in Semafo said risk and gold mining went hand in hand  and extra security costs would not be a game changer   Obviously it will add maybe a few dollars to the cost of producing an ounce of gold  but it is not going to change the overall economics   said Joe Foster  gold fund portfolio manager at VanEck Investment Management  which has a 10 1  stake in Semafo  One immediate impact could be restrictions on how far afield firms are prepared to send geologists  In May  Oumarou Idani  Burkina Faso s minister of mines  identified exploration companies as high risk   They work over large areas  sometimes 250 square kilometers     it is difficult to have a secure way of working over that size of area    Months earlier  Kirk Woodman  a Canadian geologist with 20 years  experience in the region  was kidnapped and found dead  That was a  a big wakeup call   a former senior mining executive who is now an investor told Reuters   Miners are going to risk exploring further afield a lot less now   he said  asking not to be named   This will affect how many new gold deposits are found

115881,337396,SPGI,Gazing into the recession crystal ball,news,By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Megan Davies NEW YORK  Reuters    The protracted trade war between China and the United States and a deteriorating global growth outlook have left investors nervous that the longest expansion in American history is at risk of ending  Recession fears were sparked earlier this year when the yield curve inverted   a key indicator of a pending downturn  An inverted yield curve occurs when yields on short term bonds are higher than those on long term bonds  a sign investors are so worried about the future that they are willing to hold long term bonds  which are usually viewed as a safer alternative to stocks and other investments  even when the payouts are low  While concerns have eased  an economic rebound is not expected any time soon  according to a recent Reuters poll of economists  and pockets of the economy and markets which are causing concern  Slowdowns were seen in manufacturing and private payrolls data out this week  A recent report from S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings pegs the chance of a U S  recession over the next 12 months from 25  30   versus 30 35  in August  S P Global s recession probability model   Here are some indicators that investors watch for signs of economic health   1  THE YIELD CURVE When the spread between the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill and that of the 10 year Treasury note slips below zero  as it did earlier this year  it points to investors accepting a lower yield for locking money up for a longer period of time   That gauge has a solid track record as a predictor of recessions  But it can take as long as two years for a recession to follow a yield curve inversion  While the inverted yield curve reverted to normal in October  that does not mean that the economy is out of the woods  On the contrary  such a return to normalcy after an inversions is an oft repeated pattern before a recession  Yield curve as a predictor of recessions   2  THE SAHM RULE The newly minted Sahm Rule identifies signals related to the start of a recession when the three month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0 50 percentage point or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months  Devised by Federal Reserve economist and consumer section chief Claudia Sahm  the rule aims to flag the onset of recession more quickly than the current process that formally dates business cycles  It is currently well below the level of concern  at just  0 03 percentage point   The  Sahm Rule   3  UNEMPLOYMENT  The U S  unemployment rate and initial jobless claims ticked higher just ahead of or in the early days of the last two recessions before rising sharply  Currently  the U S  unemployment rate is near a 50 year low  Investors will be watching claims over the coming months for signs that simmering trade tensions  which have dimmed the economy s outlook  are spilling over to the labor market   Unemployment rate   4  GDP OUTPUT GAP The output gap is the difference between actual and potential economic output and is used to gauge the health of the economy   A positive output gap  like the one that exists now  indicates the economy is operating above its potential  Typically the economy operates furthest below its potential at the end of recessions and peaks above its potential toward the end of

115926,337441,SPGI,Leveraged loan investors push private equity firms on ESG,news,"By Prudence Ho
LONDON  LPC    Private equity firms are under pressure to boost their use of environmental  social and governance  ESG  criteria as debt investors and limited partners in their funds increasingly use sustainability criteria to drive investment decisions and manage risk 
The use of ESG standards in Europe s leveraged loan market is still in its infancy  Spanish telecom operator Masmovil completed Europe s first ESG linked leveraged loan in May  while nearly  30 billion of investment grade ESG linked corporate loans have already been completed in 2019  according to LPC data 
Debt investors are increasingly citing ESG criteria as reasons to join deals or not  and private equity firms  limited partners also have sustainability targets  but private equity firms are skirting the issue as they try to deploy record amounts of cash 
 We know ESG is very important to many of the limited partners in private equity funds  but it hasn t yet settled down into a direct consistent impact on either asset selection or pricing   said David Gillmor  sector lead  European leverage finance at S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings 
Private equity sponsors raised only  2 5 billion of funds with ESG mandates in 2018  which at 0 5  is a fraction of total global fund raising  according to data provider Preqin 
Private equity firms are using their own ESG definitions to avoid any restrictions and maintain flexibility as they struggle to spend a record  1 54 trillion of dry powder  or uninvested capital  after raising multibillion dollar funds 
 If it  ESG  is strictly applied  that could narrow down the choices of M A targets  Even investing in a plastic packaging firm could be a problem   a fund manager said 
NOT READY YET
Europe s leveraged loan market is struggling to incorporate ESG criteria into deal structures  Its use has been limited to capital expenditure and revolving tranches to date  which are mostly sold to banks  while institutional term loans have remained unchanged 
Masomovil s loan totaled  1 7 billion  but only the  250 million capex and revolver tranches were ESG linked  which will give a 15 basis point margin reduction if the company s sustainability rating improves 
Some investors oppose ESG margin ratchets  which could reduce their income and increase the sell down risk in general syndication for underwriting banks 
 You are not doing ESG to get a lesser return  It s not a trade off between the two   said Stephane Michel  senior portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management   I want to keep the upside because I have selected a better credit by filtering out poor ESG performers  
The use of ESG ratings across private equity firms  portfolio companies is currently limited  S P has no ESG evaluations for leveraged loan borrowers  and many middle market or SME companies currently have no ESG scores 
Even if ESG ratings or scores were available for leveraged companies  not all fund managers think that they should necessarily be linked to pricing 
 It s not a 100  correlation to improving credit  You could have a super ESG rating  but it s not the sole determinant of spread performance   Michel said 
GUIDING DECISION
Although private equity firms are dragging their heels on ESG  portfolio managers are increasingly facing questions from leveraged loan investors about underlying investments  portfolio breakdowns  ratings exposure and other related issues 
 Every fund raising meeting  investors asked about it  and you have to reflect that in your investment decisions   a second fund manager said 
A  500 million equivalent leveraged loan for Israeli cyber surveillance firm NSO Group was one of the first deals to highlight negative ESG issues  The deal was placed at 90 percent of face value after it was revealed that the company s spyware tool Pegasus was used to target human rights activists 
At least four European CLO funds have been issued with an ESG focus since March 2018  The funds adopt negative screening to avoid investing in sectors including tobacco  gambling  pornography  weapons and hazardous chemicals 
European banks including  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP   ING and HSBC are at the forefront of sustainability financing  BNP Paribas has a team working on ESG structures for different financing products and ING aims to double its funding by 2022 to companies and sectors that are helping to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius 
 We believe sustainable business is better business   said Leonie Schreve  global head of sustainable finance at ING  The bank has established a global team to grow the sustainable finance business  covering green bonds  ESG linked loans  green loans and green equity 
Although it is still at an early stage  the inclusion of ESG criteria in leveraged loans is expected to develop quickly 

 It s almost exponential the acceleration  it  ESG  is here to stay and it will force private equity to pay attention   a senior banker said ",2019-06-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/leveraged-loan-investors-push-private-equity-firms-on-esg-1905434,1905434
115927,337442,SPGI,Fosun Ramps Up Deals Chase as Other Chinese Giants Retreat,news," Bloomberg     Sign up for Next China  a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it s going next 
About three years after China started reining in an overseas acquisition spree by some of its home grown companies  the binge all but ended  But not for Fosun Group 
The 27 year old conglomerate  spanning insurance to mining and health care  has kept a low profile with relatively smaller purchases averaging less than  200 million since the start of 2018  The latest flurry of talks signals the empire  led by billionaire founder Guo Guangchang  is preparing to ramp up the size of the deals 
A consortium led by Fosun International Ltd  is in talks to buy a majority stake in a Russian gold miner  a transaction that could value the target at  1 billion  people familiar with the matter said this week  The company is also considering a joint bid for Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG s animal health business  which could be valued at as much as  9 billion  Thomas Cook Group Plc has said it received an offer from Fosun for its tour operator business 
Fosun is the last of the serial Chinese buyers still out chasing deals while others such as HNA Group Co     once the most acquisitive local conglomerate    are pulling back  after a string of splashy acquisitions from Waldorf Astoria hotel to European soccer clubs invited Beijing s scrutiny  Being a relatively smaller group  Fosun dodged the brunt of an ensuing crackdown  and shifted its focus to deals that fit better into its core businesses 
 With the withdrawal of other large conglomerates  clearly they see an opportunity   said Andrew Collier  a Hong Kong based managing director at Orient Capital Research Inc   They also may have got approval from within the country as long as they are in sectors of use to the country  which would include commodities and health care  
Fosun is a part of a group of four private Chinese giants    others being being HNA  Dalian Wanda Group Co  and Anbang Insurance Group Co     that were targeted in China s deleveraging campaign  Authorities grew wary of capital outflows and debt used to fund the transactions  following a historic credit expansion in the aftermath of the global financial crisis 
HNA  which started as a little known airline operator  shot into prominence this decade by spending more than  40 billion on acquisitions across six continents starting 2016 in a breathtaking spree  including stakes in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc  to  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn   Dalian Wanda Group  led by billionaire chairman Wang Jianlin  acquired assets in Hollywood such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc  and Legendary Entertainment LLC  Anbang made global headlines in 2014 with the trophy purchase of New York s Waldorf Astoria hotel 
18 Year Prison
Within a few years  many of those deals unraveled  HNA founder and Chairman Chen Feng told Caijing in November that his group had sold about  45 billion of assets in 2018  Wanda has disposed of property in Beverly Hills and European soccer clubs  Anbang was temporarily seized by China s insurance regulator last year and its former chairman Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud 
Representatives for Fosun  Wanda and Anbang didn t respond to requests for comments  while HNA declined to comment 
Fosun International itself bought about  22 billion of assets overseas since the start of 2012  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Allaying concerns the group runs the risk of snapping up anything going cheap instead of adding quality holdings  executives said in 2016 that Fosun is different because it gets more involved in making strategic decisions in the companies it invests in 
For instance  after acquiring control of Club Med SAS in 2015 following a protracted takeover battle  Fosun revived the fortunes of the once flagging resorts brand by bringing Chinese customers  Now Club Med is the crown jewel of its tourism and leisure business  It also owns a stake in Canadian performance art group Cirque du Soleil and 18  of Thomas Cook 
Turbulent Times
After the spree  Fosun went through some turbulent times as well  A brief disappearance of Chairman Guo in December 2015 caused shares of the group companies to tank  triggering a halt to trading after they lost as much as  3 billion in market value  The news came at a time of heightened scrutiny as part of President Xi Jinping s biggest crackdown on graft since the republic s founding in 1949 
Following the turmoil  Fosun set out to become leaner in 2016  with some asset disposals of its own  Among the sales by Fosun included Ironshore Inc  in December 2016  The Chinese company had bought the Bermuda based property and casualty insurer only the previous year  Some of the assets Fosun still owns are the Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club in the U K  and Studio 8  a filmmaker 
Having more than halved its net debt in the last two years to 21 9 billion yuan   3 2 billion  as of end 2018  Fosun has been lately focusing mostly on hospitality  health care and finance  businesses Guo says are linked to happiness  health and wealth 
The group is targeting to grow into an empire with a market value of  100 billion  compared with about  22 billion now for its three Hong Kong listed units  That makes the latest round of planned acquisitions crucial  The last time Fosun announced a billion dollar takeover was almost three years ago  when it agreed to buy Gland Pharma Ltd  in India  data compiled by Bloomberg show 
 Chinese buyers are becoming more rational in making their acquisition decisions   said Leon Qi  regional head of Asian Financials Research at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd   They pay more attention to business synergies and returns of these assets  while for a few years they had been chasing some big names for reputation  
Credit Rating
Still  the ride may not be smooth  Uncertainties in the European Union including Brexit and China s regulations on capital outflows could hamper Fosun s plans  It also needs to boost its credit rating  Despite the reduction in Fosun s debt  its U S  dollar bonds are rated two notches below investment grade by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings  potentially making it more expensive to fund these acquisitions 
 I don t think they are out of China s scrutiny  no one really is   said Jin Rui Oh  a Singapore based analyst at United First Partners   But these are not multibillion deals financed out of heavy borrowings  and also non U S  based  
In a shift of strategy amid the trade war  Fosun is easing up on investments in the U S  and pivoting toward emerging markets and Europe  Last year  it acquired a majority stake in French fashion house Lanvin and paid about  44 million for a controlling stake in Guide Investimentos  a Brazilian brokerage 
Fosun International s major advantage is its revenue mix  said Daiwa s Qi  Almost half of the company s sales come from overseas  providing it the buffer needed for the acquisitions 
 There s minimal funding mismatch  and that reduces the chances of cross border fund flow   an issue authorities were concerned about  Qi said

115928,337443,SPGI,S P Global rates China domestic issuer in first by foreign agency,news,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI  Reuters    The Beijing based unit of S P Global on Thursday became the first international credit rating agency to rate a domestic issuer in China  a long awaited step in the development of the country s  13 trillion bond market 
Chinese bond investors hope that ratings by international agencies will help to shake up domestic counterparts which assign relatively safe AA ratings to the vast majority of issuers  and have come under regulatory fire for operational violations 
S P Global  China  Ratings said it assigned a AAA issuer credit rating to ICBC Financial Leasing Co  with a stable outlook  The AAA rating  S P s highest  reflects an issuer s  extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments   the agency says 
S P said a mismatch in the durations of ICBC Financial Leasing s assets and debt presented some liquidity risk  but diverse funding sources and liquidity support from parent Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  ICBC   SS 601398  made the risks  manageable  
ICBC Financial Leasing  ICBCFL  describes itself as a leading leasing firm in China  involved in leasing aircraft  ships and industrial equipment  Its four outstanding bonds in China s interbank market are worth a total of 10 billion yuan   1 46 billion   according to Refinitiv data 
The company also has a AAA long term issuer credit rating from domestic agency China Lianhe Credit Rating Co 
S P  along with Moody s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings  previously assigned ratings for ICBCFL s overseas debt issues 
Thursday s rating follows S P s approval by the People s Bank of China in January to enter the domestic credit rating market  the first time a foreign rating agency received a license to rate domestic bonds  S P Global  China  Ratings is wholly owned by S P Global Inc  N SPGI  
Fitch  which has established a domestic entity  and Moody s have also applied for licenses 
Josh Sheng  chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management  said domestic investors needed time to understand foreign agencies  ratings

115947,337462,SPGI,AWTAX Or BULIX  Which Utility Fund Should You Buy ,opinion,Mutual fund investors have regained their focus on the Utilities sector  owing to the recent spike in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East  The assassination of Iran s military chief by the United States toward the end of last week was the reason for heightened tensions in the region Utilities to be in High Demand in 2020The utilities sector put up a decent performance last year  gaining 26 4  throughout 2019  A primary reason behind the sector s growth last year was the ongoing U S  China trade conflict  which kept rattling the stock markets time to time  thus inducing volatility in the major indexes Investors thus opted to invest their assets into utilities  which are considered safe havens because of the nature of their products and services  This is why the defensive sector witnesses steady demand irrespective of market irregularities However  now the U S  China trade war is at bay  with Chinese delegates arriving in Washington on Jan 13 to sign the phase one trade deal between the two countries on Jan 15 But another threat has emerged  Qassem Soleimani  chief of Iranian military operations in Syria and Iraq  was killed in an airstrike authorized by President Donald Trump on Jan 3 in Baghdad  This puts the already hostile U S  Iran relations in a tough spot  as both countries exchanged heated words and actions over the course of the weekend Tehran said that the country would no longer stand by its 2015 nuclear pact with global powers  Trump had pulled U S  out of the nuclear deal in 2018  In addition  Trump reportedly threatened Iraq with harsh sanctions should the country follow through the resolution after its lawmakers voted to expel about 5 200 U S  troops stationed in the country to help fight Islamic State extremists Picking the Right Utilities FundKeeping the aforementioned developments in mind  one may note that geopolitical tensions have escalated recently  Therefore  it is rather imperative for fund investors to invest in utilities  However  choosing the right mutual funds for one s portfolio can be a rather tedious task Let us  therefore  take a look at two mutual funds that invest in the utilities sector and discuss which of these is best suited to your portfolio  Both the mutual funds mentioned below carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy  AllianzGI Global Water Fund Class A  aims for long term capital growth  The fund invests the majority of its assets in common stocks and other equity securities of companies that are represented in one or more of the S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Water Index  the NASDAQ OMX US Water  Global Water Indices or the S Network Global Water Index  The non diversified fund invests in companies that are solely engaged in water related activities This Sector Utilities product has a history of positive total returns for over 10 years   Specifically  the fund s returns are 10 7  over the 3 year and 7 5  of the 5 year period  To see how this fund performed compared in its category  and other  1 and  2 Ranked Mutual Funds   The AllianzGI Global Water Fund Class A  as of the last filing  allocates its assets in top two major groups   Foreign Stock and Intermediate Bond  Further  as of the last filing  American Water Works  Xylem Inc  NYSE XYL  W I and Danaher Corp  NYSE DHR  were the top holdings for AWTAX AWTAX was incepted on Mar 31  2008  and carries an expense ratio of 1 22   The fund requires a minimal initial investment of  1000 American Century Utilities Fund Investor Class  seeks current income and long term appreciation of capital and income  The fund invests the majority of its assets in equity securities of companies in the utilities sector  In a bid to build the fund s portfolio  the portfolio managers use quantitative and qualitative management techniques along with risk controls This Sector Utilities product has a history of positive total returns for over 10 years   Specifically  the fund s returns are 8 1  over the 3 year and 7  of the 5 year period  To see how this fund performed compared in its category  and other  1 and 2 Ranked Mutual Funds   The American Century Utilities Fund Investor Class  as of the last filing  allocates its assets in top two major groups   Intermediate Bond and Foreign Bond  Further  as of the last filing  AT T Inc  NYSE T   Verizon Communications  NYSE VZ  and Southern  NYSE SO  Co The were the top holdings for BULIX BULIX was incepted on Mar 01  1993  and carries an expense ratio of 0 67   The fund requires a minimal initial investment of  2500 ConclusionTaking a closer look at AWTAX and BULIX  we find that the latter clearly outpaces the former  Although both funds carry the same Zacks Rank and AWTAX has higher returns over the 3  and 5 year periods as compared to BULIX  the latter has much lesser risk associated with it than the former BULIX has a three year beta of 0 38  which is lower than AWTAX s 0 91  Second  BULIX s expense ratio is much lesser than that of AWTAX as well  Therefore one should buy BULIX as it offers lower risk  lower beta  and greater profitability  lower expense ratio  Want

115948,337463,SPGI,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook S P Global  SPGI ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends S P Global  NYSE SPGI  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this independent ratings and analytics provider is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for S P Global is 21 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 10 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  S P Global has an S TA ratio of 0 66  which means that the company gets  0 66 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 42  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And S P Global is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 6 1  this year versus the industry average of 5 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for S P Global have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
S P Global has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that S P Global is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2020-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-sp-global-spgi-200497394,200497394

115964,337479,SPGI,How China s Hidden Debt Is Getting Even Riskier,news," Bloomberg Opinion     In China  debt takes many shapes   on the books  off the books  or buried deep within the financial system  Now  debt can even be considered equity 
In a bid to boost the economy  China this week announced it would allow local governments to borrow more to fund infrastructure investment  As part of this push  it will let municipalities use the proceeds of special purpose bonds 4  as equity in railroad  highway and other projects  3  Previously  local governments weren t able to use such debt as seed capitUsing debt proceeds to fund equity is a dangerous proposition  Typically  equity holders take on extra risk  They re the first to assume losses and the last to get paid  That comes with higher returns  When an investment is leveraged  the ups and downs are magnified  too  Debtholders  meanwhile  have the first claim on cash flows  though their returns tend to be lower  The question now is whether investors get compensated for the risk when a project goes pear shaped   especially since bond repayments and project capital will both be dependent on underlying cash flows  
In China  there s plenty of room for doubt these investments will pan out  Beijing increased the quota for special purpose bond issuance to 2 15 trillion yuan   310 billion  from 1 35 trillion yuan in 2018  and around 40  has already been issued in the first five months of this year  Yet these large stimulus measures haven t amounted to much  even if they ve occasionally boosted the stocks of construction and engineering companies  Industrial profits fell 3 7  in April and fixed asset investment in manufacturing dropped 1 5  
Financing constraints for infrastructure investment  meanwhile  have become a persistent problem  Lending related to capital expenditure fell 26  in April  Reliance on short term debt has gone up  banks are still hesitant to extend loans to companies with encumbered balance sheets  and construction and engineering firms are already sitting on a mountain of debt  The latest measure could help many of these firms to borrow the minimum amount of equity they would need to meet regulatory capital ratio requirements of around 20  on most infrastructure projects 
Across the world  infrastructure projects are funded by a combination of debt and equity  The debt typically has long payback periods and equity is limited to 20  to 30  of the outlay  In theory  the assets funded by such investments have the potential for stable cash flows because they tend to be state mandated  used frequently and aren t cyclical  think  toll roads  
But that hasn t been the case in China  Projects that were bolstered by stimulus programs still don t make money  Last year  income from highways couldn t cover principal and interest payments on borrowings  Even if orders start rising  engineering and construction companies have been slow to convert these into revenue streams  Instead  long term receivables are piling up on their books  according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS    as cash flows deteriorate  This is even before the new round of building has started 
No doubt  China s bloated financial system and companies need more equity financing  Officials noted such a channel would help fund projects without adding debt off the books  Nomura Holdings Inc  estimates that municipalities  hidden debt 5  totaled 40 trillion yuan at the end of 2018  roughly double the amount of the central government s current levels  and has likely risen this year  That compares with official figures putting total local government debt at 21 2 trillion yuan  Falling returns on infrastructure have led to the deterioration in the quality of this debt over the last few years  Nomura analysts noted 
China s new policy could amount to an additional  13 billion to  19 billion of project capital from special purpose bond issuance through the rest of this year  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Inc  analysts estimate  In theory  adding equity helps secure bank financing  too  Beijing said the usage of special purpose bonds  proceeds for project capital would be closely monitored 
Ultimately  though  there s no getting around the fact that this debt is still the government s liability   even if it s being classified as project capital  And that burden is rising as fiscal coffers look weaker  Moody s Investors Service Inc  expects regional and local governments  leverage ratio to rise 3 percentage points from 2018 levels  reaching 23  of GDP by 2020  Beijing seems to be backtracking on its deleveraging efforts and going back to its old playbook  The stakes are only getting higher and the risks murkier 
 1  Special purpose bonds are off balance sheet debt issued by municipalities to fund construction projects  The logic is that the cash flows from these projects cover the bonds  interest and principal payments  Therefore  the credit profile of these bonds is independent of a local government s fiscal situation  and should be excluded from its budget 
 2  The projects have to meet certain requirements 
 3  The Nomura analysts broadly define two types of hidden debt  the debt of local government financing vehicles and some borrowing disguised as public private partnership equity funding  The bank says say the central government s figures should at least include the debt of the three policy banks and China Railway Corporation ",2019-06-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/how-chinas-hidden-debt-is-getting-even-riskier-1896244,1896244

By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss

Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio

In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And S P Global looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 6 1  this year versus the industry average of 5 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for S P Global  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 7  over the past month

115986,337501,SPGI,A Bunch Of Top Ranked Mega Cap ETFs To Bet On For 2020,opinion,Of late  Wall Street has been hitting new highs on several occasions  powered by chunks of upbeat data across the globe  easing monetary policies and optimism over the Sino US trade deal  The phase one trade deal reached between Washington and Beijing and the subsiding tensions over Brexit will provide a huge boost to the stock market  especially mega caps with large exposure to the international market  though general elections could weigh We enumerated the reasons in detail below for buying mega cap ETFs Trade DealIn the preliminary deal  China committed to buy  40 billion of American agricultural products annually  tighten measures for protecting American intellectual property and stop forcing American companies to transfer their technology while doing business in China  In return  President Donald Trump agreed to halt the planned tariffs on  156 billion of Chinese goods that were due to take effect from Dec 15 onward and also cut tariffs from 15  to 7 5  on  120 billion of Chinese goods that were imposed in September  However  the 25  tariff on  250 billion worth of Chinese imports levied in March 2018 will be intact U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer stated that the deal will boost U S  exports to China by  100 billion in 2021  nearly double from the current levels  read    Strong Macro TrendsThe U S  economy is on a strong growth path with job additions at the fastest pace this year  unemployment dropping to the lowest level since 1969 and third quarter GDP growth being revised upward from 1 9  to 2 1   The housing market is also clearly showing signs of a strong recovery as lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth are acting as catalysts  In another strong signal  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s survey measure of general business conditions in the next six months jumped to a five month high   Internationally  the initial deal erased fears of global growth concerns  The latest update from China shows that acceleration of industrial output and retail sales growth in November bolstered investors  confidence  Meanwhile  Japan s economy expanded more rapidly than initially reported in the third quarter  read    Cheap Money FlowsThe Federal Reserve slashed interest rates thrice this year while the European Central Bank lowered interest rates with a new round of bond purchases in a package of easing measures  Meanwhile  the Japan government plans to finalize an economic stimulus package of  120 billion to support its economy  Australia  New Zealand and the most developing and emerging economies including Indonesia  Korea  Russia  South Africa  Turkey  India and Brazil joined this easing spree Weakness in U S  DollarThe dovish Fed put pressure on the U S  dollar against the basket of currencies  The dollar index has been up around just 1  so far this year  A weak dollar bodes well for blue chip companies  which derive majority of revenues from international markets  This is because they made dollar denominated assets cheap for foreign investors  making U S  multinationals more competitive  thereby reaping higher profits  As such  companies with greater percentage of international sales will likely outperform Compelling ValuationThe blue chip index has an attractive valuation compared to other major indices  The benchmark has P E ratio to forward 12 months of  compared to that of 24 85 for the S P 500 and 36 99 for the Russell 2000  see    Top ETFs to Consider In view of the reasons

116025,337540,SPGI,4 Top Funds To Buy On Fed s Quarter Point Rate Cut,opinion,The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rates by an expected quarter point on Oct 30  The central bank s dovish stance was a result of lingering trade related concerns  uncertainty over the signing of a partial deal between the United States and China in November  low inflation  and a slowing global economy Despite the disappointing factors behind Fed s decision  the move comes as a boon to some of the sectors  In the current low interest rate scenario  sectors such as utility  telecommunications  real estate and precious metals are poised to gain the most  Mutual fund investors could thus consider investing in funds from these sectors Fed Cuts Rates for the Third Time in 2019The central bank s rate cuts were widely anticipated by market pundits and investors  After all  domestic economic data has been largely disappointing lately First  the U S  manufacturing sector  in September  registering the lowest reading since June 2009  On top of that new orders for manufactured durable goods declined 1 1  to  248 2 billion last month  per the  Second  consumers are also losing confidence in the economy  This was reflected in the Conference Board s Consumer Confidence   which declined in October for the third straight month to 125 9 Following the Federal Open Market Committee s two day meeting that concluded on Oct 30  the Fed slashed rates by 25 basis points  The current Federal rates now hover in the range of 1 5  to 1 75  This year s third rate cut was referred to as  midcycle adjustment  by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  According to Powell s statement  it s quite clear that the central bank will rely more on incoming data for any adjustments in the benchmark rates ahead  instead of a continuing goal to adjust rates lower Sectors Well Positioned for InvestmentsIn the current low interest environment  sectors such as utility  real estate  telecommunications and precious metals  gold  could be ideal for investment High dividend yielding  capital intensive sectors such as utility  real estate and telecommunications have vast infrastructure that need to be maintained  thus requiring considerable expenditure  A low rate environment makes it easier for companies to borrow from financial institutions  This is likely to improve the companies  efficiency and thus push their profit margins higher Second  investing in gold mutual funds could offer higher returns as well  Gold is considered a safe haven for investors who wish to hedge their savings in times of economic downturns  At present  Fed s easing policy and increasing uncertainty on the trade front may drive gold s demand higher Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  selected four mutual funds from the aforementioned sectors

116029,337544,SPGI,Near Term Bright Prospects For Alternative Energy Stocks,opinion,The Zacks  industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies  While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind  natural gas  biofuel  hydro and geothermal  the other set is engaged in development  design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions  which gained popularity as an affordable clean energy of late Per the latest Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report  the year 2018 marked the fifth successive period in which global investment in renewable exceeded  250 billion   According to a BloombergNEF study  investment in clean energy is set to hit  2 6 trillion in the years from 2010 through the end of 2019 with the United States being a major contributor Here are the industry s three major themes Among alternative energy sources  wind energy continues to make noticeable progress in the United States  Per American Wind Energy Association s latest report  the country reached the milestone of generating 100 gigawatts of wind energy at the end of third quarter 2019  This growth was driven by increased installations of wind projects that touched maximum in any given third quarter on record  Installations for the year totalaled 3 667 MW  reflecting a 123  surge from the first three quarters of 2018  Courtesy of energy developers  intensified focus on large scale off shore wind projects  the recent tax credit extension bills introduced by the U S  Senate and declining installation costs  the U S  wind space should remain buoyant  With projections that wind power will secure investments worth  1 trillion for the decade ending 2019  the outlook for the alternative energy industry seems favorable  The outlook for the alternative energy industry is also encouraging as utilities and corporations are increasingly shifting to renewables  This shift can be attributed to lower cost of generating electricity from alternative energy sources and storing the same  thanks to rapid technological advancements  Per International Renewable Energy Agency  cost of all commercially available renewable power generation technologies declined in 2018  By 2020  onshore wind is set to join hydropower in consistently offering a less expensive source of new electricity than the least cost fossil fuel alternative without financial assistance  This indicates that alternative energy sources can be profitable for industry players  Thus  stocks in this industry should remain prudent choices for investors  Per a report by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  with U S  states increasingly adopting favorable renewable portfolio standards  existing technologies are not adequate to support their ambitious 100  clean energy goals  In particular  the stakes are high when it comes to transmission costs  Per a report by Wood Mackenzie  the United States currently has about 200 000 miles of high voltage transmission  HVT  and achieving 100  renewables will require doubling of these transmission lines  The addition of 200 000 miles of new HVT will add  700 billion to the total price of grid decarbonization  excluding the cost of materials  Going by the report  the total cost of shifting the U S  power grid to 100  renewable energy over the next 10 years is an estimated  4 5 trillion  So  no doubt  investments are promoting clean energy but at a high price Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  103  which places it in the top 41  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright near term prospects  Our research shows

116044,337559,SPGI,China March exports rebound to five month high but imports fall more than expected,news,"By Lusha Zhang and Kevin Yao BEIJING  Reuters    China s exports rebounded in March but imports shrank for a fourth straight month and at a sharper pace  painting a mixed picture of the economy as trade talks with the United States reach their endgame   Investors are hoping for signs of economic recovery in China to temper worries about slowing global growth  after the IMF this week downgraded its 2019 world outlook for the third time  But veteran China watchers had said export gains may be due more to seasonal factors than any sudden turnaround in lackluster global demand  as shipments were expected to jump after long holidays in February  March exports rose 14 2 percent from a year earlier  customs data showed on Friday  the strongest growth in five months  Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7 3 percent gain after February s 20 8 percent plunge  Shipments picked up around 3 percent month on month  suggesting some improvement in foreign demand  Julian Evans Pritchard  senior China economist at Capital Economics  said in a note  But he said exports have yet to fully recover from a sharp slowdown late last year   With global growth set to remain weak in the coming quarters  a strong rebound in exports looks unlikely   he said   Adding to the worries  China s imports fell more than expected  suggesting its domestic demand remains weak  Imports fell 7 6 percent from a year earlier  worse than analysts  forecasts for a 1 3 percent fall and widening from February s 5 2 percent drop  That left the country with a trade surplus of  32 64 billion for the month  according to Reuters calculations based on the official data  much larger than forecasts of  7 05 billion  In the first quarter  exports rose 1 4 percent from a year earlier  while imports fell 4 8 percent  A customs spokesman said he expects mild growth in both exports and imports in the current quarter  China also released lending data on Friday that  unlike trade  was unambiguously strong   Chinese banks extended 1 69 trillion yuan   251 59 billion  in net new yuan loans in March  up sharply from February and far more than expected  as policymakers push bankers to keep lending to struggling smaller companies  even at the risk of more bad loans   Total bank lending in the first three months of 2019 hit a record quarterly tally of 5 81 trillion yuan  suggesting months of policy loosening by the central bank are starting to bear fruit  Strong credit growth is likely to reinforce analysts  views that the economy will stabilize later in the year after a rocky first half  TENTATIVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY China factory surveys for March had provided some glimmers of hope that demand was improving at home and abroad  suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold  While export orders remained sluggish  there were signs that a long spell of contraction was easing even as trade talks with the United States appeared to be making progress  Washington and Beijing have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach  including establishing new  enforcement offices   U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday  However  a top White House official said on Monday the U S  side is  not satisfied yet  about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U S  China trade war  President Donald Trump said last week that an agreement could be reached in about four weeks  But economists warn that even if a deal is reached  and both sides rescind tit for tat tariffs  Chinese exporters will still have to contend with weakening demand globally   The International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2019 global growth forecast this week to 3 3 percent  while slightly boosting its forecast for China to 6 3 percent  in part because the Sino U S  trade war did not escalate as much as expected  Chinese exporters will also likely have to scramble to win back lost market share  The trade dispute has prompted some U S  firms to shift purchases of tariff targeted products like furniture and refrigerators to countries such as Vietnam  South Korea  Taiwan and Mexico  according to a report by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Market Intelligence s trade data firm Panjiva  China s trade surplus with the United States  a major source of frustration for Washington  rose nearly 40 percent in March from February to  20 5 billion and hit  62 66 billion in the first quarter   SHRINKING IMPORTS On imports  analysts said companies may not be restocking inventories as much as usual due to concerns over the longer term economic outlook and global trade  though an infrastructure push is likely to see imports of raw materials improve   Slackening demand has sent corporate profits into a tailspin  which could curb the fresh investment that Beijing is counting on to fuel an economic revival  Policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure as multi year debt and pollution crackdown have deterred investment  while the trade war is increasingly hurting China s exporters and their domestic supply chains  In response  Beijing has announced more spending on roads  railways and ports  along with trillions of yuan of tax cuts to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets and avert a sharper economic slowdown  State controlled banks are also being urged to keep lending to companies that are struggling  Investors are closely watching to see how long it will take those support measures to take hold  But analysts believe China will still need to loosen policy further in coming months to ensure a sustained economic turnaround

116048,337563,SPGI,Five challenges for Ukraine s new president,news,By Marc Jones and Tom Arnold LONDON  Reuters    Ukraine has entered uncharted political waters by choosing Volodymyr Zelenskiy  a comedian with no previous political experience and few detailed policies  as its new president   Zelenskiy is the latest anti establishment figure to unseat an incumbent leader  both in Europe and further afield  but he has a lot to get to grips with  Below are five big questions investors and the international community have  1 STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT  Zelenskiy is expected to take office next month and his ability to work with Ukraine s parliament  the Rada  will be crucial to meeting the expectations of his voters  The president appoints the head of the state security service  the head of the military  the general prosecutor  the central bank governor and the foreign and defense ministers  But parliament must confirm each appointment    and there s the rub  While Zelenskiy beat incumbent Petro Poroshenko decisively in Sunday s presidential vote  parliamentary elections are not due until October and opinion polls suggest he is unlikely to win an outright majority   That means he would need to ally with at least one other party if he is to get many of his policies and appointments through  The other alternative is to try to bring the elections forward in order to capitalize on the momentum from his presidential victory   2 TEAM BUILDING EXERCISE With no political experience himself  investors want Zelenskiy to build a team with enough know how to avoid any policy missteps  He does not actually have a full slate of policies yet but he brought in two former ministers as advisers for his campaign  former finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk and former economy minister Aivaras Abromavicius  Danylyuk is rumored to be in line to become either foreign minister or the head of the presidential administration  which would give him a powerful gatekeeper role   Zelenskiy might be inexperienced in foreign affairs but I think he will have plenty of choice of experienced individuals to serve as foreign minister  and will receive plenty of support  advice from Western governments   wrote Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management  3 IMF International Monetary Fund aid has kept Ukraine s economy above water so its ongoing support is seen as crucial  especially with around  3 billion  about 2 percent of GDP  of external debt obligations  including interest  coming due in the remainder of 2019  Another  5 5 billion  about 4 percent of GDP  must be repaid in 2020   But Ukraine s patchy reform efforts led to repeated delays in its previous IMF program that ended up disbursing only  8 7 billion of a planned  17 5 billion   That was replaced by a new  3 9 billion Stand By Arrangement  SBA  in December  While Kiev hopes for another tranche of that money as early as next month  investors will want to see a fuller program put back in place soon  It could be an interesting negotiation  Zelenskiy already wants to talk the IMF about reversing some gas price rises the Fund saw as crucial to mending Kiev s finances   Ukraine s economic backdrop has improved in recent years though  with much smaller twin deficits  2 3 percent of GDP   lower public sector debt  just over 60 percent  and a stable currency  It also has over  20 billion in FX reserves  which is over four months of import cover  according to S P Global  NYSE SPGI    4 PRIVATBANK PROBLEMS One concern is Zelenskiy s ties to oligarch Igor Kolomoisky  the former owner of Ukraine s biggest lender PrivatBank  which was nationalized in 2016  With the international community already concerned about corruption and influence  some have raised questions about what their relationship might mean for the future of PrivatBank and other interests of Kolomoisky in Ukraine   A court ruling last week could threaten to overturn the nationalization of PrivatBank   The central bank has said it will appeal    in fact there could be many appeals as well as other legal manoeuvres    but any sign that Zelenskiy might be in Kolomoisky s camp on this could do serious damage  not least to relations with the IMF  5 RUSSIA RELATIONS As world leaders clamored to offer their congratulations to Zelenskiy  one notable name was absent  Russian President Vladimir Putin  How the Russian speaking Zelenskiy handles Ukraine s relationship with Moscow will go a long way to determining the success of his term in office  He has already suggested taking a fresh perspective to try to secure peace with Moscow  while pushing ahead with European Union friendly moves  That could prove a difficult path to tread  For its part  Russia has signaled it intends to respect the vote of the Ukraine people  although Putin is not planning talks with Zelenskiy  Also rumbling in the background is a legal dispute between the two surrounding Ukraine s  3 billion Eurobond  which Moscow wants repaid in full but which Kiev argues should have been written down along with most of its other debt in 2015  Any repairing of ties could also bring rewards for Ukraine  Improved relations could help it regain control over the separatist controlled east  as well as cheap gas and major investment  a Kremlin ally in Ukraine said last week

116050,337565,SPGI,Corbyn proof  British water  power firms take nationalization precautions,news,"By Virginia Furness  Sujata Rao and Julien Ponthus LONDON  Reuters    British water and power firms are trying to soothe nerves over nationalization in the event of a Labour government  although some fund managers and lawyers doubt so called Corbyn proofing will work  Jeremy Corbyn  the opposition leader  has said the state would take control of Britain s water  electricity  gas and railway operators  as well as  Royal Mail   LON RMG  and Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS  if Labour wins power  The privatization of utilities  which began in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher s Conservatives  has been a divisive issue  While supporters say consumers get a better deal  critics argue that there is no place for profit in public services  Now  with Labour gaining in the polls and a general election seen as more likely following a delay to Britain s European Union departure  companies and investors are taking the possibility of nationalization seriously  Thames Water  for instance  added a clause to its bonds to ensure holders are repaid immediately should it be nationalized  Bankers say this reflects demand for extra protection as investors grow more wary about British utilities   While references to nationalization as a default event for utility companies are not new  several lawyers said they are seeing a surge in company inquiries about inserting such clauses  as well as an increase in investment firms seeking advice  Reuters reported last year that many foreign pension and investment funds were opting to shift their stakes in UK utilities to jurisdictions such as Hong Kong  where bilateral treaties protect against asset expropriation  Lawyers said this process was continuing   Your biggest fear as a bond investor is if your bond gets nationalized for less than market value   Dan Neidle  partner at Clifford Chance  said    Labour have said they will honor the debts of nationalized businesses  but a large number of investors and infrastructure businesses remain concerned  The discussions we are having are increasing over time   Neidle added  without giving any names  Some companies began seeing higher borrowing costs last year and a London based capital markets banker highlighted the case of Western Power Distribution  which was unable to tighten the pricing on a 350 million pound   452 million  bond in October   We have seen some foreign investors hold their hands up and say we are not looking at UK infrastructure   the banker said   There were a lot of questions about Corbyn on the roadshow   IMPOSSIBLE TASK  But can investors really insure against nationalization  Some say a Labour government could simply change the law to annul a Thames Water type provision and swap any cash due for government issued gilts   It is probably impossible to  Corbyn proof  a corporate s debt in this way   one capital markets lawyer said  Harry Richards  who co manages Jupiter Asset Management s Corporate Bond Fund  said that whatever it may say before an election  a Labour government may ultimately not want to risk undermining business confidence with a change to the law   Historically the UK has been viewed as a bit of a golden child in terms of enforceability of UK law and how the UK law is valued     it would very much undermine that   Nevertheless Richards went underweight in British utilities midway through last year  arguing that nationalization risk means they are no longer a safe bet  Another factor which may make Labour think twice about a wide nationalization plan is the expense   S P Global  NYSE SPGI  puts the cost of taking the water and power sectors back into state hands at some 160 billion pounds   210 billion   based on the regulated asset value of the companies  A Labour party spokesperson said   The benefits of taking water into public ownership are clear  ending rip off prices and excessive dividends for private companies and investing in the long term future of our economy    CORBYN DISCOUNT  While it is difficult to disentangle the Corbyn effect on share and debt prices from the impact of Brexit or regulatory squeezes  analysts say it is definitely there among utilities  which comprise around a fifth of the UK corporate bond market   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  strategist Mark Freshney noted shares in utilities fell by around 35 percent in the nine months after Labour outlined its plans in May 2017   The nationalization debate has taken something like 10 15 percent off the share prices   Freshney said   At the moment there is probably a 5 7 5 percent discount in the shares   Any Corbyn discount is most visible in bonds issued in a holding company structure often used by utilities to raise debt  These  holdcos  are unsecured  lack operating licenses and assets and their bonds  such as those issued by Western  rank lower than the operating companies  known as  opcos   Jonathan Constable  an analyst at Legal   General Investment Management  estimates that UK regulated opco debt is in the region of 70 100 billion pounds  and holdco debt    the most vulnerable category    equates to just 5 percent of that    We have a preference for opco debt  which is safer in a nationalization event  it could be viewed as a government proxy in event of a nationalization  in which case the price could go up   Jupiter s Richards said  This dichotomy is visible in bonds from Anglian Water and its holdco Osprey Finance  Similarly  Kelda Finance has seen its bonds underperform that of its opco Yorkshire Water   It s largely down to people refusing to invest as long as the nationalization overhang is there   said Constable   GRAPHIC  Shares in UK utilities lag    GRAPHIC  2026

116074,337589,SPGI,Pemex Is Too Big to Fail and Investors Are Finally Catching On,news," Bloomberg     True believers in Petroleos Mexicanos are fueling a rally in its bonds  reckoning that government support for the beleaguered state owned company will ultimately provide a backstop from any troubles 
Investors including MetLife  NYSE MET   Pictet and SMBC Nikko Securities say Pemex s bonds were overly punished last year amid concerns the government isn t doing enough to address the company s problems  The challenge of falling production given Pemex s  108 billion of debt and high taxes is real  but optimists argue its yields shouldn t be much above sovereign notes 
 The ironic thing about Pemex is that the worse the credit profile deteriorates  the more it becomes a sovereign credit   said Roger Horn  a senior emerging markets strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York who is traveling to Mexico with a group of investors next week to scout opportunities 
Pemex s benchmark bonds due in 2027 returned 4 1 percent last month  almost three times the average for a Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  index of government and quasi sovereign notes from emerging markets  The extra yield the notes pay above similar maturity securities from the government has fallen to 2 5 percentage points    still about 50 basis points over the past year s average  but down from 2 95 percentage points in early January  The spread is as high as 5 percentage points for some euro  and peso  denominated bonds 
Mexico s state oil producer had suffered in bond markets in recent months as some analysts and investors began to view its problems as so big that even implied government backing wasn t enough to put their minds at ease  Generally  notes from state owned companies    known as quasi sovereigns    are seen as less risky because of the government backstop 
 Mexico s significantly greater budgetary dependence on Pemex likely implies a greater chance of the company receiving government aid  if it needs it  according to Jaimin Patel  an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence who says the Mexican producer s credit rating might be a full eight levels lower without the government backing 
Guido Chamorro  who manages  4 5 billion of assets as co head of emerging market hard currency debt at Pictet  recently added to his holdings of Pemex s 2027 bonds  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Chamorro says that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will do what it takes to shore up the company s footing  He s on the lookout for a rating downgrade    S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings and Fitch Ratings have said they may cut the producer s investment grade ranking    because any dip in prices could be an opportunity to buy more 
 Pemex still makes money  It s simply not allowed to keep it   Chamorro said from London  lamenting the company s high tax burden  Still   default is not an issue over the foreseeable future  
Fitch cut Pemex s rating by two steps earlier this year to BBB   the lowest investment grade  Moody s has Pemex at the same level  while S P has it two levels higher at BBB   The company s ratio of net debt to a measure of earnings  an indication of indebtedness  was 3 7 at the end of last year  among the highest globally 
The press departments at Pemex and Mexico s Finance Ministry didn t immediately return messages seeking comment

116076,337591,SPGI,Mobius Says Don t Buy Dubai Property Before  Real Slump ,news," Bloomberg     Three years ago  Mark Mobius saw his luxury apartments in Dubai go up in flames  While the suites have by now been restored to their old splendor  the investor has something else to worry about  the frenzy of construction that s adding to the existing glut in real estate 
The downturn  will get much worse from here   said Mobius  a pioneer in emerging market investing  adding he d hold off on buying more property   I would probably want to wait until there s a real slump when all this new building comes in and people are really hurting  
Prices and rents have already dropped by as much as a third in the past five years during what S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings has called the property market s  long decline   The slump will run for another 12 to 18 months because government measures to stimulate the economy    including granting long term visas which benefit the affluent and people with specialized expertise    won t be enough to revive demand  said Lahlou Meksaoui  a Dubai based analyst at Moody s Investors Service 
Mobius recalls how he watched on television from Singapore as revelers in Dubai rang in 2016 with fireworks shooting off the iconic Burj Khalifa  Just steps away from the world s tallest building  flames were engulfing Address Downtown and the two luxury apartments he owns in the 63 story tower 
Dubai  one of seven of the United Arab Emirates  lives and dies by real estate  When a property bubble burst a decade ago  it needed a  20 billion rescue from neighboring Abu Dhabi to pull back from the brink of default  Since prices peaked in 2014  the  108 billion economy had a softer landing as it transitioned from boom to bust 
Early signs of a bottoming out in the property sector even prompted  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  to  double upgrade  U A E  stocks in February  An index tracking the city s real estate and construction stocks climbed 5 8 percent in the first three months of the year  snapping five quarters of losses  The gauge advanced 0 1 percent on Thursday 
But Mobius said shares of Dubai s developers aren t cheap enough  While the World Expo 2020 fair will reinforce the city s position on the world map  it won t be enough to revive the emirate s property sector unless the government relaxes its immigration policies  he said 
 That s where you re going to have real problems   he said

limited profit potential as early as 2017  Then on Feb  22  Qinghai Provincial Investment Group  QPIG   rated AA by three agencies including Dagong Global Credit Rating Co Ltd  became the first state owned enterprise in decades to miss a deadline for an offshore bond coupon payment  Ratingdog  however  had warned in 2017 of QPIG s  very large susceptibility  to a downturn  giving it a speculative grade rating of 7 out of 10  Both Minsheng and QPIG subsequently made delayed payments   For a graphic on  Investors demand more from riskier debt  click   IMPLICIT SUPPORT While quantifying Ratingdog s reach is difficult  Josh Sheng  chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management  said a  large proportion  of domestic mutual funds and securities companies refer to its ratings and pricing  In contrast  many investors all but ignore official ratings  which rank most issuers as AA or higher  implying little default risk and giving little guidance on pricing  That is despite efforts by Beijing to improve the quality of ratings and strengthen oversight  including freezing Dagong s core ratings business last August for violating industry rules  One reason for the preponderance of highly rated firms in China is an implicit assumption of state backing  Jean Charles Sambor  deputy head of emerging market debt at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Asset Management  said analysis of issuing companies has tended to focus on the likelihood of government support  rather than balance sheets   We basically don t use official ratings for our investment decisions  and they re not even very meaningful as a reference   said Liu Xiaofang  head of investment research at Shanghai Fengshi Asset Management Ltd  More than a month after Minsheng Investment s technical default  and with the yield on a Shanghai traded 4 88 percent Minsheng bond hovering above 13 percent  the company continues to boast an untarnished AAA issuer rating  Ratingdog has rated Minsheng bonds at 7 10 since December  a level indicating  many credit issues  and a recommendation to avoid  Shanghai Brilliance and Dagong did not respond to Reuters  requests for comment  ISSUER PAY Drawn in part by the imminent inclusion of Chinese bonds in global indexes  foreign rating agencies have been racing to set up shop in China  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings recently became the first global agency to receive a license to rate Chinese onshore bonds  Fitch Ratings  which has established a domestic entity  and Moody s Investors Service have also applied for licenses  Some investors hope that the international agencies will encourage greater ratings transparency  However  S P Global will follow an  issuer pay  model in China  similar to the one that domestic agencies currently use  Many investors in China have been wary of the practice  whereby ratings are given to issuers enlisting the agency s services  S P provides issuer pay ratings in other markets and says it has measures in place to guard against potential conflicts of interest  Its ratings of some Chinese issuers of both onshore and offshore debt  including QPIG  are notably different from those of domestic agencies  But  says Ratingdog s Yao   There s a problem here  and it s a problem with overseas agencies  too  and that is  In the end  who are you serving  Is it investors or issuers    DIFFERENT ROAD  While interest is high for Ratingdog s products  monetizing that demand may prove difficult  Only companies officially licensed to rate securities are permitted to charge for rating services in China  But Yao plans to press ahead anyway  by introducing investor paid customised research alongside its free analysis    Charging for services is meant to help speed up our development and expansion  but it s also to understand real market demand   he said   After all  the only real demand is demand that s willing to pay   Ratingdog s growth could pose problems for it in what Hayden Briscoe  head of Asia Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management  calls  a very licensed regime    I would suspect that he wouldn t last for very long unless he had a proper license   Briscoe said of Yao  A senior rating industry source  who follows Ratingdog on WeChat  said that regulatory requirements are  very strict   including annual audits with on site checks conducted by regulators   If you give a rating  you also need to bear responsibility for it   he said  Yao said he is following a  different road  and not seeking a rating license  but how to operate legally is  a long term consideration   BOTTOM UP SHIFT Ratingdog is not alone in looking to feed the market s hunger for information  Domestic brokerages and investment banks offer sell side credit research  often bundled for free alongside equity research   One bank even uses a Ratingdog like canine theme for bond analysis in its proprietary app  BNP s Sambor said the rise of these alternatives indicates a broader shift   What policymakers are trying to achieve is to make sure that investors are looking at credit research from a bottom up perspective rather than a top down perspective   he said  A  massive repricing  of onshore corporate bonds in the past 18 months has followed attempts to introduce more credit risk into the market  encouraging differentiation and better price discovery  Sambor said  The spread of riskier 5 year AA corporate debt over AAA debt of the same tenor was 101 basis points on March 12  56 basis points wider than at the end of 2017  Still  even after 2018 saw a record level of corporate defaults  Chinese issuers remain relatively unlikely to default  The marginal default rate   the proportion of the value of defaulting bonds to that of total outstanding credit bonds   was just 0 07 percent in December  according to China Central Depository and Clearing Co   With defaults comparatively rare  developing reliable ratings will take time  said Yao  noting that global agencies and markets have had more

116110,337625,SPGI,Five Key Things We Learned at Xi Jinping s Annual Policy Summit,news," Bloomberg     China s annual gathering of leaders in Beijing ended Friday after eleven days of meetings that unveiled a lower annual growth target  sweeping tax cuts  and a new foreign investment law 
There also were new insights on the government s strategy to rein in debt  its efforts to funnel more credit to private companies and improve the business environment  and the trade negotiations with the U S  There were even some rare comments on the Xinjiang region s controversial mass detention camps 
 Maintaining overall stability seems to have become the paramount objective   said Chen Xingdong  chief China economist at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  SA in Beijing   Policymakers seem to feel that implementing the China U S  trade deal will create pressure  
Here are five takeaways 
The Economy
The message on the economy was clear  China won t resort to debt fueled stimulus  is doubling down on efforts to get more credit to efficient private companies  and is striving to improve the business environment for them and foreign companies  It lowered the annual growth target to 6 to 6 5 percent from about 6 percent last year  creating the wiggle room to shift away from credit fueled expansion while avoiding past credit blowouts 
The almost 2 trillion yuan of tax cuts announced is unprecedented and Finance Minister Liu Kun said the actual amount may be higher  To help pay for it while raising the budget deficit target only 0 2 percentage point to 2 8 percent of gross domestic product  Premier Li Keqiang said at his annual press conference Friday that the  blade of the knife  will be turned on the government itself  About 1 trillion yuan will be utilized from the profits of central state enterprises and financial institutions as well as by mobilizing existing idle funds  Li said 
 The lowering of the growth target reflects that policymakers have come to accept the reality of lower growth in exchange for long term sustainability   said Michelle Lam  a greater China economist at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA in Hong Kong 
Hidden Debt
The campaign to rein in leverage is shifting to so called hidden debt  referring to off balance sheet loans or borrowings of local government entities  Across the country  provinces and cities are looking for ways to reduce their implicit borrowings  Some are seeking cheap refinancing from the nation s largest policy lender  the China Development Bank  and others are selling off state owned assets such as office buildings and housing 
Hidden debt in some places exceeds the on book borrowing  said Zhu Mingchun  a lawmaker of the National People s Congress  without naming places directly  Payments due for local government financing vehicle debt  just part of the off book borrowing  could reach 2 3 trillion yuan this year  according to estimates by Industrial Securities Co  in Hong Kong  The fact that there is no official estimate of the size of the implicit debt  which usually carries higher rates than on book ones  makes the issue even trickier  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Inc  estimated in October that hidden debt totals about 40 trillion yuan 
 The problem can t be delayed anymore   as in many places fiscal revenues and gross domestic product aren t enough to cover the interest and principal  said Lu Ting  chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc 
Foreign Investment Law
The passage of a new foreign investment law Friday allows  on paper at least  for all companies registered in China to compete on equal terms from Jan 1  2020  Forced technology transfers are banned  applications for operating licenses will be treated equally  and government support will apply equally to foreign firms  All are controversial issues that helped trigger the trade war with the U S 
While Societe Generale SA says the new law  passed with unusual speed  is symbolically important and marks a further opening up step  foreign companies complain that China has for years been long on promises and short on their delivery  They ll wait to see if the law will be forcefully executed 
 Implementation and enforcement has long been the missing ingredient in China   said Katrina Ell  an economist with Moody s Analytics in Sydney   Enforcement is critical for it to be effective  
Trade Talks
It wasn t on the agenda but there was no way the ongoing trade negotiations with the U S  could be ignored  China kept its cards close to its chest while pushing back a tad against U S  demands  notably when vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen said any mechanism to enforce an agreement must be two way  That  suggests difficulties in how to word the implementation mechanism   said BNP Paribas  Chen  Former finance minister Lou Jiwei was more blunt  saying China won t make big concessions and that some U S  demands are  just nitpicking  
Xinjiang
The meeting created a rare opportunity for officials to respond to international criticism about the Xinjiang region s notorious mass detention camps  They were unequivocal  The Muslim region will maintain them for a  long time   said government chief Shohrat Zakir  at a meeting packed with reporters  reflecting the intense scrutiny on the region 
An ethnic Uighur  Zakir disputed the term  re education centers   likening the camps instead to vocational training centers that are similar to boarding schools   The fight against instability  extremism and secessionism is long  complex and intense   Zakir told a public question session   We can t relax for a moment at any time

116112,337627,SPGI,Schroders Calls Fed s Scary Auto Delinquency Data  Fake News ,news," Bloomberg     A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showing auto loan delinquencies at near peak levels is  a good example of fake news   Schroder Investment Management North America Inc  said in a note this week 
Delinquencies are actually low by historical standards  according to the firm  which invests in asset backed securities  The Fed s data was calculated to include loan balances that have already been charged off  which exaggerates delinquency numbers   Schroders   LON SDR  said 
If defaults that have already been taken as a loss  so called chargeoffs  are removed from the data set as is the common practice for most indices  it s clear that auto loan delinquencies are at relatively low levels  Schroders said  They are certainly below what was seen during the financial crisis era  In fact  U S  consumer performance overall is generally strong 
 While there has been a modest expansion in consumer credit  delinquency levels and defaults are back to the low end of historical levels   said Michelle Russell Dowe  head of securitized credit at Schroders  in a telephone interview   This good performance is an important consideration that is not well represented by commonly sourced government agency reports such as the New York Fed auto delinquency data  
The Fed said that delinquencies were high despite low unemployment and a benign economy  However  Russell Dowe also points to the fact that bankruptcy filings are at a 10 year low  calling that a  good and meaningful generic indicator  of overall consumer health 
The New York Fed s report last month showed that payments that fell behind by 90 days or more reached 4 47 percent in the fourth quarter  the highest since the first quarter of 2012  However  these levels are significantly higher than rates seen in a comparable  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co  90 plus day auto ABS delinquency index  which excludes charged off loans and shows delinquency levels under 1 percent for a mix of bundled prime and subprime auto loans 
S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings had a similar message this week  saying in a research note that 90 plus day delinquencies for S P rated prime and subprime auto loan ABS was only 0 11 percent and 1 86 percent  respectively  as of Dec  31  S P also noted that delinquencies have been rising faster than actual loss levels on the packaged loans  which is said is a more important indicator  Credit protections in the deals  or cushions against loss  have increased commensurately with rising risk  according to S P 
Deep Subprime Proliferating
Only 14 percent of auto loans originated last year were packaged into bonds  S P said  but the securitization markets are typically used more often by so called deep subprime lenders  rather than banks and credit unions  Even so  the ABS delinquency levels are still far less than the NY Fed numbers  pointing to the differences in calculation method 
Both Schroders and S P acknowledged that delinquency levels have increased notably for asset backed bonds underpinned by deep subprime borrowers  There has been growth in deep subprime lending over the last few years as private equity and venture capital firms have invested in auto lenders specializing in the least credit worthy borrowers  pushing volumes amid increased competition 
 Subprime delinquencies of 30 days or more are back at their peak  and subprime borrowers don t benefit as much from low unemployment as in the prime market   said Schroders  Russell Dowe   Additionally  the share of these private equity backed subprime auto issuers in the ABS market has risen quickly  back in 2011 it was perhaps 10 percent  and now it s closer to 50 percent  
Then again  securitized debt makes up just a fraction of the overall auto credit market  while the majority is kept on finance companies  balance sheets  Only about 10 percent of the  437 billion of low rated car loans have been turned into ABS  according to Wells Fargo ",2019-03-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/schroders-calls-feds-scary-auto-delinquency-data-fake-news-1814616,1814616

116122,337637,SPGI,Mexico Keeps Key Interest Rate Steady,news," Bloomberg     Mexico kept borrowing costs unchanged as mounting debt at the state oil company threatens to undermine confidence in the government s finances even as the consensus sees inflation moderating 
The central bank  led by Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon  kept the benchmark rate at a decade high 8 25 percent  in line with all 26 economists in a Bloomberg survey  Analysts had also unanimously forecast a hold last month  More recently  the U S  Federal Reserve this week slashed its projected interest rate increases for this year to zero from two 
Slowing inflation  a stronger currency  a dovish Fed and forecasts for weaker growth now have economists and investors pricing in Mexico s first rate cut since 2014 for as soon as mid year  The reason rates are remaining steady at all is because Petroleos Mexicanos  the world s most indebted oil major  could trigger a sovereign rating downgrade that could in turn spur capital flight and peso weakness  according to JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  
The central bank  needs to anchor inflation expectations now   the bank s chief economist Gabriel Lozano  before the rate decision   As long as uncertainty on the new Pemex plan reigns  policymakers will remain very concerned  as the risk of a downgrade is quite big in our view  
Lozano doesn t see an interest rate cut until next year as labor unions push up wages with job actions and salary demands  which may trigger inflation  Most economists  however  expect rates to start falling in November  according to the median estimate in a Citibanamex survey  They also foresee inflation falling to 3 70 percent by year end  and the economy growing only 1 5 percent  down from 2 0 percent last year

116142,337657,SPGI,China says meets debt control target as it ramps up economic support,news,"By Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee BEIJING  Reuters    China has met its target for reducing debt levels but will keep cracking down on riskier types of financing to contain risks to its financial system  the banking and insurance regulator said on Monday  urging banks to step up lending to smaller companies   Concern about China s debt is rising again as Beijing ramps up support for a slowing economy  New bank loans hit a record in January despite increasing bad loans and record defaults in 2018  Though top officials have repeatedly pledged not to resort to another massive spending spree like that during the global financial crisis  analysts say it is vital for policymakers to revive weak credit growth to avoid a sharper slowdown   After two years of work  various financial disorders have been effectively curbed   Wang Zhaoxing  vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission  CBIRC   told a news conference   This breaks overseas predictions that the  barbaric  growth of shadow banking and the financial overheating of real estate might lead to systemic financial risks and crises in China   China has never revealed a specific target for its multi year risk containment campaign and does not release comprehensive statistics on debt loads  But documents provided by the regulator said the leverage level in the economy stabilized in 2018  meeting the target  after growing by an average of more than 10 percent a year   Our leverage level is basically stable  This is a marvelous achievement   said Zhou Liang  another CBIRC vice chairman  Authorities have tried since a 2015 downturn to curb riskier types of financing and a build up in debt which international monitors like the International Monetary Fund say could trigger a banking crisis in the world s second largest economy  However  the regulatory pressure drove up borrowing costs last year and made it harder for small firms to secure funding  dragging on business activity and prompting policymakers to shift their focus back to growth boosting measures  Analysts worry that any halt to the financial risk campaign may also delay much needed structural reforms  such as allowing market forces to dictate a more efficient use of capital   Corporate bond defaults hit a record last year  while banks  non performing loan ratio hit a 10 year high  but authorities have kept pressure on largely state owned  banks to keep lending to cash strapped companies facing  temporary  difficulties  The last round of China s leverage crackdown is over for now  said Hao Zhou  senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank  DE CBKG   adding that the cycle of policy tightening and loosening normally shifts every two to three years    Although China is loosening now  it s possible that the loosening will end as soon as economic growth gathers momentum   he said   END DISCRIMINATION The regulator said in a statement on Monday that it had ordered all of the country s banks to sharply increase financial support for private companies  with big state owned banks told to increase loans to smaller firms by more than 30 percent  The private sector accounts for over half of China s economic growth and most of its new jobs  but firms have been facing higher borrowing costs and a tougher time obtaining financing as they carry higher credit risks than state firms  The regulator said banks will now be prohibited from discriminatory practices when approving loans for private firms  To crack down on  rampant and blind  expansion of financial institutions  the CBIRC has targeted practices ranging from less regulated interbank activities to the shadow banking sector  which has been a major funding source for private companies  It has also pressed banks to speed up disposal of bad loans and encouraged companies to convert debt into equity to free up capital for new lending  The scale of high risk assets shrank by about 12 trillion yuan   1 79 trillion  in the previous two years  while lenders disposed of 3 48 trillion yuan in non performing loans  the regulator said  More than 2 trillion yuan worth of debt for equity swap deals have been signed by lenders  it added  though details of many of those arrangements have been murky  It has also banned consumer loans from being used illicitly to speculate on property to avoid fueling real estate bubbles  The CBIRC said shadow banking risks have now been contained  which will allow policymakers to better balance the need for stable economic growth this year while continuing to reduce financial risks  The IMF estimated in 2017 that China s total non financial sector debt would rise to almost 300 percent of its gross domestic product  GDP  by 2022  up from 242 percent in 2016   But hidden borrowing by Chinese local governments could be as high as 40 trillion yuan    amounting to  a debt iceberg with titanic credit risks   S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings said in a report late last year

116143,337658,SPGI,Rating appeal casts harsh light on Romania decision making,news,"By Marc Jones LONDON  Reuters    To its critics  Romania s bid to overturn an expected cut in the S P Global  NYSE SPGI  outlook on its prized investment grade rating suggests it rushed into major tax reforms without fully considering the impact on its reputation with markets  To its admirers  the appeal is a laudable initiative to avoid a downgrade that would be damaging to the country  Whatever the truth  an appeal against ratings rulings is a rarely tried tactic by governments these days  and experts say Romania s decision to take that path raises questions about how the government got itself into a predicament that could easily have been avoided  Romania lodged its appeal on the basis that its budget plans  which include controversial bank and energy sector taxes that have riled markets and could have a negative impact on its central bank  are still to be finalised  The prime minister s economic adviser and former finance minister  Darius Valcov  called it a  good move  to make the appeal which buys it two weeks of time  It certainly will be if it turns out to be one of the roughly 1 in 3 of issuers who succeed in their appeals   But it also raises questions about how things got this far  whether it could have been avoided and how much the picture can really change in S P s eyes in the next two weeks  European Union rules introduced back in 2014 mean that rating agencies now have to tell governments at the start of each year exactly when they will carry out their reviews   That means it is harder for finance ministries to claim relevant information has been ignored and is one of the main reasons why there have only been a handful of appeals in the last five years since the rules were brought in   If the decision is upheld  not only would the sovereign face a downgrade  but it would also be known publicly that it failed in its appeal   said S P s former head of sovereign ratings Moritz Kraemer  The last ones to have tried to appeal have been Liechtenstein  Cape Verde and Guernsey  S P says  Romania s situation is somewhat unusual though  It has been hounded for its tax plans which the government had said were intended to help improve living standards and lower borrowing costs   BORROWING COSTS Bucharest s stock market  heavy on banks and energy firms  plunged almost 20 percent though after their announcement in December and the European Central Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development both voiced their criticism  However  just days before S P s announcement was due and when the decision was already likely to have been made by its rating  committee   Romania s Finance Minister  Eugen Teodorovici  said publicly that there could be some key changes to tax plans  It may have been that possibility that saw S P accept the appeal which has given the government two weeks  breathing space  S P s presumed move would have been to cut the country s outlook to negative from stable  While it is not a full downgrade  Romania s position on the bottom rung of investment grade leaves it vulnerable   Statistically  rating firms say 1 in 3 of the negative outlooks they apply end up turning into a downgrade and that can be painful  A 2016 World Bank study  found that being cut to  junk  by at least two of the major ratings agencies increases a country s short term borrowing costs by almost 200 basis points on average   A big portion of that move tends to happen with the first cut too  as big investment and mutual funds that only buy investment grade quality bonds tend to sell anything that is at getting close to being downgraded   In our view they  tax plans  should just be repealed completely   said the Franklin Templeton s Romania CEO Johan Meyer  who manages Fondul Proprietatea  a listed closed end fund which has stakes in many state owned firms

116144,337659,SPGI,Moody s Scolds New York City on Amazon  Then Gives It a Pat,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Last Friday afternoon  as U S  financial markets were winding down for the week  Moody s Investors Service pushed out an upgrade on New York City s  38 billion of general obligation bonds  Normally this would be a big deal for the  3 8 trillion U S  municipal bond market  After all  it s one of the largest borrowers in an otherwise highly diffuse market comprising villages  towns  local park districts and school systems 
Yet in some ways  this Moody s upgrade was a surprise  As recently as December  the company s outlook on New York s Aa2 rating was stable  generally an indication that analysts are comfortable with its current rank  in this case  the third highest investment grade   The outlook never moved to positive  1  The new Aa1 grade is one step higher than S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings and Fitch Ratings  which kept theirs at AA  the equivalent of Moody s previous score  
But perhaps the most jarring detail is just two weeks earlier  Moody s practically dressed down New York for driving away Amazon com Inc  and its promise of 25 000 jobs at a new corporate campus in Queens  Here s a passage from a report originally published on Feb  15 about Amazon s decision 
 The announcement is credit negative for New York City and highlights how politics and anti business sentiment can combine to derail economic development despite competitive strengths  New York City has advantages in an educated workforce and mass transit that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  was seeking  and Amazon s investment would have accelerated growth in those areas  High tech employment will also grow more slowly without the 25 000 new jobs Amazon s arrival was expected to create  
As far as credit rating language goes  that s pretty harsh  Nicholas Samuels  the lead analyst  did go on to say that the city s economy will be strong  even without Amazon  citing companies like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   that have expanded  Amazon or not  the diversification away from Wall Street appeared to be the driving force behind the upgrade  Here s the first paragraph explaining it 
 The upgrade to the general obligation rating reflects continued strengthening and diversification of New York City s economy  reducing its reliance on volatile financial services  The city s competitive advantages include a young and highly skilled labor pool  access to higher education and medical centers  strong domestic and international transportation links  and low crime rates  Those fundamentals position New York City for strong future growth  especially in media  medical research  and technology  while maintaining its deep strength in financial services  
That may all be true  but it s nevertheless a puzzling timeline  It could be that New York had done enough to earn an upgrade before Amazon s mid February decision  and Moody s decided the loss of HQ2 wasn t enough to change that  Moody s cites the growth in technology jobs  noting that the city s population is  attractive to companies like Amazon  Facebook  Google  and others   At the end of that same paragraph  it mentions political opposition to Amazon  may make firms that want government incentives think twice about it as a location  However  the trajectory of the fundamentals that attracted Amazon in the first place are unchanged  
To be sure  a  credit negative  just reflects the directional impact of a distinct event  which often isn t enough to shift an entire outlook  Joe Mielenhausen  a Moody s spokesman  told Bloomberg News s Martin Z  Braun that the firm upgrades issuers from a stable outlook  all the time   even without some sort of new financial information  like audited financials or a surprise increase in tax revenue   In this instance  the upgrade was a culmination of various credit positive trends our team has been observing for some time   he said  It s mostly semantics  but that sounds deserving of a positive outlook to me 
Mayor Bill de Blasio  predictably  lauded the move  saying that New York s current rating is the highest ever from Moody s   For the last five years  we ve used the city s budget to improve the lives of New Yorkers   he said in a statement   Moody s credit rating is validation of what we ve always known  that you can be both a progressive and a strong fiscal manager  
Investors are already clamoring for the city s bonds  Yield spreads reached an all time low last week  fueled by demand for triple tax exempt debt as a shelter from the new federal limit on state and local tax deductions  In a block trade of at least  5 million on Monday  some New York bonds maturing in 2024 changed hands at a yield just 11 basis points above top rated munis  the smallest spread in 10 months  That s welcome news for New York taxpayers as the city prepares to issue about  1 billion of debt this week 
On top of it all  it s anyone s guess if the city s Amazon saga is even over  Governor Andrew Cuomo said he s had many conversations with the company and hopes they reconsider  The New York Times reported that he s gone so far as to connect with Jeff Bezos to make a personal pitch over the past two weeks  An open letter that ran as a full page ad in the newspaper urged a second chance 
Confronted with  anti business sentiment  and derailed economic development  Moody s ended up deciding Amazon wasn t a big loss  New York is strong enough as is  Armed with an even better credit rating and record low borrowing costs  it may only get stronger 
 1  It s true that upgrades from a stable outlook have happened before  Moody s pointed to five such examples in 2018  San Francisco Florida Chicago Public Schools Washington  D C   and the Great Lakes Water Authority ",2019-03-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/moodys-scoldsnew-york-city-on-amazon-then-gives-it-a-pat-1797808,1797808

on Wall Street  The lingering U S  trade issues and highly disappointing manufacturing activity are painting a lackluster picture as well  In addition  September s low consumer confidence level hasn t helped either In such a scenario  mutual funds that invest in sectors such as utilities could expect to gain from the sector s strength and decent growth  Investing in the utilities sector at this juncture seems prudent Utility Among S P 500 s Top Gaining Sectors YTDUtility has been one of top three gaining sectors of the S P 500 Index on a year to date basis  despite the ongoing issues that are rattling Wall Street  In fact  the U S  China trade war and global economic slowdown have been concerning investors since last year and affected other vulnerable sectors But utility has remained strong  The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU  increased 20 4  on a year to date basis  behind only Technology and Real Estate which rose 26 3  and 25   respectively A major reason to invest in utility companies in current market conditions is that these are resilient to economic cycles and therefore don t witness a deterioration in demand  Their large scale operations and steady balance sheets point toward steady business Secondly  since most utility companies operate under the protection of government regulations  these are shielded from new entrants in the market  Thus  these can establish themselves as a dominant entity for steady operations in a particular region Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  selected four mutual funds that invest in utility companies  All of these funds carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy   Moreover  these funds have encouraging year to date returns  Additionally  the minimum initial investment is within  5 000 We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund The question here is  why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds  read more    Fidelity Select

The rating company lowered the country by one notch to Ba1  one level below investment grade  with a negative outlook  Moody s forecasts Oman s fiscal deficit will remain high  ranging from 7 percent to 11 percent of gross domestic product in the next three years 
The downgrade reflects Moody s view  that prospects for new meaningful fiscal reforms are limited  to a greater extent than the rating agency had previously assessed   according to a statement   This view is underscored by delays of measures that were announced in early 2018 and that Moody s expected would be implemented during 2018 19

116152,337667,SPGI,Worried about next downturn  U S  credit funds may offer early clues,news,"By David Henry NEW YORK  Reuters    It seemed like an opportunity a lender would not want to miss  The loan paid 10 25 percent interest which would go up if a benchmark rose  The borrower was Trident USA Health Services  a growing company which provided bedside medical testing in nursing and assisted living centers  Trident was buying similar companies across the country targeting cost savings from consolidation  Trident filed for bankruptcy last month  It had taken on too much debt to cope with reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments  equipment upgrades and other issues  A new billing system for the expanded company failed and it never collected millions of dollars  Trident s lenders face estimated losses of 50 to 100 percent   We were wrong   Michael Mauer  chief executive of CM Finance Inc   O CMFN  one of the lenders  said in a Feb  7 call with stock analysts  After the Great Recession  regulators squeezed much of the risk out of U S  banks  But risk has not gone away  Much of it now resides in non bank financial entities  including commercial loan companies  such as CM Finance  private credit funds  and structured finance vehicles  many of which have yet to be tested by a broad recession after a nearly decade long expansion  The borrowers include mid sized  speculative grade companies that have loaded up on debt to fund their expansion  Sometimes one setback can push them over the edge  as happened with Trident s botched billing system roll out   We think credit losses will rise   said Matt Carroll  a credit analyst at S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings  His reasons  A lot of money has flowed into private credit  pushing down lending standards in a benign economy  Some  900 billion in non bank loans to mid sized companies sit alongside another  1 1 trillion of speculative grade loans that have been made by bank syndicates to larger companies and mostly resold to institutional investors  These amounts are dwarfed by the  11 trillion in outstanding U S  home mortgage loans and probably are not enough to drag down the financial system  as mortgages did during the 2007 2009 crisis  However  rising non bank debt has fueled concerns it could make a recession worse because loan losses could cripple many non bank lenders  leaving companies most in need without access to credit   When you have a real recession  the lender will not be there  So  a lot of these borrowers will be stranded   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  chief Jamie Dimon told analysts in January  SPECIAL STATUS The publicly listed funds that lent to Trident are among several dozen known as business development companies  BDCassets have quadrupled since the crisis to  100 billion  according to data from  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysts   Graphic    Those funds attracted investors by offering yields topping 10 percent because they were making loans that were riskier than those banks were allowed to make  BDCs hold special status under a 1980s federal law designed to support small business  The law limits their leverage  They are allowed to bypass taxes by paying out 90 percent of profits to shareholders  Unlike most non bank lenders  business development corporations must disclose estimated values for each loan and say which ones are going bad  Their reports give analysts looking for signs of trouble in commercial lending a glimpse into a bigger pool of an estimated additional  800 billion in unlisted funds and private accounts managed by many of the same firms   You can learn a lot by looking at the BDCs for what they might mean for other private credit   said Carroll of S P Global Ratings   In 2013  for example  one such investor called  THL Credit Inc   O TCRD  made loans  starting at 9 percent  for Charming Charlie  a retailer of women s fashion accessories arranged by color in as many as 26 different hues  The founder used the loans to buy shares of the business from a private equity firm and add more stores  according to S P Global  But the company went too far in stocking the stores with items of different colors and got stuck with unsold merchandise  Constrained by its debt  the company ran short of cash to properly stock the stores and filed for bankruptcy in December 2017  THL declined to comment for this story  but in a March 7 call its executives told investors they have diversified their portfolio to include 42 companies and reduce the risk of losses like those on Charming Charlie   These days some BDCs are doing better than others  Six of 39 BDCs tracked by Keefe  Bruyette   Woods recently traded at premiums of more than 10 percent to net asset value  a sign of good lending records  Eight  however  traded for less than 75 cents for each dollar of net asset value   suggesting they had enough problems with loans to make investors doubt the values shown will hold up  As BDCs doubled in size since 2013  Refinitiv data shows levels of debt relative to profits have risen to 4 75 times from 4 2 times for mid sized companies that borrowed to finance buyouts  according to Refinitiv data  That  combined with some lenders willingness to dial up the risk to boost returns  could spell more trouble ahead   It has become harder for BDCs to deliver compelling returns without taking more risk   Finian O Shea  a BDC analyst at Wells Fargo  said   
CM Finance  for example  in the last half of 2018 acquired loans coming due within two years and issued by low rated Techniplas  a supplier of highly engineered plastic parts to the auto industry  The appeal of the loans  A 14 percent yield  Yet  last month Standard   Poor s put a negative outlook on the loans because of the risk that company will not be able to refinance them in time ",2019-03-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/worried-about-next-downturn-us-credit-funds-may-offer-early-clues-1804438,1804438

116156,337671,SPGI,China Will Fall Short of Ambitious Tax Cut Target  S P Says,news," Bloomberg     China will fall well short of its target of cutting taxes and fees by a record 2 trillion yuan   298 billion  this year  according to S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings 
The government will likely only be able to cut taxes by 1 5 trillion yuan  about 25 percent short of its goal  S P credit analysts led by Yutong Zou wrote in a note on Monday  That s because while they government has cut companies  contributions to the social security fund  authorities will be stepping up enforcement  they wrote 
 We expect that China s tax cuts in 2019 will not be as deep as headline figures suggest   the analysts wrote in a release accompanying the report   Nevertheless  they will be deep enough to put some pressure on official budget spending to make up for lost revenue  
The government has vowed to reduce spending  issue more local government bonds and require more profit transfers from state owned banks and enterprises  State owned companies may contribute about 100 billion yuan more  assuming a 5 percent increase in their dividend payment  and the special bond issuance will largely be directed to investment projects instead of budgetary funding  the economists wrote 
To meet the goals  they estimate the government needs to reduce its expenditure by 680 billion yuan  squeezing its capabilities to build more infrastructure 
The budget deficit is only projected to increase by 380 billion yuan  and officials will be reluctant to use too much of the reserve funds because that pile is shrinking  the S P analysts wrote  Growth in revenue from land sales will decelerate due to a cooling of the property market  bringing in only about 200 billion yuan more  they said

couple of better than anticipated economic data  Buoyed by a resilient labor market and solid income gains  consumers remain the primary source of firepower for economic growth Small caps  being U S

116205,337720,SPGI,Cry For Argentina,opinion,"Argentina s primary election on Sunday  August 11  surprised everyone and shocked markets as the current president  Mauricio Macri  was defeated by 15 6 percentage points by the left wing Peronist candidate  Alberto Fernandez  Macri now appears to have only a very slim chance to win the October 27 presidential election  His tough austerity measures  which were needed because of the serious state of the country s economy and finances  have not been successful and have proved to be very unpopular   
Markets reacted strongly early last week  with stocks  bonds and the peso tumbling  At the end of the day on Monday  August 12  the main Argentina stock index  Merval  closed down 31  and Argentine sovereign bonds were down by 15 to 20 points  During the week  Fitch cut the sovereign bond rating by three notches to CCC and S P Global  NYSE SPGI  cut its rating on notch to B  with outlook negative  At the end of the week the 10 year bond rate was 25 14    calculated from the yields of other available durations  One month ago the rate was 24 5    The peso was down 15  after having initially swooned 30   There has been some  though still modest  contagion spreading to other emerging market sovereign credit markets  Argentina accounts for 5 5  of the Bloomberg  Barclays   EM US Dollar Sovereign Index  
Investors are clearly fearful of economic policies taking a left turn at a time when the economy is in recession  Growth declined 2 5  last year and 5 8  in the first quarter of 2019  Argentine inflation is among the world s highest  registering 22  for the first half of the year   
Alberto Fernandez was declared a candidate in May by the former president  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  who declared herself as the candidate for vice president  Kirchner s period as leader was marked by heavy handed government intervention in the economy and ill conceived currency controls and government subsidies  Fernandez has not provided any details of his economic policies  He is strongly critical of Macri s austerity policies  but he has indicated he will be more pragmatic and moderate than Kirchner was  
Macri  seeking to close the shortfall in his popularity  looks likely to move to the left  easing the austerity imposed as part of the country s agreement last year with the International Monetary Fund for a  50 billion  preventive credit line   He already has announced income tax cuts  increases in welfare subsides  a second increase this year in the minimum wage  and a 90 day freeze on gasoline prices  His economy minister Nicolas Dujovne has now resigned  saying the economic team needed  significant renewal  
Investors  concerns about these developments are well founded  Argentina s ability to meet its financing needs is at risk as investors appear increasingly hesitant to buy the nation s bonds  Interest rates on seven day notes were increased from 63  to 74  after the election  The country may need to ask the IMF to bring forward scheduled 2020 disbursements of its credit line 
The currency looks likely to remain under pressure  Macri s presidency  which began in 2015  has already witnessed two other steep falls in the peso  one of 30  when Macri ended currency controls and one of 25  last year  These devaluations have serious effects on domestic businesses  for which most costs are dollar based  And consumers are hit by a crippling increase in inflation 
The Global X MSCI Argentina ETF   NYSE ARGT   declined 24  on Monday August 12  and a further 4  on Tuesday  The markets for Argentine assets stabilized mid week after speeches by both presidential candidates  ARGT ended down 24 4  for the week  These developments are a good example of how individual emerging market economies can experience significant unanticipated risks  Emerging markets are currently experiencing high volatility and are under pressure from slowing global markets  trade wars  and a strengthening US dollar  At Cumberland Advisors we do not hold ARGT in our International or Global ETF Portfolios and have reduced our emerging market holdings ",2019-08-19,Bill Witherell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cry-for-argentina-200456458,200456458

116214,337729,SPGI,Shutdown Seen Having Minor Economic Impact  Releases Delayed,news," Bloomberg     The U S  economy won t be hurt much by a possible federal shutdown as long as it s brief and doesn t weigh on business and consumer confidence  some analysts are saying  though government reports on housing and trade next week would be postponed 
In a Friday morning Twitter post  President Donald Trump warned of a lengthy partial government shutdown if Democrats don t back a stopgap spending measure that includes money to build a wall along the U S  Mexico border 
The Census Bureau earlier this week said it will delay all data releases if the government shuts down at the end of the day Friday  The Census schedule includes a report on new home sales Dec  27  the advance goods trade balance and inventories on Dec  28 and construction spending Jan  3  Other agencies including the Federal Reserve and Labor Department will be issuing reports as scheduled 
Here s what some economists are saying about the possible economic impact 
Tim Mahedy  Bloomberg Economics
 The direct economic impact from a government shutdown  especially a partial shutdown  is minimal  However  the recent spike in political uncertainty  and the administration s comments that this shutdown could last for awhile  are a risk to both business and consumer sentiment if current conditions persist  
S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings
 Global economists estimate that a selective shutdown would have a modest  if not muted  impact on the  19 trillion economy in real terms  Our earlier analysis said that a full government shutdown could shave approximately 0 2 percentage points   6 5 billion  off of real GDP in the quarter for each week it drags on  
William Foster  Moody s
 A brief shutdown of the U S  government due to a budget impasse would cause minimal disruption to the economy and would not have a material impact on the U S  s sovereign credit profile  In the unlikely case of a protracted shutdown  credit implications would vary by sector and Moody s would evaluate on a case by case basis  should such a scenario play out  
Mark Hamrick  Bankrate com
 A shutdown would further aggravate the frustration Americans already feel about the inability of their federal government to successfully achieve the most basic of functions  It would pile on after the president has repeatedly verbally trashed numerous departments and the fundamental missions of the federal government serving the American people  A shutdown would add  for many  further demoralizing injuries to insults  
Jim O Sullivan  High Frequency Economics
 A partial government shutdown  if it occurred  would disrupt the economic data schedule  but it would probably not have any significant impact on broad macro trends  that was the pattern in late 2013  when a shutdown lasted 16 days  There were also two very brief and inconsequential shutdowns earlier this year  in January and February    lasting three days  including the weekend  and less than a full day respectively  As was the case earlier this year  there is no debt default threat this time  
Omair Sharif  SocGen
 If the government shuts down  this would be a partial shutdown of nine agencies  Roughly 75 percent of the appropriations to fund a number of agencies has already passed both houses  so this is not a total shutdown  as in past years  The nine agencies impacted employ around 420 000  essential  employees  who would be forced to work without pay until the impasse is resolved  a big chunk of those workers are at the Department of Homeland Security   Another 380 000 government workers would also be furloughed  ",2018-12-21,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/shutdown-seen-having-minor-economicimpact-releases-delayed-1728892,1728892
116217,337732,SPGI,Here s Why Closing the Government Actually Costs Taxpayers Money,news," Bloomberg     Even though paychecks would stop going out to hundreds of thousands of workers  shutting down the federal government actually costs money    and the longer it goes on  the more it will cost 
Museums and parks can t collect entry fees or sell souvenirs  the Internal Revenue Service would collect less taxes  and it costs money for federal workers to mothball and restart operations  Plus hundreds of thousands of thousands of furloughed workers are likely  ultimately  to get back pay    for not working 
 The amount of money we are going to spend on furloughed workers who aren t going to do anything but will get paid is pure waste   said Gordon Gray  director of fiscal policy at American Action Forum  which describes itself as a center right policy institute 
After the 16 day shutdown in 2013  Congress authorized an estimated  2 5 billion in back pay and other compensation for as many as 850 000 furloughed workers  according to an Office of Management and Budget report  The event also cost the government  7 million in revenue lost from entrance fees at national parks and a halt to IRS enforcement collections that averaged  1 billion a week 
 Diminished staffing levels lead to diminished government services   said Gray   Museums are closed  so the government doesn t sell freeze dried ice cream  
In contrast to 2013  three quarters of the government  including the Department of Defense Department of Labor and Department of Health and Human Services  have already been funded and won t be affected by a shutdown    limiting the impact  Nevertheless  about 350 000 other workers would be sent home  Federal grants  loans and purchases would also cease for the areas of the government affected 
About 400 000  essential  employees like border guards and airport screeners would continue to work without pay  Some operations would continue with prior year funding  such as the Smithsonian museums that will stay open through Jan  1 
President Donald Trump warned Friday of a  very long shutdown  if Senate Democrats refuse to back a government funding bill that includes billions to build a wall along the U S  Mexico border  The partial shutdown is into its third day  and could continue into the new year 
A prolonged shutdown could impact the broader economy  experts say 
 A week or longer will mean that businesses that depend on these federal employees will start to lose sales   said Stan Collender  a longtime congressional budget aide who s now editor in chief of thebudgetguy blog in Washington   Everything from groceries to cars will be affected  
Government services that will grind to a halt have costs too 
During the 2013 shutdown  U S  liquor sat at ports awaiting export certificates  and the Alaskan king crab fishing season  already short  was delayed because the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hadn t apportioned harvest levels and issued permits

116231,337746,SPGI,Factbox  What can the state of California do about PG E ,news," Reuters    California utility PG E Corp  N PCG  is exploring filing some or all of its business for bankruptcy protection as it could face billions of dollars in potential liabilities if it is held responsible for fatal wildfires in 2018 and 2017  people familiar with the matter have told Reuters  Trouble for PG E also means trouble for California  which relies on PG E to provide power to 5 4 million customers and make the investments necessary to shore up its system of wires and poles and mitigate the risk of future fires  PG E is also a key player in helping California meet its ambitious climate goals  Here are a few of the options California could consider to shore up the utility  A DO OVER OF LAST YEAR S WILDFIRE LEGISLATION California policymakers could extend assistance provided in a bill passed last year that allows utilities to raise rates to recover some of the costs related to wildfires  The law mitigates liability from fires in 2017 and others starting in 2019  but made no provision for fires last year  The move would give PG E an outlet for recovering billions of dollars in potential liabilities from last year s fires  but might not be enough to assuage deep investor concerns about its long term financial health given the increasing regularity of catastrophic fires  Insurance claims from the Camp Fire that erupted on Nov  8 in PG E s service territory have topped  7 billion and are expected to grow   I don t know that that would be enough to put the company in capital markets access  which is where they need to be   said Michael Wara  a scholar focused on climate and energy policy at Stanford Law School  It also may be a challenge politically  particularly since public and legislative sentiment has soured since the California Public Utilities Commission  CPUC  said last month it is considering penalties against PG E for falsifying safety documents for natural gas pipelines   I am not interested in another piece of legislation that allows them to pass cost off to the ratepayers for these liabilities   Assemblyman James Gallagher said in an interview on Saturday   We need a much bigger shake up and reform   Ratepayers are already bracing for higher rates due to the increased risks from wildfires  PG E last month asked the CPUC for a  1 1 billion rate increase  more than half of which would be for wildfire prevention and risk reduction  The CPUC could possibly interpret last year s law to include 2018  or new legislation could be passed  A legislative solution would likely be faster  Asked about PG E s fate at a news conference on Tuesday  California s new governor  Gavin Newsom  said   I m not going to make news on that   But he said he d had a meeting on the subject at 8 00 a m   State lawmakers said they are leery of responding to PG E s bankruptcy threat too quickly  saying they have lost their trust in the company   I don t know if I can trust this information   State Sen  Bill Dodd said in an interview   It s really too bad that their credibility has been shattered so gravely  That just puts us and the legislature in a position where we are going to take the time that s necessary to do this and to do it right    DIRECT SUPPORT California could intervene directly by providing credit support for future debt financings or municipalizing all or some utility assets   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analyst Stephen Byrd said  If the utility became state owned  California would assume all future wildfire risk  Byrd wrote in a client note last week  One scenario would be that the state takes over ownership of all of the electric distribution business and leaves the remaining businesses with shareholders  Byrd said this was the most bullish scenario for shareholders but added that it was unlikely that California would insulate shareholders from future wildfire liability while also giving them full value of the non electric distribution businesses  State ownership would not necessarily result in better maintenance of the utility s distribution system  said Catherine Sandoval  a professor at Santa Clara Law School and former CPUC commissioner   If you change to municipal control without changing the underlying dynamics of the maintenance and operation of the utility and its transmission network  you haven t really solved the problem   Sandoval said   State support for debt financing would result in a lower impact on consumer bills because all future wildfire liabilities would be absorbed by the remaining equity rate base in PG E  This option would be less favorable for shareholders due to the threat of future fire liabilities  A perceived bailout of PG E is losing luster among legislators and regulators and is far from assured  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  said when it stripped the company of its investment grade rating late on Monday   Previously  we assumed that given California s robust renewable portfolio standards and the increasing risks of climate change  legislators and regulators would proactively work with the utility to preserve credit quality to achieve these goals   S P Global analysts said in a note   However  based on recent developments  we no longer believe this to be true given the utility s own missteps   RESTRUCTURING VIA THE CPUC The CPUC last month said it was considering a range of options for addressing PG E s safety problems  including replacing some or all of its directors  splitting the utility s gas and electric divisions into separate companies  and reforming it into a publicly owned utility  Since then  PG E has said it is shaking up its board and reviewing its structure and corporate governance  but has not filed a specific plan with the CPUC  The CPUC did not return a request for comment   UTILITY FAIL California could allow PG E to go bankrupt  for the second time in its history   Under that scenario  shareholders would be the big losers  But California could benefit if the utility installs new management and can rebuild trust in Sacramento and on Wall Street  The state would also have time to consider how to reduce the risk from the cost of increasingly devastating wildfires over the long term    The fundamental problem is the utility at the current rate structure doesn t generate enough revenue to cover expenses  from catastrophic wildfires  Stanford s Wara said   The utility s management has gotten understandably very focused on the short term    The most important thing the state could do is slow things down  One way that happens is in bankruptcy   Though PG E can continue to operate in bankruptcy  ratepayers could still see higher bills  When PG E went bankrupt in 2001 amid the state s energy crisis  California customers had to pay higher bills for years to help repay  13 billion owed to creditors  Another bankruptcy today could potentially lump individual claims from wildfires in with Wall Street s claims  possibly ballooning the payout and leaving victims to compete with creditors  Dodd  the state senator  said on Monday that he would ask the state s Legislative Analyst s Office to assess the impact of a PG E bankruptcy on ratepayers and fire victims   I wouldn t be surprised if a PG E bankruptcy would lead to much higher rates for ratepayers and devastation for victims of previous wildfires   Dodd said   What we need to do is get some independent verification of what those numbers are and that will lead to a determination if legislation is necessary or not

116237,337752,SPGI,Global Consumer Staples ETF  KXI  Hits New 52 Week High,opinion,"For investors seeking momentum  iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF    is probably on radar  The fund just hit a 52 week high and is up about 22 7  from its 52 week low price of  44 30 share 
But are more gains in store for this ETF  Let s take a quick look at the fund and the near term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed 
KXI in Focus
The fund follows the S P Global  NYSE SPGI  1200 Consumer Staples Sector Capped Index  It holds about 90 securities in the portfolio  However  the fund has moderate company specific concentration risks with the top three holdings taking about 23   KXI is heavy on the United States and United Kingdom  The product charges 47 bps in fees  see here  
Why the Move 
The ECB and the Fed are mulling over possible stimulus measures this year  Easy money polices across the globe have resulted in lower interest rates and have gone a long way in boosting rate sensitive consumer staples stocks  Also  global growth worries and geopolitical tensions have contributed positively to the safe haven appeal of the sector 
Meanwhile  Eurozone consumer confidence recoiled in July thanks to   and declining unemployment   The U S  economy also reported solid growth in consumer spending in the second quarter  Both factors have acted in favor of consumer stocks 
More Gains Ahead 
If the ECB and the Fed come up with a market boosting message or rate cut announcement  there could be a rally in the fund

116238,337753,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Q2 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates,opinion,"S P Global  NYSE SPGI  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 43 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 25 per share  This compares to earnings of  2 17 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8   A quarter ago  it was expected that this independent ratings and analytics provider would post earnings of  2 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
S P Global  which belongs to the Zacks Business   Information Services industry  posted revenues of  1 70 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 20   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 61 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
S P Global shares have added about 44 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for S P Global 
While S P Global has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for S P Global was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 30 on  1 64 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  9 03 on  6 52 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Business   Information Services is currently in the top 27  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sampp-global-spgi-q2-earnings-and-revenues-surpass-estimates-200448896,200448896
116239,337754,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Is Up 1 84  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at S P Global  NYSE SPGI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  S P Global currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SPGI that show why this independent ratings and analytics provider shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For SPGI  shares are up 1 84  over the past week while the Zacks Business   Information Services industry is up 1 91  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 01  compares favorably with the industry s 1 65  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of S P Global have increased 20 69  over the past quarter  and have gained 30 38  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 1 53  and 7 04   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to SPGI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  SPGI is currently averaging 1 033 060 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with SPGI 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SPGI s consensus estimate  increasing from  9 01 to  9 06 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that SPGI is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep S P Global on your short list ",2019-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sampp-global-spgi-is-up-184-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200450051,200450051
116240,337755,SPGI,5 Things Every Investor Should Know Right Now,opinion,"Say what you will about last week  it certainly wasn t dull  The Federal Reserve  seemingly capitulating to President Donald Trump and Wall Street  became just the latest central bank to cut interest rates  Meanwhile  the president escalated the trade war even further  announcing that additional tariffs would be imposed on goods coming into the U S  from China after another round of trade talks failed to deliver a satisfactory resolution 

Oh  and gold closed out July with a fourth straight month of gains 

Read on for five things I believe every investor should know right now 

 1 August has a rocky history  Time to get defensive 

It s been a good year for stocks so far  with the S P 500 up about 19 percent as of the end of July  But here at the start of August  it may be time for investors to get cautious  if history is any indication  Since 1950  August has been the worst performing month  giving back 0 05 percent on average  according to LPL Research  It s also been the weakest month in the past 10 year and 20 year periods 





August wasn t always such a bummer  Between 1901 and 1951  the U S  harvesting season made it the best month for stocks  But now that only 2 percent of Americans work in agriculture  August has sunk to the very bottom 

More recently  incidental geopolitical and economic concerns have roiled markets in the eighth month  Think Iraq s invasion of Kuwait in 1990  Or the Asian contagion in 1997  Or the U S  debt downgrade in 2011 

The way things are shaping up  we could be in for another rocky August 

 2 The Fed capitulates  making the corporate debt bubble even more precarious 

I ve already shared some of my thoughts with you on last week s rate cut by the Fed  Lower  and potentially negative   real and nominal yields here in the U S  should spur investor demand for more reliable stores of value  such as gold  which I ll talk about in a moment 

Another consequence of rock bottom rates as we ve seen over the past decade since the end of the financial crisis is greater debt loads  Corporate debt is already at a historic high as a percent of U S  GDP  and it s feared that the Fed s move  coupled with the expectation of further cuts  could encourage even more risky borrowing  At the end of 2018  corporate debt stood at a whopping  5 7 trillion  two and a half times greater than the  2 2 trillion companies owed a decade earlier 





Even more concerning is the fact that the largest and fastest growing segment of investment grade debt is rated BBB which is just above junk status  In May  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  reported that the value of U S  BBB rated bonds exceeded  3 trillion for the first time ever  accounting for more than half of the entire investment grade bond universe 

In the event of an economic downturn  highly leveraged companies could risk seeing their debt downgraded to less than investment grade  making interest payments more expensive  Lenders that have participated in risky loans could therefore be particularly vulnerable 

And while I m on the topic of debt  the U S  Treasury announced last week that its issuance of long term debt would hold steady at a record  84 billion for the third consecutive quarter  This tops the previous record Treasury issuance  set in 2009  when the country was recovering from the worst economic pullback since the Great Depression  Borrowing by the U S  government is now on track to exceed  1 trillion for the second straight year  It s estimated that  by 2024  all U S  government debt issuance will be used only to pay interest on past debt 

 3 Trump s trade war is taking a huge toll on corporate earnings 

Last Thursday  President Trump announced via Twitter that the U S  would impose a 10 percent tariff on  300 billion of imports from China  effective September 1  This is on top of the 25 percent tariff that s already in place on  250 billion worth of Chinese made goods meaning nearly everything the U S  buys from its once top trading partner will now be taxed  and paid for by American importers and consumers  I should add  

I say  once top  because  as the Wall Street Journal reported Friday  China lost its spot as America s number one trading partner thanks to tensions between the two countries  In the first six months of 2019  imports from China fell 12 percent compared to the same period a year earlier  while exports fell 18 percent  The total value of bilateral trade  at nearly  290 billion  dropped below that of both Canada and Mexico for the first time in more than a decade 

As you might imagine  this is having a noticeably negative impact on earnings of U S  based  multinational companies  According to FactSet  firms that generate more than half of their revenues overseas have seen their bottom line plunge as much as 13 6 percent quarter over quarter  That s compared to a 3 2 percent increase in earnings for companies with less global revenue exposure  and an average 2 6 percent decline for all S P 500 companies that have reported so far   




 

 4 Tariffs are also hurting manufacturing growth  both here and abroad 

U S  factories are having their worst start to the third quarter since the end of the financial crisis  The purchasing managers  index  PMI  posted a 50 4 in July  its lowest reading since September 2009 despite being slightly higher than earlier forecasts  Employment contracted for only the second time in about 10 years  suggesting  the goods producing sector is on course to act as a significant drag on the economy in the third quarter   writes Chris Williamson  chief business economist at IHS Market 

The Chicago Business Barometer  often seen as a bellwether of the U S  economy  fell further below the neutral 50 0 level in July  The indicator touched 44 4  down from 49 7 the previous month  with production falling 22 percent to hit a 10 year low  Some factories are holding tariffs directly responsible for the slowdown  according to the monthly report 





The downturn isn t confined to the U S   of course  The Global Manufacturing PMI continued to contract for the third consecutive month in July  falling to 49 3  its lowest reading since October 2012 

 5 Gold demand just had its best first half of the year in three years 

Given the considerable risks right now  is it any wonder that gold has performed so well this year  As I write this  the yellow metal is trading above  1 475  up 12 6 percent from the start of January 

Gold demand in the first half of 2019 was its best in three years  climbing to 2 181 7 tonnes  largely due to increased appetite for gold backed ETFs as well as record buying by central banks  Bank purchases of bullion rose an incredible 47 percent year over year in the second quarter  pushing the total amount for the January to June period to its highest since central banks became net buyers of gold in 2010  Poland was the top buyer ahead of Russia  even with reserves growing 77 percent to 100 tonnes 





Meanwhile  investors added some 67 2 tonnes to their holdings of gold backed ETFs in the second quarter  This took total holdings to a six year high of 2 548 tonnes  Among the factors driving demand were geopolitical uncertainty  global negative yields and a rising gold price ",2019-08-05,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-every-investor-should-know-right-now-200450946,200450946

116261,337776,SPGI,Chicago mayor pushes bond sale  constitutional change to aid pensions,news,By Karen Pierog CHICAGO  Reuters    Mayor Rahm Emanuel laid out a multi pronged plan on Wednesday to tackle Chicago s huge pension burden  urging the city council to approve the issuance of  10 billion of bonds to boost funding for the city s four retirement systems   Emanuel  who leaves office in May after declining to run for a third term as mayor  also called for changing the Illinois Constitution and earmarking new revenue from a possible casino and legalized marijuana for pensions   Issuing these bonds and depositing the proceeds directly into our pension funds would immediately increase the health of our pension funds to levels not seen in at least a decade before asking more of Chicago s hard pressed taxpayers   the mayor said in a speech to the city council  Chicago s big unfunded pension liability  which stood at  27 6 billion in 2017  along with years of structural budget deficits  led to downgrades of the city s general obligation credit ratings and higher borrowing costs  Even after raising fees and taxes in recent years to save the retirement funds from becoming insolvent  the third largest U S  city faces pension contributions that will grow to  2 13 billion in 2023 from  1 02 billion this year  With the bond proceeds  the retirement systems  low funded ratio of just 26 percent would jump to 50 percent  while city contributions to the funds would decline  saving taxpayers nearly  7 billion over 50 years  Emanuel said  Emanuel introduced an ordinance to securitize state collected revenue due the city  including income taxes  to back  7 7 billion of the debt  which would be issued through a new Dedicated Tax Securitization Corporation  Chicago has already employed a similar bond structure to refund low rated outstanding debt through a securitization of sales tax revenue with a statutory lien for investors that resulted in higher credit ratings and lower borrowing costs  The remaining  2 3 billion of bonds would be backed by a water and sewer excise tax enacted in 2016 for the city s municipal retirement fund  An economic adviser to Emanuel first introduced the idea of the bond plan at a city investors  conference in August  However  the plan was put on hold earlier this fall in the wake of Emanuel s September decision not to run again and surging interest rates  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings in October cautioned the city that the move comes with risk and could have negative rating implications depending on how the bonds are structured and other factors  Emanuel said even higher taxes would pose a risk to Chicago s economy  while inaction on pensions risks more credit downgrades  He urged the 50 member council to act on the bonds  warning that interest rates are heading up and the market window for doing the deal will close  It was unclear if aldermen would move forward with the bond plan before a new mayor takes office  Scott Waguespack  chairman of the city council s progressive reform caucus  said the plan should be  vetted when the next mayor comes into office   One of the 21 candidates vying for mayor  Paul Vallas  a former Chicago budget director  said on Wednesday the bond plan  is just kicking the can down the road   There was immediate pushback from labor unions against Emanuel s proposal to amend protections for public worker retirement benefits in the Illinois Constitution to lower a costly 3 percent annual compounded cost of living adjustment given to city retirees  Leaders of the Chicago Federation of Labor and the Illinois AFL CIO issued a joint statement that said   Those pushing to repeal the Illinois Constitution s pension clause ignore the real problem  which is not the cost of benefits but the decades long habitual failure of politicians to pay the employer s share   Citing the clause  the Illinois Supreme Court rejected past attempts by the state and the city to reduce retirement benefits  The Democratic controlled Illinois General Assembly would have to approve the placement of an amendment on an upcoming state wide ballot  as well as pass bills authorizing a Chicago casino and legalizing marijuana to complete Emanuel s proposal ,2018-12-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chicago-mayor-pushes-bond-sale-constitutional-change-to-aid-pensions-1719883,1719883
116262,337777,SPGI,Bond vigilantes reckon their job is done in Italy,news,By Sujata Rao  Reuters    It s been the stormiest year for Italian bond markets since the 2011 euro zone crisis  but as 2018 ends  investors who fled mid year are returning and their worst fears    euro exit  junk ratings and reckless spending    have proved unfounded  Often described as bond vigilantes for the way they impose fiscal discipline on profligate governments  debt investors punished Italy hard for proposing a draft budget deficit three times higher than it had pledged  Sovereign borrowing costs surged to five year highs  That creditor strike appears to have achieved its aim  Government bond yields  already down a fifth from the highs  lurched lower again this week after the conviction grew that a budget row with the European Commission would blow over without Rome incurring significant penalties  That optimism is fed above all by Rome s decision to trim its 2019 deficit targets  after months of acrimony  With France moving this week to widen its own budget deficit  the EU is likely to accept Italy s new suggestion   We thought of this as an entry point   said Tim Graf  chief macro strategist at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Advisors   You are getting relatively good yields  and if you have greater willingness on part of the EU to accommodate more expansionary budgets  from that perspective a 3 percent euro denominated yield for 10 years looks phenomenal   Italian 10 year yields slipped just below that level on Thursday  while its yield premium over Germany    effectively a measure of a euro credit s riskiness    has snapped in more than half a percentage point from peaks   For a graphic on  Italian German 10 year bond yield gap this year  click   With France s deficit now possibly approaching 3 5 percent of GDP  Italy unsurprisingly wants equal treatment  Some investors also accept that Rome needs to galvanize its moribund economy   Italy is not doing something system destroying  it s not like they want a 5 to 6 percent deficit  The European Commission has to accept their need for growth   said Salman Ahmed  global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers  Ahmed s Italy position until recently was  100 percent negative   But heading into 2019  he has changed that to neutral  betting the Italy Germany spread peaked a while back  Foreigners sold 69 billion euros of government bonds between May and September  but after a 3 percent drop in foreign holdings in April June  the biggest quarterly fall since 2012  selling slowed in the third quarter  the central bank said  September outflows were 1 5 billion euros versus August s 17 4 billion euros   For a graphic on  Euro zone bond market performance in 2018  click   SHORT TERM  Of course  Italy isn t out of trouble yet  a populist government remains in place  an EU penalty is still likely and with a weak economy  its 2 3 trillion euro government debt saddles it with one of the world s worst debt ratios  1 3 times annual output  Debt issues will therefore certainly come back to haunt it  But this year at least  the worst fears have not materialised  Above all  says Arnaud Guilhem Lamy  a portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Asset Management  one huge risk    future redenomination of Italy s debt into lira    has receded for now  Lamy noted that gauges of euro breakup risk  which flashed bright at the height of the turmoil  have subsided  helped by a softer tone on the euro from firebrand Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini   A lot is already priced in  The market is not long  on Italian debt  as it was in May  it is neutral or short  so you won t get panic selling  So there is a positive dynamic from a technical point of view   said Lamy  He has a small underweight on Italy but likes short dated two year debt because  the carry is attractive and we don t expect them to leave the euro zone in this period   Two year Italian securities yield 0 48 percent  IT2YT RR  versus minus 0 17 percent in Spain  ES2YT RR   rated two notches higher by S P at A   Mark Haefele  chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management  also said he had added to holdings of two year debt  Most big investors are keen on short dated bonds  which are less vulnerable to euro break up risk and the possibility of a credit rating downgrade to junk  Italy has hung on to its investment grade rating  which guarantees its place in IG only bond indexes  Relegation to  junk  would have ejected it from these benchmarks  triggering billions of euros in forced selling  But S P Global  NYSE SPGI  and Fitch keep Italy at BBB  two notches above junk  Moody s did cut to Baa3 in October  a rung above junk  but attached a  stable  outlook  meaning investment grade status is not immediately threatened  ECB HAND Rome needs investors on its side  It needs to raise 400 billion euros in 2019 for debt repayments and spending  But even though the European Central Bank s bond purchases will have ended  Italy will benefit from its reinvestment program    BNP Paribas AM notes the ECB will buy 35 billion euros of Italian debt in 2019  not much below this year s 50 billion euros   Expectation is also building of more ECB stimulus  probably via cheap multi year loans to banks    some of which could leak into Italian bonds   I take the ECB at its word that if it can see a little willingness of the Italian government to look at deficit spending and try to control it  then they  the ECB  can solve the problems in the bond market   said Bob Michele  fixed income CIO at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Asset Management   I think things will work out OK   he said

116263,337778,SPGI,Deep in the red  Chinese county pays price for vanity project binge,news,"By Shu Zhang and Ryan Woo RUCHENG COUNTY  China  Reuters    In the heart of an impoverished village in southern China  a life sized statue of Mao Zedong sits on a platform adorned with intricate stonework  flanked by a diorama of Red Army soldiers and traditional brick and tile homes with curved roofs  Officials have spent a small fortune on the project that has transformed the village of Shazhou  in Hunan province  into an open air museum dedicated to the Chinese Communist Party  But few tourists have come to peer at the inscription at the foot of Mao s statue  or take selfies in front of the heroes of the revolution  The  red tourism  project was the brainchild of the former Communist Party chief of the local county  Rucheng  and cost 300 million yuan   44 million   But it has yet to produce a profit  just like the string of public gardens  town squares and office buildings that the county has built in recent years  Now the clock is ticking as Rucheng  among China s poorest counties  and with a population of just 420 400 people  is under pressure to resolve  1 billion in debt  following a decade of credit fuelled vanity projects  three local officials told Reuters  They requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter  To raise funds and conserve cash  Rucheng   which doesn t have a train station or an airport   has been slashing public investment in infrastructure projects and increasing government land sales to generate revenue  the officials said   Rucheng is not alone   hundreds of other indebted counties in China are in the same boat  In a recent financial stability report  the central bank said that much of China s hidden debt risk is held at lower tier levels  meaning prefectures and counties like Rucheng  As China prepares this month to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the economic reforms that transformed it into the world s second largest economy  fears over local government debt are growing  China s local governments had 18 4 trillion yuan of outstanding debt at the end of October  and were estimated by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings to have up to 40 trillion yuan in off budget borrowing  Of particular concern to the authorities as they tackle risks in the financial system are those governments with tiny revenue streams relative to their debt  Their over reliance on income from land sales is also driving asset bubbles in China  Rucheng s free spending ways came onto Beijing s radar this year when visiting anti corruption inspectors were shocked by the contrast between the county s newly built but deserted municipal district and cramped older areas where residents drink polluted water from aging pipes  When the inspectors were in town  numerous anonymous complaints arrived in the mail  Since 2008  Rucheng has spent billions on 10 office buildings  11 public gardens and squares and 26 urban roads  the anti corruption inspectors found  But less than 6 percent of government spending went on investing in industry  Vanity investments helped drive Rucheng s debt ratio   or borrowing relative to fiscal revenue   to 336 percent last year from 286 percent in 2016  and 274 percent in 2015   We must rectify the problem according to what is required of us  otherwise the local people will not trust our government officials anymore   said one of the officials  The head of Rucheng s Communist Party was sacked for profligate spending and  ignoring the livelihood of the local people   Hunan province also placed Rucheng on a  top level government debt warning list  of counties with debt ratios over 100 percent  the Rucheng officials said  Local governments on the list face restrictions on taking on new debt  launching new projects  hiring employees and traveling overseas  they said  RUCHENG CUTS BACK Since the anti corruption inspection  Rucheng has suspended  canceled and scaled back 79 government projects  cutting investment by 2 1 billion yuan  the officials said   All Rucheng officials have been working seven days a week and meeting regularly with local residents  the three officials said  One official died from overwork  they added  More than 30 million yuan is also being spent on renovating old water pipes in the area  To resolve the debt problem  Rucheng has to repay 400 million yuan a year in principle and interest to reduce its outstanding government debt  which was around 9 billion yuan at the end of 2017  an official at Rucheng s finance and debt department told Reuters  Rucheng s debt ratio has since dropped to about 60 6 percent  said the official at its finance department  On Dec  5  the provincial government lowered Rucheng s government debt warning level from  first level  to  second level   the officials said   At the same time  Rucheng officials are under pressure to produce economic growth   The higher authorities require us to have zero additional debt but deliver high quality economic growth   said a Rucheng official in charge of the economy  WASHING VEGETABLES  BOILING EGGS But the legacy of the vanity spending remains  A mineral bath tourism spot in Rucheng was deserted during a recent visit by Reuters  Local residents washing vegetables and boiling eggs in the hot springs said the tourism spot  which had cost about 400 million yuan to build  had done little to improve livelihoods  In nearby Shazhou  which has a population of 500  residents said they had been pressured to sell land at bargain prices to the government for the red tourism project while getting paid only 100 yuan a day as construction workers at the site  White elephant projects built by local governments proliferated across China after the central government pumped trillions of yuan into the economy during the 2008 2009 global financial crisis  Beijing has since tried to curtail direct borrowing by local governments for such projects  but officials have found ways around the curbs  One widespread method has been the establishment of shell companies known as local government financing vehicles to obtain funds for infrastructure and real estate projects  from which local officials often can profit  Rucheng had nine such financing vehicles until recently  said the Rucheng finance official  adding that the number had now been cut to two  More than 1 billion yuan in debt was disposed of in that restructuring  he said  Rucheng still has another 1 4 billion yuan of  mid  to long term payment obligations   which will take Rucheng 10 years to repay  the official said  Despite Rucheng s large debts  the officials said the county s 5 36 billion yuan in government bonds presented  no default risk  because they would keep issuing so called refinancing bonds to roll over the debt  WOBBLY ECONOMY The crackdown by Beijing in Rucheng was not only painful for local officials  but it also threatened a fragile local economy that is comprised of agriculture  green industries and eco tourism  Like other places in China  Rucheng needs to develop its private sector and new industries to counter a slowing regional economy at a time when government investment is severely constrained  the officials told Reuters  There are signs that some private capital is entering Rucheng  In September  the Dongguan Electronic Industry Association in Guangdong signed a 10 billion yuan investment plan to create an industrial park in Rucheng  attracted by cheaper land and labor costs  That would bring in at least 20 mid sized electronic firms and create 10 000 local jobs  Guo Peng  manager of the association  told Reuters  But for Rucheng officials  the fear of being punished for increasing government debt risks has extinguished much of their desire to chase higher economic growth  Rucheng indicated in August that its growth target for the region would be cut to 8 percent from 10 5 percent   We are not taking on any new debt illicitly for construction   said an official at the county s Communist Party   If a local administration raises debt in violation of central government policy  local officials will be held responsible for their entire life

116266,337781,SPGI,Builders bruised by Dubai s real estate market woes,news,"By Tuqa Khalid DUBAI  Reuters    Dubai s real estate downturn is forcing construction and engineering firms to cut jobs and halt expansion plans  in turn raising fresh risks for the wider economy  Known for its glittering skyscrapers and luxury villas  the Dubai property market is oversupplied  especially in the residential sector where prices have fallen steadily from a peak in mid 2014  Many towers stand half empty  and some construction sites have been left dormant    We stopped expansion   said Samer El Achkar  chief executive of Al Qabdah  which built the Kempinski Hotel on the man made Palm Jumeirah island  Al Qabdah culled 10 percent of its roughly 7 400 workforce in June   We are trying not to reduce our employees but when we complete or deliver a project we let go of some employees if we don t need them in other projects   El Achkar said   A diplomatic row with former ally Qatar and sanctions against Iran  a major trading partner  have curbed foreign demand for property  while a new value added tax has dragged on the domestic economy  A Reuters analysis of data from the Dubai Land Department  DLD  showed a 76 percent jump in the number of delayed developments and sales of villas and flats between 2016 and 2018  The DLD told Reuters that 865 developers were registered with the department in 2018 but that only one in four had projects currently active  BNC  which provides news and data on the construction industry  estimates the value of delayed projects at  126 3 billion in 2018  up from  107 6 billion in 2017 and equivalent to about 16 percent of all projects this year  The DLD declined to give  private data  on struggling projects  While real estate schemes

chief economic adviser at Dubai s department of economic development  told Reuters   Investments targeted at Expo 2020 and beyond have given a fillip to the construction sector that continues to exhibit healthy growth rates  while at the same time increased supply in the market is putting cyclical pressure on the real estate sector   Projects are often dogged by stalled payments from developers  long a headache for builders in the region but one that has become worse as banks have become reluctant to extend more credit to the sector   Krisjanis Krustins  a director in the Middle East and Africa team at Fitch Ratings  said he had  yet to hear a coherent thesis  for how Expo 2020 would sustain economic growth  ECONOMIC PLANK Real estate and construction together accounted for 13 3 percent of Dubai s gross domestic product in 2017  according to the Dubai Statistics Center  Slumping property companies and contractors have helped make Dubai s stock market the worst performing in the Middle East this year  down about 24 percent   The construction sector has traditionally been a key source of growth for the wider economy  so any pressure on the industry would inevitably have an impact on both the rate of headline GDP growth and on other sectors that benefit indirectly from strong construction activity   said Jean Paul Pigat  head of research at Lighthouse Research in Dubai   The current situation is not comparable to the crash of a decade ago  which saw property prices fall more than 50 percent between 2008 and 2010 as the global financial crisis unfolded  But the outlook is grim  After falling 5 10 percent in 2017  real estate prices could decline by 10 15 percent over the next two years  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings said earlier this year  That is affecting construction firms and related contractors said Bishoy Azmy  CEO of Dubai based Al Shafar General Contracting  ASGC    The reduction in the expectation of cost due to the pressure developers are facing and their own business model  means that contractors have to work at numbers that are even below their cost of a few months ago  or a few years ago   Azmy said   The entire margin of the construction industry now is not enough   The strain is visible at two of the Middle East s construction giants   Drake   Scull International  DU DSI   DSI   which has reported losses in eight of the

116271,337786,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"S P Global  NYSE SPGI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent ratings and analytics provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 25 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 64 billion  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 07  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for S P Global 
For S P Global  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that S P Global will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that S P Global would post earnings of  2 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
S P Global appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-global-spgi-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200445193,200445193

116296,337811,SPGI,China s Gas Boom Opens Free Market Cracks for Trucks and Tankers,news," Bloomberg     So you want in on China  the world s fastest growing gas market 
It would have been virtually impossible last decade  The only gas seen in China was pumped from its own wells and sold at prices strictly regulated by the government 
Today  things are vastly different as China has become the world s biggest importer  Its battle against smog by replacing coal furnaces caused demand for cleaner burning gas to explode  pushing up prices above state controlled rates 
Amid the surge in consumption and imports  new trading methods have emerged that reflect supply and demand in ways inconceivable under tight pricing controls that dominated the market  The government has also signaled a willingness to loosen its grip  pushing through policies in recent times that adopt more free market practices common in the U S  and Europe 
Here s a look at some of those initiatives 
Trucks
The future of gas trading in China may evolve from a decidedly primitive mode of transportation  good ol  trucks  Since the 1990s  China has super chilled small amounts of domestic gas into liquid form  loaded it on tanker trucks and sent the vehicles off to filling stations to fuel everything from taxis to 18 wheelers 
Those trucks have found a massive new market in recent years as China forced homes and factories to switch from burning coal  boosting gas demand quicker than pipelines can be built to support it  Trucks carried about 19 million tons of liquefied natural gas to customers last year  accounting for 12 percent of China s total use  Wood Mackenzie Ltd  estimates 
Click here to read about the  pipelines on wheels  market
All that trucked supply is sold outside the government s regulated pricing scheme  Buyers and sellers negotiate deals on WeChat and other platforms  Exchanges and companies such as ENN Group publish daily prices  adding transparency to this corner of the market 
Trucked LNG sells for about 4 500 yuan   650  a metric ton  That s two thirds higher than the government set benchmark Shanghai city gate rates  In the previous winter  trucked LNG prices jumped to 7 400 yuan amid a nationwide gas shortage 
Ships
If a truck of LNG is too small for your needs  consider an ocean going tanker  The first auction of overseas supply via a Chinese trading platform took place in September  according to the host Chongqing Petroleum   Gas Exchange  The buyer was a unit of China National Petroleum Co   which said spot cargoes traded over the bourse have a price advantage 
What the Chongqing exchange wants to achieve is an active gas marketplace where buyers and sellers can gain the price transparency and liquidity they need for trading  It follows in the footsteps of global companies such as S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts and GLX  which have created online platforms that allow traders to bid and offer spot cargoes  including shipments into China 
Terminals
What good is a ship full of LNG if there s no place to unload it  That problem was felt acutely last year  when infrastructure needed for China s transition from coal to gas wasn t completed in time  worsening heating shortages in parts of the country 
Most of China s gas facilities are owned and operated by its state owned giants  CNPC  Sinopec Group and China National Offshore Oil Corp  Over the years  authorities have urged the trio to share their terminals and pipelines with smaller firms to help ease bottlenecks in the distribution network 
In a first ever deal this year  CNOOC auctioned off a time slot for its Yuedong station to a Zhenhua Oil led consortium  allowing them to receive an import cargo during the designated period  It s since auctioned a second terminal spot on the Shanghai Petroleum   Natural Gas Exchange 
Some companies including ENN  Guanghui Energy Co  and Jovo Energy Co  have built their own terminals so they can access the global LNG market and not be beholden to other operators 
Auctions
The two exchanges in Shanghai and Chongqing have also started allowing companies to auction small quantities of gas and LNG on their platforms  Depending on demand  that will give firms the chance to fetch prices above government set rates  All three of China s largest gas suppliers have taken part in such auctions this year 
Policies
It s not just trading practices that have evolved  National policies have also undergone changes to free up the gas market  The government is considering spinning off pipeline assets of the three state giants into a separate national operator  allowing for fairer access and competition among companies  The plan may be unveiled in the first half of 2019 
Another policy shift is the convergence of China s residential and non residential benchmark rates to give markets greater flexibility to determine prices  The nation s top economic planner said in May that China sourced about 40 percent of its natural gas supplies from overseas last year  and domestic prices were insufficient to cover import or production costs ",2018-11-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/chinas-gas-boom-opens-free-market-cracks-for-trucks-and-tankers-1704208,1704208

116298,337813,SPGI,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love S P Global  SPGI ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at S P Global  NYSE SPGI   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  S P Global currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if SPGI is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this independent ratings and analytics provider holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For SPGI  shares are up 4 04  over the past week while the Zacks Business   Information Services industry is up 1 02  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 23  compares favorably with the industry s 2 78  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of S P Global have increased 9 78  over the past quarter  and have gained 13 14  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 4 31  and 10 21   respectively 
Investors should also take note of SPGI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  SPGI is averaging 931 888 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with SPGI 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost SPGI s consensus estimate  increasing from  9 01 to  9 03 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that SPGI is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep S P Global on your short list ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-sp-global-spgi-200439356,200439356

116313,337828,SPGI,Wind Power To Lift Alternative Energy Space In The Near Term,opinion,"The Zacks  industry can be fundamentally segregated into two sets of companies  While one group is involved in the generation and distribution of alternative energy and electricity from sources like wind  natural gas  biofuel  hydro and geothermal  the other set is engaged in development  design and installation of renewable projects involving these alternative energy sources 
The industry also includes a handful of stocks that offer fuel cell energy solutions  which have gained popularity as an affordable clean energy of late 
Per the latest Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report  2017 marked the eighth year in a row in which global investment in renewables exceeded  200 billion  Since 2004  the world has invested  2 9 trillion in green energy sources 
Here are the industry s three major themes Among alternative energy sources  wind energy has made commendable progress in the United States lately  Per American Wind Energy Association s latest report  the U S  wind industry added 7 588 megawatts  MW  in 2018 and another 841 MW in the first quarter of 2019  U S  wind power has more than tripled over the past decade and is the largest source of renewable generating capacity in the nation currently  With increased focus of energy developers on large scale off shore wind projects  the recent tax credit extension bills introduced by the U S  Senate should bode well for growth of the U S  wind space  With projections that wind power is slated to surpass hydropower as the U S  grid s largest source of renewable electricity in 2019  the outlook for the alternative energy industry seems favorable  The outlook for the alternative energy industry is also encouraging as utilities and corporations are increasingly shifting to renewables  This shift can be attributed to lower cost of generating electricity from alternative energy sources and storing the same  thanks to rapid technological advancements  Per International Renewable Energy Agency  cost of all commercially available renewable power generation technologies declined in 2018  By 2020  onshore wind is projected to be a less expensive source of new electricity than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative  This indicates that alternative energy sources can be profitable for industry players  Thus  stocks in this industry should remain prudent choices for investors  Per a report by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  with U S  states increasingly adopting favorable renewable portfolio standards  existing technologies are not adequate to support their ambitious 100  clean energy goals  In particular  the stakes are high when it comes to transmission costs  Per a report by Wood Mackenzie  the United States currently has about 200 000 miles of high voltage transmission  HVT  and achieving 100  renewables will require doubling of these transmission lines  The addition of 200 000 miles of new HVT will add  700 billion to the total price of grid decarbonization  excluding the cost of materials Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Prospects
The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  175  which places it in the bottom 31  of more than 250 Zacks industries 
The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates dull near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Before we present a few alternative energy stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture 
Industry Lags S P 500  Outperforms Sector
The Alternative Energy Industry has underperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite but outperformed its own sector over the past year  The industry has declined 8 1  while the Oils Energy Sector declined 14 2  in the said time frame  The S P 500 meanwhile has gained 6 6  
One Year Price Performance

 
Industry s Current Valuation
On the basis of trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio  which is commonly used for valuing alternative energy stocks  the industry is currently trading at 3 4 compared with the S P 500 s 11 29 and the sector s 4 94 
Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 6X  as low as 1 90X  and at the median of 3 92X  as the charts show below 
EV EBITDA Ratio  TTM 


 
Bottom Line
Thanks to rapidly declining costs of producing electricity from renewable sources of energy  particularly wind  renewables are likely to become a major source for electricity generation in the coming years  However  details on how to get the last 10 20  of carbon emissions out of the electric grid are not known certainly  
Moreover  fossil fuel combustion from residential and commercial buildings accounts for roughly 29  of total U S  greenhouse gas emissions  So  if the country is determined to build a cleaner environment  cutting down carbon emissions from energy use in buildings is necessary  While smart energy buildings are in vogue currently  reducing emissions from existing buildings remains a challenge 
Nevertheless  increased awareness about clean energy adoption should drive stocks in the U S  alternative energy space and help them to generate positive shareholder returns in the near future 
Now  let us bet on a few alternative energy stocks that boast a strong bottom line outlook  Here we present three alternative energy stocks with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that investors may want to invest in for the time being  You can see

The U K  bank is recommending that investors position for a further worsening of the relationship between populist leaders in Rome and the European Union by selling Italian bonds versus their Spanish peers  That s because both sides are likely to drive a hard bargain  driving volatility higher  before an agreement is found 
 In the long run  we are optimistic that a compromise will be found  but the path to get there may not be smooth   wrote Chris Attfield  a London based fixed income strategist at HSBC   If the EU takes a harder line to preserve its credibility  and that of the fiscal rules  it risks a confrontation  which could lead to sanctions  political tension and possibly a rise in Euroskeptic sentiment  
Italian bonds have held steady after S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings and Moody s Investors Service refrained from docking the nation to junk following the government s plans to widen the budget deficit next year  The EU has come down on the nation s leaders firmly  stating Thursday that their growth targets were overly ambitious and the fiscal shortfall would be wider than anticipated  putting it in breach of the bloc s rules 
HSBC recommends entering a widening trade between Italy s 2 8 percent bond maturing in Dec  2028 versus Spain s 1 4 percent bond due in July 2028  with the former offering 185 basis points more than the latter on Friday  Attfield expects the spread to widen to 210 basis points by the end of the year

116327,337842,SPGI,The Energy Report  Natural Gas Under Pressure,opinion,"We have a trade deal with Mexico  again  after Mexico promised the Trump Administration that it would expand border programs to slow migration into the U S  Now if we get a deal with China it will be risk on nirvana  In fact  even the late deal with Mexico juiced up markets last night but data from China seemed to dampen the mood a bit  Reuters reported  that China s exports unexpectedly returned to growth in May despite higher U S  tariffs  but imports fell the most in nearly three years in a further sign of weak domestic demand that could prompt Beijing to step up stimulus measures  
Some analysts suspected Chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the United States to avoid the new tariffs on  300 billion of goods that President Donald Trump is threatening to impose in a rapidly escalating trade dispute  But Monday s better than expected export data is unlikely to ease fears that a longer and costlier U S  China trade war may no longer be avoidable  pushing the global economy towards recession 
The U S  China trade war concerns are raising fears of subpar oil demand growth  Yet are those fears being overstated  especially because we have the Fed telling us that they are lowering interest rates  The ECB is also hinting about a rate cut  The Chinese for their part are going to fight a trade war with massive stimulus spending  China s May exports rose 1 1  from a year earlier  compared with market expectations for a modest decline  customs data showed 
You also have OPEC that is telling you that they are going to continue to restrain supply from the marketplace  According to the latest report from S P Global  NYSE SPGI  SPGI Platts  OPEC production fell to 30 09 million b d in May  the lowest since February 2015  before Gabon  Equatorial Guinea and Congo joined and when Qatar was still a member  Saudi Arabia s crude output fell to 9 70 million b d  lowest since January 2015  They also say that sanctions hit Iran produced 2 45 million b d  its lowest in almost 21 years  The cut was partly made up by Iraq whose production surged to an all time high of 4 82 million b d  Libya despite the potential for civil war  produced its most since June 2013

116330,337845,SPGI,5 Transportation Stocks To Gain From 5 Month Low Oil Prices,opinion,On Jun 12  oil prices plunged to their lowest levels since January  A substantial increase in U S  crude inventories was the immediate trigger for the day s losses  The quantum of decline was probably attributable to the fact that it has happened for the second week in a row even as the U S  China trade war continues with no quick end in sight Meanwhile  oil cartel OPEC and other major crude exporters are likely to meet sometime in the next few weeks to take a call on existing production controls  A further clampdown on production could boost prices But this is unlikely to have any long term impact  per Goldman Sachs   NYSE GS    since U S  production will increase further during the second half of 2019  Under such circumstances  it makes sense to add transportation stocks to your portfolio  since they will gain substantially from lower crude prices Spike in U S  Inventories Boosts PricesOn Wednesday  WTI crude slumped  2 13 or 4  to settle at  51 15 a barrel  This was the lowest settlement recorded since Jan 14  Also  Brent crude declined  2 32 or 3 7  to finish at  59 97 a barrel  This is Brent crude s first settlement below the  60 level since January The catalyst for these losses was a second straight increase in weekly crude inventories  Per the Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  crude inventories increased by 2 2 million barrels during the week ended Jun 7 For the week ended Jun 7  analysts at S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts had projected a moderate increase of 80 000 barrels  A Reuters poll had even predicted that supplies would decline by 481 000 barrels  On Jun 11  the American Petroleum Institute  API  had stated that U S  crude supplies had increased by 4 9 million barrels over this period Will Prices Stabilize After the OPEC Meet All eyes are now on a meeting of OPEC members and other major crude exporters  slated to be held in the next few weeks  Market watchers will subsequently learn whether the production bloc and its collaborators will extend production controls even further However  the investment bank thinks the exact timing of the meeting remains uncertain  This is because OPEC was initially considering a Jun 25 26 meet  per Bloomberg  while Russia is pressing for a Jul 3 4 timeline   At the same time  Goldman Sachs feels that OPEC will extend the duration of its production controls after such a meeting  The initiative is likely to be taken by key cartel members  such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates But the effect of such an extension will likely only be  modestly supportive   This is because oil prices will come under renewed pressure during the second half of the year  At this point  additional U S  infrastructure will become operational  leading to the availability of fresh crude supplies Our ChoicesA second straight increase in U S  crude stockpiles has led to yet another plunge in crude prices  The effect of this recurrent buildup is likely to last until OPEC acts to extend its production controls  raising price expectations  However  Goldman feels the impact of such actions will be temporary at best since additional U S  crude supplies are slated to come online in a few months Transportation will benefit from lasting low crude prices  This will not only result in cost savings for the sector  but also boost consumer spending  and in turn global trade  This is why it makes sense to invest in transportation stocks  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is

116332,337847,SPGI,Oil Extends Last Week s Sharp Retreat As Demand Worries Sour Sentiment,opinion,"Crude oil futures prices fell Monday  with investors digesting worrisome demand updates issued last week and keeping tabs on typically price supportive risks percolating in the Middle East 
Among the latest headlines  Iran will break the uranium stockpile limit set by Tehran s nuclear deal with world powers in the next 10 days  the spokesman for the country s atomic agency said Monday  according to the Associated Press 
This is  likely the latest political posturing from Iran to spark European countries in delivering some relief from the U S  sanctions that have crippled their economy   said Edward Moya  senior market analyst at Oanda   If Iran does abandon the nuclear pact over the next two weeks  that would raise the bar with tensions and the Middle East  
On Monday  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CLN19   1 05  fell 58 cents  or 1 1   to settle at  51 93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  following two consecutive session gains 
The attack on two tankers in the Middle East s Strait of Hormuz last week triggered concerns about disruptions to the global flow of oil and prompted a late week rally in prices  but the market failed to recoup the 4  loss from Wednesday  sending front month WTI prices tumbling 2 7  for last week 
U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of orchestrating a series of attacks on tankers in the strait  in what he said was Iran s effort to get the U S  to ease up on sanctions  The narrow waterway is seen as the world s most sensitive choke point for transporting crude 
Meanwhile  August Brent crude BRNQ19   0 18  dropped  1 07  or 1 7   to  60 94 a barrel on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures Europe in Monday action  Brent finished down 2  for last week 

Last week s losses followed reports of an expected slowdown in oil demand  In a report Friday  the International Energy Agency downgraded its 2019 forecast for global oil demand for a second straight month  citing  in part  a global economic slowdown  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had also cut its forecast for growth in world oil demand this year 
 For oil prices to see a sustained rebound  trade uncertainty needs to be removed   though  geopolitical risks should see Brent and WTI supported around the  60 and  50 a barrel  respectively  said Moya 
The market is also awaiting a decision by OPEC and its allies on whether to extend their production cut deal past the end of this month  when it expires  Citing comments from Saudi energy minister Khalid al Falih in Tokyo  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts reported Monday that the Saudis are  absolutely  confident OPEC and non OPEC partners will agree to extend their oil production cut deal 
Al Falih said that all OPEC members  except one  have agreed to delay the group s June 25 26 meeting to the first week of July  according to the report  The decision to change the date would have to be unanimous

Back in the U S   a monthly report from Energy Information Administration Monday showed that crude oil production from seven major U S  shale plays is forecast to climb by 70 000 barrels a day in July to 8 520 million barrels a day 
In other energy trading  July gasoline RBN19   2 10  fell 2 4  to  1 691 a gallon  with prices down 0 4  for last week  July heating oil HON19   1 46  declined by 1 6  to  1 800 a gallon  after a weekly rise of 0 3

116334,337849,SPGI,Exclusive  China Inc s mounting stress   funding woes  shrinking profit growth and a trade war,news,"By Adam Jourdan and Gaurav Dogra SHANGHAI BENGALURU  Reuters    China Inc s profit growth has fallen sharply while debt levels have recorded a rare drop  a Reuters analysis of earnings data shows   signs of strain brought on by Beijing s crackdown on leverage as well as a trade war with the United States  Easy access to funds had long fueled growth for mainland Chinese firms but a concerted campaign by authorities to rid the financial system of excessive liquidity and rein in irrational corporate expansion is taking its toll  A rapid bruising of consumer confidence amid trade tension with the United States has added pain  creating a major challenge for Beijing as it looks to keep the economy on track after it expanded at its weakest pace since 2009 in the third quarter  Chinese firms managed a combined net profit rise of just 3 9 percent in the third quarter  compared with jumps of 20 55 percent seen in each quarter for the past two years  according to the Reuters analysis of earnings for 1 950 firms listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen  Earnings for Hengkang Medical Group Co Ltd  which has made acquisitions of medical institutions central to its business strategy  highlight the strong connection between credit conditions and corporate health in China   Capital markets are tight and the cost of borrowing is pretty high   said Li Dan  a securities official at Hengkang s board of directors office and one of a dozen executives interviewed by Reuters for this article  Fierce competition for M A funds  plus the slowing economy pushed the company into the red for the third quarter  she said  China Inc profits squeezed    Combined debt at Chinese firms dropped 1 6 percent to about 12 trillion yuan   1 7 trillion  for the quarter from a year earlier   the first decline in the nine years of comparable data available for roughly 1 400 of the companies  That was down 11 5 percent from the previous quarter  also the steepest quarter on quarter decline of the past nine years  Metals firm Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Co Ltd  which cited a drop in prices for its weaker profits  said it was a  tricky  time for financing   The market environment is really not good  When we did our issuance  we came under great pressure and almost didn t succeed with the fund raising   an official at the company said   Lots of companies though aren t able now to raise money in private fund raising successfully at all   he said  Like many company officials Reuters spoke with he asked not to be identified by name  China Inc debt in rare drop    CHEAP AND CHEERFUL Revenue growth remained more robust at 13 4 percent  in line with growth earlier in the year  though down from a climb of 21 6 percent in the same quarter in 2017   But pressure on profits was coming from a number of fronts  according to the companies interviewed  In addition to weaker demand and higher funding costs  they cited poor returns on financial investments  inventory build up as well as downward pressure on product prices that was fuelling competition among firms   Our prices have dropped a lot this year   said a senior official at LONGi Green Energy Technology Co Ltd  adding that the margins on its products for the solar power industry had dropped to 20 percent from 30 percent last year  That contributed to a 62 percent slide in third quarter profit   The demand side is weakening  One  it s because of credit availability  Two is weakening sentiment due to the trade issue escalation   said Christopher Lee  Hong Kong based managing director for corporate ratings at S P Global  NYSE SPGI    A lot of these private companies are under stress in the last couple of months   he said  adding that he expected the government to roll out more measures that would make it easier for businesses to gain funding  By sector  financial firms were the hardest hit with the industry seeing an average 52 percent decline in third quarter net profit  Not only hurt by the crackdown on risky lending in the shadow banking sector  a sharp slide in China stocks has reduced the value of many of their holdings   Sudden slowdown in Q3    Firms in the so called consumer discretionary sector  saw net profits drop 1 8 percent from the same quarter a year earlier   a stark contrast to growth of 21 5 percent in the second quarter and the first decline in trackable data that goes back to mid 2016  That represents a further ominous sign for consumer spending  Others include a slide in China car sales that has brought the world s biggest car market closer to a rare annual contraction as well as weak profit growth for premium liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd  a bellwether for China s luxury sales  Sales for e commerce giant  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd s annual shopping bonanza Singles  Day rose at their slowest ever rate despite topping  30 billion   in part due to a stalling real estate market hitting sales of big ticket items  Belt tightening by consumers is also forcing companies to roll out discounts to keep up sales   Consumers are increasingly looking for better value and better   and bigger savings   Joey Wat  CEO of Yum China Holdings Inc  told analysts after the company announced its third quarter sales last month  The firm  which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in China  had seen  very aggressive promotion  from rivals that had increased competition to lure in diners  
 In the short term  KFC can do that  There s nothing wrong to offer something  it s a lovely term called cheap and cheerful  particularly during some slightly tougher times for customers   she said ",2018-11-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-china-incs-mounting-stress--funding-woes-shrinking-profit-growth-and-a-trade-war-1688928,1688928

116341,337856,SPGI,Natural Gas Inventory Injection Comes In Above Expectations,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected increase in natural gas supplies  The injection was also higher than the five year average as mild spring weather continues to limit heating and air conditioning demand 
Analysis  More than Expected Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 106 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 10  above the guidance  of 101 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  Moreover  the increase was higher than the five year  2014 2018  average net injection of 89 Bcf and last year s increase of 104 Bcf for the reported week 
The latest rise in inventories puts total natural gas stocks at 1 653 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    130 Bcf  8 5   above 2018 levels at this time but 286 Bcf  14 7   under the five year average 
Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 94 4 Bcf per day  essentially unchanged on a weekly basis as dry production remained flat  Meanwhile  daily consumption rose 1 6  to 77 Bcf primarily due to stronger residential commercial demand 
Natural Gas Futures Remain Below  3
While natural gas futures have edged up a bit from the 3 year lows of below  2 5 per MMBtu in April and currently trade around  2 6 per MMBtu  it s still 47  below the four year high of  4 929 per MMBtu reached in mid November 
The early onset of winter  together with the lowest level of stocks in 15 years  demand from power plants and growing LNG shipments lifted the commodity to almost  5 per MMBtu  But the euphoria didn t last long as a mild weather led to smaller withdrawals that markedly reduced the storage deficit and sent prices lower 
What s the Future of Natural Gas Prices 
The fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 35   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand   
However  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements  Also  with the traditional withdrawal season  when supplies fall on heating demand due to cold weather  having ended in March  consumption is likely to decline in the near term 
Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now 
The uncertain natural gas fundamentals  considering its seasonal nature  is responsible for the understandable reluctance on investors  part to dip their feet into these stocks 
Moreover  most natural gas heavy upstream companies like Gulfport Energy Corp    NASDAQ GPOR    Antero Resources   NYSE AR    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG    SilverBow Resources  Inc    NYSE SBOW    Southwestern Energy Company   NYSE SWN   etc  carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which means that investors should preferably wait for a better entry point before buying shares in them   Some like Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   are further down the pecking order  with Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
If you are looking for near term natural gas play  Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC   might be a good selection  The company has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
You can see  
This Fort Worth  TX headquartered company s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years currently stands at 23 7   comparing favorably with the  growth rate of 19 1

116344,337859,SPGI,4 Utility Mutual Funds To Counter US Sino Trade Spat,opinion,"Fresh trade tensions between the United States and China are not only inducing volatility in the equity markets again  but also threatening business investment and growth in the country  which is making investors flee to safer grounds 
President Donald Trump s new executive order on securing the information and communications technology and services supply chain coupled with the prolonged U S  China trade war is taking a toll on the technology sector  with blue chip tech companies and chipmakers being hit hard 
The order gives the government the authority to restrict transactions related to information or communications technology that pose threats to national security  It states that technology which is  designed  developed  manufactured  or supplied  by persons owned by  controlled by  or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary  can be blocked by the government 
The order makes it difficult for foreign technology companies to conduct business with American organizations  For instance  the U S  government blacklisted Huawei Technologies Inc  last week  which prevents American companies from selling or transferring technology to the company without government authorization 
However  the U S  government temporarily eased some restrictions on the Chinese telecom giant this week  allowing it to buy U S  made goods for providing software updates to existing Huawei handsets and maintaining existing networks  But the uncertainty over conducting business and further change in trade policies looms large 
Earlier this month  U S  Sino trade talks came to a halt owing to Trump s dissatisfaction with the progress of negotiations on a new trade agreement  In addition  the increased tariffs on Chinese goods since May 10 worsened the scenario 
But tariffs aren t the only concern for financial markets now  Trump s executive order is also affecting U S  technology companies with international trade and transactions 
In such a gloomy scenario  investors must focus on companies that primarily offer services whose demand is unlikely to dampen  After all  not all sectors are exposed to trade tariffs or restrictive trade orders in the country 
This brings us to the utility sector 
Why Invest in Utility 
In times of market uncertainties  mutual funds that invest in utility companies are the best bets  First  utility companies are non cyclical  which means that these never encounter diminished demand even in grim economic scenarios because of the nature of services they offer  After all  water  electricity and HVAC  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  are necessities one can t do away with 
In fact  the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLU   which climbed 2 9  in the past one month  is one of the four out of 11 sectors that gained in the same timeframe 
Now we come to the second most vital question  why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds  read more

Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 100 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 17  below the guidance  of 103 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  However  the increase was higher than the five year  2014 2018  average net injection of 88 Bcf and last year s increase of 93 Bcf for the reported week 
The latest rise in inventories puts total natural gas stocks at 1 753 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    137 Bcf  8 5   above 2018 levels at this time but 274 Bcf  13 5   under the five year average 
Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 93 6 Bcf per day  essentially unchanged on a weekly basis even as dry production edged down slightly  Meanwhile  daily consumption fell 2 5  to 75 Bcf primarily due to weaker residential commercial demand 
Natural Gas Futures Remain Just Above  2 5
While natural gas futures have edged up a bit from the 3 year lows of below  2 5 per MMBtu in April and currently trade around  2 6 per MMBtu  it s still 47  below the four year high of  4 929 per MMBtu reached in mid November 
The early onset of winter  together with the lowest level of stocks in 15 years  demand from power plants and growing LNG shipments lifted the commodity to almost  5 per MMBtu  But the euphoria didn t last long as a mild weather led to smaller withdrawals that markedly reduced the storage deficit and sent prices lower 
What Is the Future of Natural Gas Prices 
The fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 35   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand   
However  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements  Also  with the traditional withdrawal season  when supplies fall on heating demand due to cold weather  having ended in March  consumption is likely to decline in the near term

116357,337872,SPGI,Massive Wall Of Corporate Debt Reaches Tipping Point,opinion,"While the mainstream financial media finally realizes that everything s  not so great  in the global economy   there s even more to worry about 
I m talking about the ticking time bomb in the corporate debt market  Which I believe will play a large role in the next financial crisis 
Let me explain     
After years of corporations gorging on  cheap  debt   thanks to the Federal Reserve s post 2008 zero interest rate policy  ZIRP    many are now at the edge of seeing their credit ratings downgraded 
To put things into perspective   according to S P Global  NYSE SPGI    there s over  7 trillion worth of BBB rated debt  including notes  bonds  term loans  and revolving credit lines  worldwide   With  3 5 trillion belonging to U S  firms  
Why does this matter 
Because BBB rated debt is the last notch in the investment grade  IG  level  And anything below is considered speculative grade  aka junk    meaning there s suddenly a much higher chance of default 
Now   before I go on   here s some context about investment grade and junk debt 
When a credit agency  like S P or Moody s  labels a corporation s debt investment grade  BBB and higher    it s technically saying that it believes based on the company s current financials and economic outlook that the chance of a default is minor   A firm with a higher credit rating means they pay less interest  
But when the credit agency labels a corporation s debt junk  BB or lower    it s saying there s a high chance that a firm may default on their creditors   A firm with a lower credit rating means they pays more in interest  
Also   keep in mind that many institutional investors   such as insurance firms  pension funds  some mutual funds and exchange traded funds  ETF s    can t legally own anything lower than investment grade debt   This means money managers would be forced to dump these holdings   leading to a sharp drop in bond prices  
Thus   you can see how fragile things are when 53    3 2 trillion  of the total investment grade debt category in the U S  is BBB rated   Just one step away from being labeled junk  

All this is why I believe that the corporate debt market is nearing a  tipping point    especially as economic conditions worldwide worsen  And dollar liquidity continues drying up 
For instance   making matters worse   there s roughly  1 9 trillion in BBB rated U S  corporate debt that s maturing over the next four years     

This means many of these firms must either repay creditors the full principle owed with cash on hand  Or roll over  refinance  their existing debt  meaning they will need take out new debt to repay old debt  
But   since most of these firms are near junk already   I ll assume most don t have the cash on hand to repay the maturing debts  Thus needing to borrow more 
The problem is   if economic conditions continue to sour   then these BBB rated firms will be stuck between a rock and hard place 
On the one side   during an economic downturn   creditors hold more cash or buy U S  government bonds   Some may lend to firms  but only those of the highest quality   So they won t be freely lending to near junk rated firms 
And on the other side   during an economic downturn   these BBB rated firms will be at risk of their credit ratings dropping as their earnings decline  Making it even more difficult to find creditors willing to lend them capital 
Thus   it s clear if the global economy continues weakening that these firms won t have access to cash when they need it most   Which is historically what leads to a wave of corporate defaults      
So   in summary   the massive amount of near junk rated debt  BBB  has put investment grade bondholders  pension funds  insurance firms  etc  in a very fragile position  Especially as economic conditions continue declining 
Making matters worse   most of these firms only piled on debt to fulfill short term agendas   such as buying back stock or paying dividends 
But such superficial tactics rarely ever work out well in the long term 
Thus   in the near future   many of these firms may pay for their short term thinking 
So don t be surprised if the high yield bond market  the junk market  begins choking on all these  fallen angels    The name given to investment grade firms when they re downgraded to junk  
I know I won t 
One thing that will help these BBB rated firms is if the Federal Reserve ends up cutting rates   which many now expect  So take that into account 
I m not opposed to buying junk bonds  Some offer significant positive asymmetry  But I ll wait first until the next downturn when they re greatly discounted   and only then ",2019-06-04,Adem Tumerkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/theres-a-massive-wall-of-corporate-debt-thats-one-notch-from-junk-200428048,200428048
116358,337873,SPGI,4 Mutual Funds To Invest In Despite Yield Curve Inversion,opinion,"The yield curve s recent inversion has given investors more reasons to panic amid trade tensions  As market volatility remained a factor in denting investors  confidence in the stock market  yield curve inversion has brought government bonds in the limelight    
Therefore  fund investors seeking to take minimal risks could opt for mutual funds that invest heavily in government bonds in these turbulent times 
Yield Curve Inversion Sparks Recession Fears
The return on the benchmark 10 year Treasury yield edged up slightly on Jun 4  2 12    although remaining largely lower than the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill  2 35    The current scenario has attracted investor attention because  usually  the return on the bonds with a longer maturity periods is higher than that of those with lower maturity periods  This is because investors demand higher returns on their investments for longer durations  pushing the curve upward 
However  yield curve inversion indicates that investors aren t very confident about the future of the economy and hence aren t willing to bet on its long term prospects  This could cause investors to stop spending and investing  leading the U S  economy to contract and fall into a recession 
Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  further noted earlier this week that the global economy could enter a recession in three quarters  Trade disputes are the prime reason behind this assessment  The investment bank said that global demand could get curbed by reduced capital expenditures 
In fact  J P  Morgan Chase slashed its forecast for the 10 year Treasury yield to 1 75  from its previous forecast of 2 45  at year end  following President Donald Trump s threat to put tariffs on Mexican imports  This conforms to the possibility of the Fed lowering interest rates this year to sustain the economy  
Our Choices
We have  thus  selected four mutual funds that largely invest in government bonds and carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy   Moreover  these funds have encouraging one year returns  Additionally  the minimum initial investment is less than  5000 
We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future  Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but also on the likely future success of the fund

116363,337878,SPGI,Falling Peso Hits Debt Laden Philippine Companies,news," Bloomberg     The Philippines  biggest companies face another year of significant repayments of U S  dollar debt after record amounts came due in 2018  even as a slumping peso makes it costlier to pay back 
A total of  4 9 billion in dollar bonds and loans have matured or will still come due in 2018  more than four times the amount last year and the highest since at least 2003  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Obligations that groups such as San Miguel Corp   SM Investments Corp  and Ayala Corp  need to refinance or repay in the next five years will remain sizable 
The Philippine credit market is seeing reminders of the late 1990s Asian financial crisis  as big companies including banks  brewers and builders must pay back dollar debt at a time when the home currency is depreciating 
The peso  among Asia s worst performers this year  will likely weaken by 2 4 percent in 2019 to 54 90 pesos per dollar and to 55 the year after  according to a Bloomberg survey  It closed at 53 590 a dollar on Oct  30 
As currency volatility lingers  the Philippine central bank is closely monitoring corporate credit for risks it could pose to the financial system 
Huge exposure to foreign currency debt  at a time when the peso has touched 12 year lows  could erode corporate profitability and add to banks  overall credit risks  the central bank said in an emailed reply to questions  This is especially true for companies that haven t sufficiently hedged their dollar obligations  it said 
Probably only 20 percent to 30 percent of private dollar debt is hedged  excluding any natural cover from dollar earnings  according to Eduardo Francisco  president of BDO Capital   Investment Corp   which is engaged in securities underwriting  loan syndication and the financial advisory business  No official numbers are reported to the central bank 
 Hedging levels have likely remained the same over the years because hedge cover has always been expensive   Francisco said   The market is not that deep  
The most at risk from the peso slump are construction and transportation companies  whose revenues are in the local currency but they make large investments in dollars  according to S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings analyst Bertrand Jabouley 
San Miguel and its energy units have to pay off the most dollar debt in the next five years at  3 3 billion  based on publicly available data  The beer maker that had expanded to infrastructure enters into currency swaps to manage its long term borrowings  according to regulatory filings 
The conglomerate and units including oil refiner Petron Corp  and SMC Global Power Holdings Corp  have been borrowing in pesos in the past three years to refinance dollar obligations  The company declined to provide details of its hedging

While hedge cover remains costly  companies like Ayala count on their dollar earnings to provide protection  The conglomerate  whose banking  utility and telecom units face  1 5 billion in outstanding dollar debt to 2023  said in latest regulatory filings it is fully covered by its foreign currency assets 
 Despite the weakness of the peso against the dollar  Ayala did not incur materially significant debt related foreign exchange losses  as of the third quarter  it said 
SM Investments vice chairman Teresita Sy Coson said she doesn t expect the peso slump to have a great impact on the company s ability to service its debts 
 As long as we re hedged  we re OK  We ve learned our lessons from the 1997 Asian financial crisis   she said  SM  which owns the Philippines  biggest bank and largest mall operator  has  1 9 billion in outstanding dollar debt in the next five years ",2018-10-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/falling-peso-hits-debtladen-philippine-companies-1666871,1666871

Oil prices had the worst monthly performance since July 2016 in the previous session  with Brent falling by 8 8  and crude tumbling 10 9  
U S  Energy Information Administration data showed that crude stocks rose for the sixth straight week  reaching 1 08 million barrels per day  bpd  in the week to Oct  26   Source  U S  crude production stood at 11 3 million barrels per day in August  up 3 8  compared to July  and had surged 22 7  from August last year 
 The strong built in oil inventories is likely to keep downward pressure on oil prices   ANZ Research analysts told Reuters 
A survey from Reuters also showed that OPEC s oil production in October was 33 31 million bpd  up 390 000 bpd from September and the highest since December 2016  The organization agreed to boost oil output to cool the price surge and compensate for the decrease in Iranian output due to U S  sanctions

116365,337880,SPGI,Iran oil exports to plummet in Nov  then rebound as buyers use waivers,news,"By Henning Gloystein and Alex Lawler SINGAPORE LONDON  Reuters    Iran s oil exports have fallen sharply since U S  President Donald Trump said at mid year he would reimpose sanctions on Tehran  but with waivers in hand the Islamic Republic s major buyers are already planning to scale up orders again   The original aim of the sanctions was to cut Iran s oil exports as much as possible  to quash its nuclear and ballistic missile programs  and curb its support for militant proxies  particularly in Syria  Yemen and Lebanon   But the exemptions granted to Iran s biggest oil clients   China  India  South Korea  Japan  Italy  Greece  Taiwan and Turkey   allow them to import at least some oil for another 180 days and could mean exports start to rise after November   This group of eight buyers imported over 80 percent of Iran s roughly 2 6 million barrels per day  bpd  of oil exports last year  Refiniv Eikon data shows  GRAPHIC  Iranian oil imports of 8 countries given waivers     The decision by the U S   to grant waivers  represents a departure  for now  from the stated aim of reducing Iran s oil exports to zero   said Pat Thaker  regional director for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit   Iran s crude exports have fallen significantly from at least 2 5 million bpd in April  before Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions  although estimates vary  As a result of pre sanctions pressure by Washington  Iran s oil exports in November may not exceed 1 million to 1 5 million bpd  according to industry estimates  Companies that monitor Iran s shipments are already seeing a drop in tanker activity this month   We ve only seen 10 tankers loading at  or signaling for Iranian terminals in November so far  which is significantly lower than what we usually see at the beginning of the month   said Kpler  a data intelligence company  According to Refinitiv Eikon data  Iranian crude exports have fallen to 1 million bpd so far in November   An industry source who also monitors such shipments said the figure was likely to be on the low side  Iran expects to maintain crude exports of at least 1 1 million bpd after the reimposition of sanctions  a source familiar with Iranian thinking said  as the global market is too tight to allow a full stoppage  In October  Iran s crude exports were estimated at 1 82 million bpd by Kpler and 1 5 million bpd by another firm that monitors Iranian shipments  JAPAN TO RESUME Japan s trade minister  Hiroshige Seko  said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers of Iranian oil were expected to resume imports from the Islamic Republic after the country received a waiver from U S  sanctions  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts reported on Tuesday that South Korea would be able to take around 4 million barrels a month  130 000 bpd  of Iranian crude and condensate under a U S  sanctions waiver  Japan and South Korea  close U S  allies  had toed the Washington sanctions line and stopped buying crude from Iran   India  Iran s second biggest oil customer  also cut orders ahead of the sanctions  hoping its effort to reduce reliance on Tehran would pay off in Washington and win it a waiver once the sanctions restarted  Even China  locked in a bitter trade war with the United States  bowed to pressure from Washington and dialled back imports   GRAPHIC  Iran oil exports    TAKING THE STING OUT OF SANCTIONS  Trading sources said several Asian oil importers were looking to increase their orders for Iranian oil soon  Two Chinese sources familiar with the matter said the country would be allowed to buy 360 000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period   That would be about half the daily average China has been importing from Iran since January 2016  trade data showed   One of the sources said the United States had attached some strings to the import allowance  including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods  which were being evaluated before placing new orders with Iran  Both sources were not permitted to talk to the media about Iran sanctions and declined to be identified   A merchant trader  who also declined to be named  said  enquiries for cargoes from Iran are     coming in from several Asian buyers   The wide ranging exemptions have reduced fears of a supply shortage  taking pressure off companies  governments and economies around the world that have struggled with the surging cost of fuel  Trump  facing crucial midterm elections that may cost Republicans control of the U S  Congress  said on Monday he wants to impose sanctions on Iran s oil gradually  citing concerns about shocking markets and causing global price spikes   That has helped to take the sting out of the sanctions threat  which helped to lift international benchmark Brent crude futures  LCOc1  to four year highs of almost  87 a barrel in early October   Brent prices are now about 15 percent lower than that peak and have barely budged over the last two sessions   Now it will be key to watch  what happens after the exemptions expire in 180 days   the merchant trader said   
Iran s oil exports rose sharply after the previous round of sanctions were lifted in early 2016  Including condensate  an ultra light form of crude  shipments peaked around 3 million bpd in mid 2018  according to trade data in Refinitiv Eikon ",2018-11-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/iran-oil-exports-to-plummet-in-november-then-rebound-as-buyers-use-waivers-1675342,1675342
116367,337882,SPGI,Shale Boom Changes Way U S  Gas Traders Buy and Sell,news," Bloomberg     North American natural gas bets are moving closer to the nerve centers of the shale boom in the U S  East 
In a ranking of the gas hubs with the largest physical trading volumes  Louisiana s Henry Hub    the benchmark for U S  gas futures    has fallen to 38th place this year after being third just eight years ago  Instead  points in western Pennsylvania and the Southeast  nearer to the prolific Marcellus Shale basin  are becoming the go to spots for pricing gas 
As gas markets get more volatile    the futures contract based on Henry Hub moved as much as 8 9 percent Monday  the most since January    traders are increasingly looking at other options to bet on regional pricing differences  It s another effect of the waning role of production from the Gulf Coast  once the heart of U S  production  as output in Appalachia and the Permian Basin soars 
While it s still  wildly successful  as a futures contract  traders have been expressing  frustration with Henry Hub because they felt like it doesn t reflect some of the spot market volatility   said Mark Callahan  editorial director of Americas generating fuels and power pricing at S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts in Houston 
This past winter was an example of the kind of dramatic price spikes that can roil regional gas markets in the colder months  New York City gas jumped to more than  140 on Jan  4  while Henry Hub spot prices settled at  2 88  The new Northeast regional index would have jumped to  22 15 
The Dominion South Point hub in western Pennsylvania    home to the Marcellus basin  the biggest U S  shale play    is among the top three physically traded gas hubs by volume this year  according to Intercontinental Exchange Inc  Transco Zone 4  the price for gas delivered to the Southeast on a massive interstate pipeline  was the most popular 
To reflect the gas trading shift  Intercontinental Exchange and S P Global Platts have introduced regional indexes that price the fuel based on the biggest pipeline flows  including Transco 4 in the Southeast and Marcellus receipt points in the Northeast 
That doesn t mean Henry Hub is going away  It still ranks first globally among the most actively traded gas futures contracts  according to CME Group  NASDAQ CME  and Intercontinental Exchange 
The Platts ICE Natural Gas Index Americas include the Northeast  South  Midwest and West and a composite for North America  Each of the regions is made up of the five biggest flow points based on seasonal trends 
 The real advantage to using flow data is that it really allow these indices to really reflect the seasonality we see in natural gas in terms of supply and demand   Callahan said

A quarter ago  it was expected that this independent ratings and analytics provider would post earnings of  2 20 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 22  delivering a surprise of 0 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
S P Global  which belongs to the Zacks Business   Information Services industry  posted revenues of  1 57 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 60   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 57 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
S P Global shares have added about 29 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for S P Global 
While S P Global has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for S P Global was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Analysis  In Line Rise in Storage
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 85 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 3  matching the guidance as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  However  the increase was higher than the five year  2014 2018  average net injection of 72 Bcf  while the reported week saw a similar increase last year 
Following past week s supply addition  at 1 547 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   natural gas inventories are 303 Bcf  16 4   under the five year average but 128 Bcf  9   above the year ago figure 
Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 94 4 Bcf per day  essentially unchanged on a weekly basis as dry production remained flat  Meanwhile  daily consumption fell 1 8  to 76 Bcf primarily due to weaker residential commercial demand with temperatures falling back to normal territory 
Natural Gas Futures Struggle to Reach  3
While natural gas futures have edged up a bit from the 3 year lows of below  2 5 per MMBtu in April and currently trade around  2 6 per MMBtu  it s still 47  below the four year high of  4 929 per MMBtu reached in mid November  The early onset of winter  together with the lowest level of stocks in 15 years  demand from power plants and growing LNG shipments lifted the commodity to almost  5 per MMBtu  But the euphoria didn t last long as a mild weather led to smaller withdrawals that markedly reduced the storage deficit and sent prices lower 
What is the Future of Natural Gas Prices 
The fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 35   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand  
However  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements  Also  with the traditional withdrawal season  when supplies fall on heating demand due to cold weather  having ended in March  consumption is likely to decline in the near term

116394,337909,SPGI,NYC pension fund leader asks index providers to reconsider Saudi Arabia,news,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON  Reuters    Top financial market index providers should reconsider their recent decisions to add Saudi Arabia to emerging markets products  New York City s chief pension fund official said on Wednesday  citing  disturbing allegations  about the kingdom after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
In letters to three major index providers sent on Wednesday and seen by Reuters  New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer wrote he was concerned that keeping the country in the indexes would expose his funds and others to unsuitable investments 
 Saudi Arabia has demonstrated a disdain for the rule of law and international norms of due process and human rights   creating risks for investors  he wrote 
Spokespeople for the three index providers who received the letters   MSCI Inc   N MSCI   FTSE Russell and S P Dow Jones Indices all declined to comment 
Stringer oversees New York City s roughly  195 billion public pension system  one of the largest in the U S  His call marked only the latest move among Western political and financial leaders to distance themselves from Saudi Arabia after the journalist s death sparked global condemnation 
On Wednesday Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed Khashoggi s killers would be brought to justice  in his first public comments about the matter 
Exclusion from the indexes would mark a setback for Saudi Arabia after the world s top oil producer was upgraded since March by each of the three well known index providers on the strength of market reforms spearheaded by the ruler widely known as MbS 
The Saudi Stock Exchange had said in September it expected a heavy inflow of foreign money in 2019   perhaps  20 billion or more   as it joins major emerging markets indexes 
A spokesperson for Stringer said the pension system has no direct investments in Saudi companies currently  A public disclosure shows that as of July funds run by his office had  15 5 billion allocated to emerging markets 
Index providers had previously said Saudi Arabia would account for around 2 7 percent of emerging markets index products  which would give the city s funds an exposure to the country of about  420 million

116404,337919,SPGI,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For S P Global  SPGI ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  S P Global  NYSE SPGI   which belongs to the Zacks Business   Information Services industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This independent ratings and analytics provider has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 94  
For the last reported quarter  S P Global came out with earnings of  2 22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 20 per share  representing a surprise of 0 91   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 01 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 11 per share  delivering a surprise of 4 98  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for S P Global lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
S P Global has an Earnings ESP of  0 79  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-sp-global-spgi-200412498,200412498

S P Global Ratings has appointed Meshari Al Khaled as S P Global Ratings  managing director and office head for its Saudi Arabian branch 
 As Saudi Arabia s capital markets evolve to match the size of the country s economy  there is a prime potential for greater debt issuance   Al Khaled said in a statement   Only 15 percent of listed companies in Saudi Arabia have a credit rating so there is a significant opportunity for S P Global Ratings to serve investors through our objective evaluation of risk for governments  corporates and financial institutions  
Companies in the Gulf s largest economy have traditionally relied on bank loans to support their financing requirements  But the impact of lower oil prices have reduced liquidity in the banking sector so the government has taken steps to encourage companies to raise money by selling bonds to reduce pressure on local banks  liquidity 
Saudi Arabia has become a key issuer in the international debt markets after selling a  17 5 billion debut international bond last year   the largest bond ever sold across emerging markets  Since then the country has also sold a  9 billion international sukuk and some additional  12 5 billion in conventional bonds this year 
But dollar bond issuance from Saudi banks and companies has remained subdued this year  despite investors  expectations of a flurry of deals after the establishment of a yield curve by the Saudi Arabia s sovereign deals 
The final license obtained by S P Global Ratings allows the agency  one of the three major global rating agencies  to conduct credit rating activities in the kingdom

116451,337966,SPGI,Indian Drought  Coming After Brazil s Ethanol Rush  Delivers A Sugar High,opinion,"Mother Nature has joined oil in adding to sugar prices 
Drought in the world s second largest sugar grower  India  has brightened the outlook for the sweetener s prices after a supply squeeze already caused by top producer Brazil s allocation of more its cane crop to ethanol making  due to the rally in oil  Output from India s key sugar producing Maharashtra state could hit three year lows due to dry weather  Bloomberg reported on Tuesday 
As well  Brazil has a 27  mandate for ethanol in its gasoline far higher than the 10  imposed on most U S  motor fuels  That has traditionally prompted local sugarcane growers to focus more on the energy industry than food for their market  a strategy paying dividends with this year s powerful rise in crude oil 
Less than 39  of the cane crush in the South American country would be dedicated to sugar making as ethanol continues to pry away production  Platts  the business newswire of S P Global  NYSE SPGI   reported last month 

Both the Indian and Brazilian factors have colluded to make raw sugar this year s top performer among the so called soft commodity markets  New York traded sugar futures have a year to date gain of more than 6   versus the rise of less than 1  in cocoa and declines of nearly 8  in coffee and 13  in orange juice 
In the previous two years  New York sugar futures tumbled almost 40  from supply gluts 
At Tuesday s settlement of 12 77 cents a lb  benchmark May sugar futures on New York s ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures were still rated a  Strong Buy  by technical analysts on Investing com  The contract was also pegged with a top end resistance of 13 cents  If it got to that level  it may have a chance to reprise the 2019 high of 13 50 cents hit on Feb  17 
Bloomberg reported that prolonged dry weather in India s Maharashtra was affecting the state s sugar cane planting  and production may drop 25  from a year ago to reach just 8 million tons in the year staring on Oct  1  That would be the biggest fall since 2016 17  when production almost halved 
The forecast comes as private Indian forecaster Skymet Weather Services predicts a drier than normal monsoon for the country this year  potentially shriveling crops and cutting plantings  That may offer relief for producers such as Australia and Brazil  which have complained to the World Trade Organization that India s gushing exports and subsidies are suppressing global prices 
Despite the supportive technicals as well as fundamentals over India and Brazil  some analysts like Jack Scoville of the Price Futures Group in Chicago urged caution against buying into the sugar rush 
 The fundamentals still suggest big supplies and ideas of big production in Asia also help keep any rallies in check   Scoville said  citing higher Thai and Pakistani output  among others 
But he acknowledged that Brazil has been using a larger part of its sugarcane harvest to produce ethanol instead of sugar  and weather in the top producing country has turned unsuitably drier 
Brazil s sugar ethanol ratio for cane averaged 44 56 over the past five years 
But this year s oil rally  which boosted U S  West Texas Intermediate crude by 41  and global benchmark Brent by 31   has tilted the balance even further toward ethanol 
Platts said Brazilian ethanol prices have maintained a wide premium to domestic sugar quotes  attracting more cane crush for that purpose  Brazil s higher than expected fuel consumption  in turn  was fueling even more ethanol production ",2019-04-10,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/indian-drought-coming-after-brazils-ethanol-rush-delivers-a-sugar-high-200405393,200405393

116472,337987,SPGI,FedEx Slashed Revenue Forecast Amid Macroeconomic Concerns,opinion," Slowing international macroeconomic conditions  is just a fancy way to say that the global economy is in big trouble  For months  I have been warning that economic conditions are deteriorating  and we just keep getting more confirmation that we are facing the worst global downturn since the last financial crisis  For the second time in three months  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  has slashed its revenue forecast for this year  In an attempt to explain why revenue is declining  FedEx s chief financial officer placed the blame squarely on the faltering global economy  The following comes from CNBC 

The multinational package delivery service reported declining international revenue as a result of unfavorable exchange rates and the negative effects of trade battles 
 Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue  as seen in the year over year decline in our FedEx Express international revenue   Alan B  Graf  Jr   FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   executive vice president and chief financial officer  said in statement 

The use of the word  trends  implies something that has been going on for an extended period of time  and obviously  FedEx doesn t expect things to get better any time soon if they have cut profit projections twice in just the last three months 
And FedEx certainly has a lot of company when it comes to having a gloomy outlook for the global economy  In one recent article  Bloomberg boldly declared that the global economy is in the worst shape it has been  since the financial crisis a decade ago  

The global economy s in its weakest shape since the financial crisis a decade ago  Bloomberg Economics analysis shows  And the reminders are all around  China got more affirming evidence of its big slowdown  with industrial output and retail sales softening and a jump in unemployment  The question now is how big that slowdown will be  and what China s stimulus   and the U S  China negotiations   will do to put a floor under it  The Chinese premier pledged Friday that they wouldn t use quantitative easing or massive deficit spending to ease the pain  Japan got more bad news on manufacturing sentiment and in the hard investment data  Germany  Europe s growth driver  can t hide from the daunting external risks  And Turkey just entered its first recession in a decade 

In recent weeks I have been sharing lots of numbers that back up the claim that global economic conditions are getting worse  and over the past few days we got a few more 
U S  freight volume has dropped for three months in a row 
In February  orders for Class 8 freight trucks were down 58 percent from a year ago 
U S  manufacturing output was down for a second straight month in the month of February 
U S  residential construction spending just plunged for the sixth month in a row 
Industrial production on a year over year basis in Europe has fallen for three months in a row 
When we see numbers like those  normally everyone is screaming  recession  by now 
And retailers continue to shut down at a staggering pace here in 2019  Sadly  we just learned that Shopko is officially heading for bankruptcy and liquidation 

Shopko will liquidate its assets and close all of its remaining locations by mid June 
The company was unable to find a buyer for the retail business and will begin winding down its operations beginning this week  the company said in statement released Monday  The decision to liquidate will bring an end to the brick and mortar business that began in 1962 with one location in Green Bay  Wisconsin 

There is a Shopko about 20 minutes from where I live  and it will definitely be missed 
Meanwhile  things just continue to get even harder for farmers in the middle part of the country  I wrote about the devastating impact that this historic flooding is having on Midwest farmers a few days ago  and now Fox Business is reporting that all of this flood damage is likely to make our rapidly growing farm bankruptcy crisis even worse 

The number of farms filing for bankruptcy already spiked  following low prices for corn  soybeans  milk and beef  according to analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  In the 12 month period ending in June  84 farms filed for bankruptcy in Wisconsin  Minnesota  North Dakota  South Dakota and Montana   double the number over the same period in 2013 and 2014 
Now  some of these farmers have lost their livestock as a result of the devastating flooding  Some farmers  the Times reported  said they ve been separated from their animals by walls of water  while others are unable to get into town for food and other supplies for the livestock 

We can see so many elements of  the perfect storm  starting to come together  and many believe that events are going to start greatly accelerating in the months ahead 
And as the global economy continues to deteriorate  we could quickly have a giant mess on our hands  because the global financial system is far more vulnerable today than it was in 2008  

Global debt levels have become  higher and riskier  than that of a decade ago  meaning that  another credit downturn may be inevitable   S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings has warned 
In a report entitled Next Debt Crisis  Will Liquidity Hold   published on Tuesday  12 March   S P found global debt has surged by around 50  since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis  led by major economy governments and Chinese non financial corporates  while global debt to GDP ratios have risen to more than 231   compared with 208  in June 2008 

Shipping companies often feel the effects of an economic slowdown earlier than just about anyone else  When a lot less stuff is being moved around by truck  rail  and air  that should be a clear indication for the rest of us that economic activity is really starting to slow down significantly 
So the fact that FedEx has such a bleak outlook for our immediate economic future is a very ominous sign

Chicago  IL   March 25  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Chevron   NYSE CVX    ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Marathon Petroleum   NYSE MPC   and ProPetro Holding Corp    NYSE PUMP   
Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  
U S  Crude   Fuel Stockpiles Slump  Oil Exports Increase
The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a large weekly decline on surging exports  Further to this  hefty draws in product inventories  gasoline and distillate  boosted bullish sentiment in the energy market 
As it is  crude is being supported by the so called OPEC  deal that is cutting production by around 1 2 million barrels per day until the end of June  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran also continue to tighten the commodity s fundamentals 
The positive sentiments helped push oil prices to their highest level in four months on Wednesday  with WTI moving past  60 per barrel during intraday trading  While  crude futures eased back slightly from their multi month highs yesterday  it continues to remain within touching distance of the  60 a barrel mark 
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 9 6 million barrels for the week ending Mar 15  following a decrease of 3 9 million barrels in the previous week  The analysts surveyed by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 1 million barrels 
A sharp rise in  and strong refiner demand led to the surprise stockpile plunge with the world s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rebounded to the highest level on record  Moreover  the latest report shows that stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was down 468 000 barrels to 46 4 million barrels 
At 439 5 million barrels  current crude supplies are 2 6  above the year ago figure but 2  under the five year average  The crude supply cover was down from 28 2 days in the previous week to 27 4 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 26 4 days 
Gasoline Gasoline supplies tallied a fifth straight week of drops as demand strengthened  The 4 6 million barrels decline   significantly above the polled number of 2 1 million barrels fall   took gasoline stockpiles down to 241 5 million barrels  Following last week s hefty draw  the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 0 7  below the year earlier level but are 2  over the five year range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  fell 4 1 million barrels last week  while analysts were looking for an inventory draw of just 2 1 million barrels  The large decrease could be attributed to red hot demand  Despite the decline  current supplies   at 132 2 million barrels   are around 1  higher than the year ago level though stocks remain 4  below than the five year average 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 1 3  from the prior week to 88 9  
About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry 
The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers  such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips  and refiners such as Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum 
Want to Own an Energy Stock Now 
While easing oversupply concerns and hopes of U S  China trade deal helped oil to bounce back above  60  it remains to be seen if it can maintain the recent gains  One factor that could undermine the efforts to tighten the market is the seemingly relentless increase in crude oil production across the U S  shale patch 
Meaning  there remains a lot of uncertainty around the commodity right now  which can lead to volatility and price fluctuations  At this time  it might be prudent for investors to maintain caution and look for fundamentally sound stocks 
If you are looking for a near term energy play  ProPetro Holding Corp  might be a good selection  ProPetro has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
The 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the provider of pressure pumping services in the Permian Basin is  2 39  representing 19 5  earnings per share growth over 2018  Next year s average forecast is  2 62 pointing to another 9 7  growth

over the week The EIA Inventory DataStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 47 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Mar 15  just below the guidance  of 48 Bcf decline  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  The decrease was also significantly lower than both the five year  2014 2018  average net shrinkage of 56 Bcf and last year s drop of 87 Bcf for the reported week Following past week s supply decline  at 1 143 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   natural gas inventories are 556 Bcf  32 7   under the five year average and 315 Bcf  21 6   below the year ago figure Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 93 5 Bcf per day  essentially unchanged on a weekly basis as dry production remained flat  Meanwhile  daily consumption fell 6 2  to 91 3 Bcf primarily due to weaker residential commercial sector demand amid higher than normal temperatures in California and the U S  Northeast Volatile Last Few Months for the FuelWhile natural gas has rallied more than 8  over the past month  it s still 44  below the four year high of  4 929 per MMBtu reached in mid November  The early onset of winter  together with the lowest level of stocks in 15 years  demand from power plants and growing LNG shipments lifted the commodity to almost  5 per MMBtu But the euphoria didn t last long as mild weather in December and early January led to smaller withdrawals that markedly reduced the storage deficit and sent prices lower What Lies Ahead The fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 35   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand   However  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways but for weather driven movements Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now The uncertain natural gas fundamentals  considering its seasonal nature  is

116484,337999,SPGI,U S  trial over S P ratings could begin in September 2015  take 4 months,news,"By Dana Feldman SANTA ANA CALIFORNIA  Reuters    A trial on the U S  government s  5 billion lawsuit against Standard   Poor s over the company s ratings of mortgage bonds prior to the 2008 financial crisis could begin in September 2015 and last four months  the federal judge overseeing the case said on Tuesday 
A trial against S P  a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc  could ideally be wrapped up before the 2015 holiday season  Judge David Carter  of U S  District Court for the Central District of California  said at a hearing  He declined to set a firm starting date 
The length of the trial and the millions of pages of documents needed for it reflect the challenges facing S P  the largest U S  credit rating agency  as it defends against lawsuits alleging it placed its own financial interests ahead of those of investors 
Last year  the U S  Department of Justice and many states accused S P of fraudulently representing that its ratings on structured finance securities were objective and not tainted by conflicts of interest 
In June  S P suffered a setback when another federal judge ruled that it must defend separately against similar lawsuits by 16 U S  states and Washington  D C   on Tuesday S P said it is now doing so 
Two weeks ago  The Wall Street Journal reported that S P was open to paying  1 billion to resolve the federal lawsuit  citing people familiar with the matter 
That issue was not addressed at Tuesday s hearing  where S P and its investment banking clients argued over who would foot the bill for the documents that the banks would need to produce for the government s case 
A lawyer for Bank of America Corp s Countrywide unit said the bank anticipated having to produce 100 million pages of documents  while a lawyer for Citigroup Inc said that bank has already turned over 16 5 million pages 
The paperwork has gotten so expansive that a lawyer for Deutsche Bank AG said the German lender had sent millions of pages of documents to India and other countries for workers there to conduct an initial review 
 Are you saying that citizens of another country are reviewing American citizens  banking records   Carter said  prompting laughter in the courtroom 

The Deutsche Bank lawyer responded that the outsourcing saved money

116485,338000,SPGI,U S  confident its  5 billion S P lawsuit was not retaliation,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    The United States  which is suing Standard   Poor s for  5 billion over its credit ratings  said on Monday it is confident that documents the rating agency wants for its defense will not show that the lawsuit was filed in retaliation for a downgrade of the country s debt 
In a filing with the U S  District Court in Santa Ana  California  the U S  Department of Justice said S P s  general suspicions  do not justify the rating agency s request for the release of dozens of unredacted documents  including materials from former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 
The Justice Department said it has submitted documents sought by S P to U S  District Judge David Carter  and is  confident  that his review will prove they  do not support the defendants  allegations of retaliation in any way  
Indeed  the Justice Department added in a footnote   The United States believes that the redacted information in certain of these documents would affirmatively rebut S P s claims  
Other material was redacted because it was privileged or irrelevant  the government said 
Catherine Mathis  an S P spokeswoman  declined to comment  A hearing is set for Sept  9 
S P  a unit of New York based McGraw Hill Financial Inc  has said the government singled it out for a lawsuit after it took away the United States   triple A  rating on Aug  5  2011 
The  5 billion lawsuit filed in February 2013 accused S P of issuing inflated ratings before the 2008 financial crisis to win more fees from issuers  and failing to downgrade debt backed by mortgage backed securities fast enough 
Harold McGraw  the chairman of McGraw Hill  has said Geithner angrily told him on Aug  8  2011  three days after the downgrade  that the downgrade was based on a  huge  math error  and that the company would be held  accountable  
S P has said its ratings are opinions protected by the U S  Constitution s First Amendment  It is represented by Floyd Abrams  a leading First Amendment specialist 

The case is U S  v  McGraw Hill Cos et al  U S  District Court  Central District of California  No  13 00779

116486,338001,SPGI,Exclusive  S P  Markit finalists for  1 billion plus Barclays index unit   sources,news,"By Mike Stone and Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters    Index provider Standard   Poor s and financial information services provider Markit Ltd  O MRKT  have emerged as final bidders for Barclays Plc s  L BARC  index business  which could fetch more than  1 billion  according to people familiar with the matter 
The British bank has narrowed the list of bidders to McGraw Hill Financial Inc s  N MHFI  S P Dow Jones Indices and Markit after an auction that also drew interest from several parties including MSCI Inc  N MSCI  and Bloomberg LP  the people said on Tuesday 
Barclays  which launched the long anticipated auction of its Index  Portfolio and Risk Solutions  IPRS  business this summer  could conclude the process within weeks  the people added  asking not to be named because the matter is private 
The business includes a basket of more than 98 major indexes  according to the unit s website 
Before Barclays provided detailed financial information on the index business  potential bidders estimated the unit to be worth several hundred million dollars 
But the business showed higher than expected revenue figures and the competition for the asset has proved robust  driving the price tag to more than  1 billion recently  the sources said 
Representatives for Barclays  Markit and S P declined to comment  S P is owned by McGraw Hill Financial Inc  N MHFI  
With investors pouring billions of dollars into passively managed funds  more firms are looking to broaden their index based offerings  In January  S P Dow Jones Indices Chief Executive Alex Matturri told Reuters it was interesting looking at bidding on index businesses that come to market  including the index businesses run by Russell and Barclays 
Barclays  U S  Aggregate Bond Index  which the bank bought as part of the Lehman Brothers acquisition during the financial crisis  is among the platform s best known offerings 
In addition  the Barclays business includes a risk solutions software tool used by institutional investors to perform analysis of their holdings 
Reuters first reported in November that Barclays began exploring options for the index business following an approach from MSCI 

Earlier this year  Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company  NMLIC UL  also ran a competitive process to find a buyer for its index businesses  Russell Investments  London Stock Exchange Group Plc  L LSE  bought Russell  the creator of the well known Russell 1000 Global Index  for  2 7 billion in cash

116500,338015,SPGI,Consolidation Deals  A Sign Miners Anticipate Bull Run In Gold Price ,opinion,"Last week I was pleased to attend the Prospectors   Developers Association of Canada  PDAC  conference in Toronto  PDAC is one of the largest mining conferences in the world  More than 25 000 people turned out this year  many of them selling equipment services  exhibiting securities and investments  making presentations and much more 
As was the case at the BMO Global Metals   Mining Conference a week earlier  one of the dominant thoughts on everyone s minds was Barrick Gold s  17 8 billion hostile take over of its longtime rival Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  
This Monday we learned that  after both parties spoke with top shareholders  the bid fell through  But rather than continuing to duke it out in the capital markets  the two mining giants will instead be entering into a joint venture  JV  in Nevada  The JV will combine significant deposits and mines  processing facilities and infrastructure to unlock significant synergies 
As a standalone company  the Nevada complex will be the world s single largest gold producing operations  according to equity research firm GMP Securities 
Nevada  by the way  is the top gold producing state in the U S   responsible for nearly three quarters of annual output  If it were its own country  Nevada would be the fourth largest gold producer in the world  thanks to its prolific Carlin Trend deposits 
It s within these monumental goldfields that the Barrick Newmont JV will be operating  with control over as many as three Tier 1 mines  or those that typically produce 500 000 ounces of gold or more annually  That is significant 
The JV ownership will be 61 5 percent Barrick and 38 5 percent Newmont  with Barrick acting as the main operator  The board will consist of three Barrick representatives and two Newmont representatives 
The  Walmart  of the Mining World
What s really exciting  I think  is that the synergies are projected to come partly from optimized mining and processing and partly from a supply chain and indirect costs  The company is expected to become the  Walmart  NYSE WMT   of the mining world  with the muscle to negotiate better prices on tractors  haulers and other equipment  The synergies are estimated to help save as much as  500 million in the first five years alone  according to GMP  but I believe it could be much more than that 
It s hard not to see this as positive for the capital markets  The Barrick Newmont JV is about trying to drive down costs in order to sustain the overall production profiles of these two mega gold miners 
Gold Accounted for Half of World Exploration Budgets
The Barrick Newmont deal is just the latest in what I believe is an ongoing trend of industry consolidation as well as rising exploration budgets  Barrick purchased London based Randgold Resources  LON RRS  back in September  while Newmont is working on a merger with Goldcorp  Australia s Newcrest Mining just bought a majority interest in Imperial Metals  Red Chris copper and gold mine  located in British Columbia  Canada  and is now in the process of inking a  65 million JV deal with Greatland Gold 
I see these deals as a sign that miners anticipate a bull run in gold prices  Better to spend the money now when valuations are attractive rather than later when companies could be much more expensive  During the last bull market in gold prices  many mining executives ended up losing their jobs because they entered deals when valuations were overextended Exploration budgets are also finally starting to climb  another sign of increased confidence in future prices  According to S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Market Intelligence s just released  World Exploration Trends 2018   budgets increased for the second straight year in 2018 to  10 1 billion  Roughly half of that  or  4 85 billion  was spent on gold exploration Ready to Invest 
What all of this means is that now might be the time to consider investing in gold miners  In the years since the price of gold peaked in 2011  producers and explorers slashed budgets to keep their powder dry  We re finally starting to see them deploy some of that capital  It s not hard to make the case that they seem to be acting on the knowledge  or at least a strong hunch  that metal prices are set to head higher

116503,338018,SPGI,Energy Report  Upcoming OPEC Meeting In Focus,opinion,"The Energy Report March 15  2019
OPEC s Revenge
As OPEC heads into its March 17 18th OPEC  coalition  Joint Technical Committee and Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee  meeting in Baku  Azerbaijan  they are making it clear that they are considering an extension of OPEC production cuts but also warning the U S  not to think about instituting a NOPEC bill that would allow the government to sue the cartel  According to a Bloomberg report they would start a production war  call on every member to raise production to maximum capacity  causing a crash in oil prices  and continue to work to bring the shale oil producers to their knees 
Yet without a bill they plan on draining supply and driving the price of Brent oil basis back to  80 a barrel  tweet or no tweet  OPEC is still fuming about President Trump s last minute reversal on Iranian oil sanctions when he granted waivers  especially after OPEC and their partner in crime Russia  tried to appease the president by raising production  Now the gloves have come off and the cartel wants revenge and they are going to stay tighter and show that they will not be swayed by the U S  President 
OPEC is covering their tracks and they are making a case for even further cuts by lowering their demand estimate for crude oil  In their latest report  they lowered their 2019 demand forecast to 30 46 million barrels per day  130 000 bpd less than last month s forecast  OPEC is also calling on others to cut output and they will not be swayed from their production cut goals  despite evidence that their determinization will lead to a supply deficit in the near future 
In fact  that is exactly what the International Energy Agency  IEA  is predicting  The world is being led by U S  oil demand growth as we are the strongest economy on the globe  The IEA  according to Reuters  is saying that

 The Paris based IEA said the market could show a modest surplus in the first quarter of 2019 before flipping into a deficit in the second quarter by about 0 5 million bpd  
 At the same time   OPEC  production cuts have increased the spare capacity cushion  This is especially important now as economic sentiment is becoming more pessimistic and the global economy could be entering a vulnerable period   the IEA added  The agency said it was particularly concerned about a possible further decline in production in Venezuela  where output has stabilized at 1 2 million bpd in recent months  

What this means for traders is that the path of least resistance is still to the upside  We have talked about the lack of heavy oil  as well as other refining issues  which will make this turnaround season very challenging  We have not even touched on the fact that Iranian production is falling  yet Libyan production is rising  We have an unstable situation in Nigeria as well  so there is enough geopolitical risk to keep the market nervous  While there is no real risk to oil supply at this point  the market must also pay attention to Israel and Gaza 
Natural gas may have had its last blast of winter  I hope  The EIA yesterday reported a massive drop in supply  Market Watch reported that the U S  Energy Information Administration released Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas fell by 204 billion cubic feet for the week ended March 8  That was within the range of the 208 billion cubic feet decline expected by analysts polled by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  Total stocks now stand at 1 186 trillion cubic feet  down 359 billion cubic feet from a year ago and 569 billion below the five year average ",2019-03-15,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-031519-200398343,200398343

116523,338038,SPGI,UPDATE 1 G20 watchdog to study oil pricing agencies,news,"  Report being compiled by IOSCO  IEA  OPEC
   Part of G20 request to probe commodities markets
 
  Adds comments from Platts  Argus 
 LONDON  April 26  Reuters    Global securities watchdog
IOSCO will study transparency and governance at oil pricing
services such as Platts and Argus as part of broader G20 efforts
to limit speculation in commodities markets 
 The International Organisation of Securities Commissions 
which oversees most national securities agencies  said it would
present its findings to the finance ministers of the world s G20
leading industrialised nations in October 
  The report intends to inform the G20 on the influence and
impact that price reporting agencies have on price discovery for
various types of crude oil and in particular how this feeds into
financial markets  since many price reporting agency benchmarks
are used in exchange settlement prices   IOSCO said 
 It said the report was being compiled together with the
International Energy Agency  the International Energy Forum and
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
 Rising prices on energy and agricultural markets in recent
months have sparked sharp criticism from politicians in the
West  who say financial speculators are to blame for the spikes 
 Platts  which is part of U S  group McGraw Hill  has long
been the dominant force in oil price reporting  a role that has
been increasingly challenged by competitor Argus Media over the
past decade 
 Both Platts and Argus Media said they were aware of the
plans for the study 
 
 LESS OVERSIGHT THAN EXCHANGES
  We share IOSCO s interest in transparent and efficient
commodity markets  and we look forward to working with the task
force as it continues its review   Platts said  adding that its
Market on Close price assessment process already requires full
disclosure of the details of any bid  offer or transaction 
 Argus also said it welcomed the G20 study 
  The study is confirmation of the important role that the
price reporting agencies play in bringing transparency to the
oil markets  enabling trade to be conducted between industry
participants on a more equal basis to the ultimate benefit of
consumers   said Argus Chairman and CEO Adrian Binks 
 The two services assess prices for over the counter physical
crude and refined products markets around the globe  many of
which are used to price spot and long term oil sales contracts 
 There has long been less regulatory oversight of those

 NEW YORK  Sept 12  Reuters    U S  stocks fell in volatile
trading on Monday on concerns the euro zone s sovereign debt
crisis could undermine a global economic recovery  but a U S 
tech deal limited losses on the Nasdaq composite index 
 Wall Street oscillated between losses of more than 1
percent and a flat performance  with the declines spawned by
worries Moody s Investors Service would downgrade French banks
and by Greece s unresolved debt problems 
 Fears Europe s credit crisis would drag in U S  banks have
been pressuring financial stocks for months  sending shares of

1 8 percent and the financial index  off 1 2 percent 
  There s a lot of uncertainty with respect to Europe  and

116536,338051,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"S P Global  NYSE SPGI  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This independent ratings and analytics provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 61 billion  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 39  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for S P Global 
For S P Global  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 46  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that S P Global will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that S P Global would post earnings of  2 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering a surprise of  4 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
S P Global doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-global-spgi-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200381946,200381946

S P Global  which belongs to the Zacks Business   Information Services industry  posted revenues of  1 54 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 35   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 59 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters

S P Global shares have added about 13 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9  
What s Next for S P Global 
While S P Global has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for S P Global was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

116543,338058,SPGI,US business leaders say hobbled by healthcare costs,news," Executives say healthcare overhaul urgently needed
  Other countries better able to survive economic storm
 By Donna Smith
 WASHINGTON  March 12  Reuters    U S  business leaders
urged lawmakers on Thursday to act quickly on healthcare
reform  saying American companies were losing out to other
countries with cheaper healthcare and healthier workers 
 The Business Roundtable  which represents the largest U S 
corporations  released a study showing that for every  100
spent in the United States on healthcare  a group of five
leading economic competitors    Canada  Japan  Germany  the
United Kingdom and France    spend about 63 cents 
  While today s economic challenges span the globe 
companies in other countries may be better able to weather the
storm in part because the value that their healthcare systems
deliver   Business Roundtable Chairman Harold McGraw told
reporters in a telephone conference  McGraw is chairman 
president and chief executive of The McGraw Hill Companies 
 U S  President Barack Obama has made reforming the
expensive and inefficient U S  healthcare system one of his top
priorities and Democratic leaders in Congress hope to get a
bill to him by the end of the year 
 The United States spends more on healthcare than any other
country  but some 46 million Americans are still uninsured 
 Ivan Seidenberg  chairman and chief executive of Verizon
Communications  said an overhaul of the U S  healthcare system
 should have been done yesterday  
 The United States  where most workers get healthcare
insurance through their employers  faces an even bigger
competitive disadvantage against rising economic powers Brazil 
India and China  the Business Roundtable study said 
 It said those countries spend about 15 cents on healthcare
for every dollar spent in America 
 BOILING FROG
  This is a boiling frog issue    how long can you stay in
the water before you get boiled to death   Seidenberg said 
 We re looking at close to double digit increases in healthcare
costs going into the future  
 The Business Roundtable executives said their study showed
that despite the money Americans spend on healthcare  U S 
workers are less healthy than workers in other countries 
putting U S  firms an an even greater disadvantage 
 The group wants changes that would reduce costs through
greater use of technology and other efficiencies and require
everyone to obtain health coverage    echoing proposals made by
the Obama administration 
 They support plans to provide government aid to help those
who cannot afford insurance  but said they do not want to see a
government insurance plan that  dominates the market  
 Most Americans    170 million    get health insurance
through an employer  although some buy their own private
insurance  Business Roundtable members provide health coverage

116546,338061,SPGI,Business Books  Managing cultures in a flat world,news,"By Scott Malone
 BOSTON  July 2  Reuters    In boardrooms across the world 
executives speak a common language  wear similar suits and peck
at the same model of BlackBerry 
 But under the surface lurk deep cultural differences that
separate people from different countries and backgrounds 
 People who work in virtual teams  dispersed in far flung
offices and relying on e mail and telephone for communication 
face an even greater challenge 
 Bridging these divides is the subject of two new books 
 Managing Across Cultures   McGraw Hill   34 95   published in
April  and  How to Manage in a Flat World   FT Press   24 99  
a U S  edition first published in Britain in 2007 
 Catching cultural clues is harder than it appears and  once
caught  difficult to overcome  both books say 
  The distinguishing characteristics of deeply held beliefs
are often invisible   warn Charlene Solomon and Michael Schell
in  Managing Across Cultures  
 This is even true when a group of people are speaking the
same language 
  Beware  where English is spoken well or is the mother
tongue  much can still get  lost in translation   because the
assumption is  we all understand one another    write Susan
Bloch and Philip Whiteley in  How to Manage in a Flat World  
 Both books hit on the need to adjust to different styles of
handling meetings  The amount of time    and conversation   
that it takes to develop trust in another person before getting
down to business can vary widely 
  It s like some people before they go up to hit a golf ball
need to go and practice their swing a little bit   Schell said
in an interview  If you tell them to go up to the tee and hit
the ball without a practice swing  they won t do it very well 
he said 
 WORLDLY WIZARDS
 Executives can more easily accept cultural differences in
colleagues and employees if they take the time to assess their
own cultural biases  say Solomon and Schell 
 They sketch out a system they call the  Culture Wizard 
model  which evaluates people based on seven cultural
preferences  ranging from how respectful they are of
hierarchical structures to how important it is to them to hit
deadlines and adhere to strict schedules 
 After taking a 31 question quiz that rates readers on these
seven values  the book walks through case studies showing
cultural pitfalls companies face 
 Among them are a look at Wal Mart Stores Inc  s
unsuccessful nine year German venture  which it closed in 2006 
The world s largest retailer discovered that its homey American
approach did not appeal to taciturn Teutonics  For instance 
many young women entering the stores thought that Wal Mart s
smiling  greeters  were flirting with them 
 They also chronicle how cultural differences doomed the
1998 merger of Detroit automaker Chrysler with Germany s
Daimler Benz  U S  executives  who focused on constantly
updating car designs to drive new sales  were at loggerheads
with German officials  whose focus was making near perfect cars
for buyers who expected to drive them for a decade 
 TAMING TEAMS
 In  How to Manage in a Flat World   Bloch and Whiteley
focus on the challenge of managing teams of workers who are
separated by time zones and culture 
 Among their ten tips are the importance of building trust
   and the role played by seemingly casual conversation    and
being ready for culture differences  including people who are
less reflexively respectful of authority 
  The pace of change in the flat world has killed off the
centrally controlled corporate structure   Bloch and Whiteley
write   It is cumbersome  clumsy and slows down
decision making  
 Instead  they argue that a smart manager gives his or her
employees a clear definition of their responsibilities and
authority and then steps back  which leads to their maxim   The
paradox in management is that people want to be free    and
led

 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    U S  stocks slid on Tuesday 
retreating after initial  earnings fueled gains were
overshadowed by cautious comments on the economic outlook from
company executives and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke 
 Stock indexes opened higher after better than expected
results from Dow components  including  Caterpillar Inc and
Merck   Co  but companies warned of challenges headed into the
third quarter  a cautious note that Bernanke echoed in
Congressional testimony 
 Shares of Caterpillar  up 5 6 percent to  38 72  were still
the Dow s strongest  but were far off the day s highs after the

profit and lowered its 2009 forecast  The company s chief
financial officer said cost cutting will lead to profit growth 
but  we do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in
2010  
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in testimony to a U S  House
committee that job insecurity plus declines in home values and
tight credit are likely to limit gains in consumer spending   
a major driver of the U S  economy 
  What we re seeing today is a combination of markets
focusing on two things  the caution from companies  and the
remaining hurdles the economy must work through before it
reaches recovery   said Subodh Kumar  chief investment
strategist at Subodh Kumar   Associates in Toronto

 NEW YORK  July 21  Reuters    The Dow rose on Tuesday as a
solid profit from Caterpillar Inc eclipsed unease about the
company s outlook for the current quarter  while both the
Nasdaq and the S P 500 clung to tiny gains after a round of
profit taking 
 Trading was choppy  with the broader market initially
charging higher after the open and the benchmark S P 500
hitting a fresh 2009 intraday high as it extended its rebound
from the 12 year lows of early March 
 Heading into Tuesday s session  investors were encouraged
by another round of strong profit reports from major
bellwethers that included drugmaker Merck   Co  but that
optimism was met with a dose of reality when heavy equipment
maker Caterpillar warned the current quarter could be tough

 At the end of last year  there was a particularly sharp downgrade in expectations for the US   says Goldman Sach s Peter Oppenheimer   While there has been a big tightening of policy and financial conditions in the US  we don t see a recession  but we do see a pretty sharp slowdown   adding that markets had  got too far into pricing a deeper downturn than we expect  
Projecting the one year trend for GDP for the year ahead aligns with Goldman s outlook  The chart below shows the average forecast for year over year changes in output  based on the average estimate via nine models  The main takeaway  US economic activity peaked last year and is set to slow in 2019   a forecast that s been a staple for The Capital Spectator for several months   see here  for instance 

Monitoring the US economy in the weeks and perhaps months ahead could be challenging  however  due to the partial government shutdown  There s never a good time to go dark with economic releases  but the current environment of softer growth threatens to be especially problematic for playing the guessing games on the US macro trend  Challenging or not  there s no sign that the shutdown will end soon  which means that several key numbers in the coming days will remain a mystery  including tomorrow s scheduled release of retail sales figures for December 
Using the numbers published to date  however  suggests that retail spending s trend is set to pick up  The Capital Spectator s estimate for the annual change in December  based on the average estimate of nine models  calls for a modestly firmer increase of 4 4  from 4 2  through November 

But with the Census Bureau closed  tomorrow s retail sales data will remain a mystery until some unknown date in the future 
Then again  perhaps the retail data  along with Thursday s scheduled release of housing starts  will slip out  Bob Dieli  an economist who runs the No Spin Forecast consultancy  tells The Capital Spectator that  the stories that I have seen so far have made it sound as though the Census Bureau has some wiggle room  If I had to guess  I would say they would like to do retail sales because of its profile  along with housing starts and GDP  
Meantime  the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  is still open and publishing data  According to a press release on the BLS web site   the January 2019 Employment Situation will be published as scheduled on February 1  2019  
Missing data is only part of the problem  A bigger issue is the self inflicted economic damage that the partial shutdown will unleash if the political stalemate rolls on 
 How big a jolt a shutdown causes the economy depends on how long the government is closed   S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings advised on Friday   While not in our estimate  we expect that the weekly costs will widen beyond the average weekly cost of  1 2 billion as the shutdown ages  

The longer this shutdown drags on  the more collateral damage the economy will suffer  Ironically  based on our analysis  it will only take another two weeks before the cost of the shutdown would be more than the  5 7 billion requested for the proposed southern wall ",2019-01-15,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-gdp-growth-remains-set-for-moderate-slowdown-in-q4-200375528,200375528
116566,338081,SPGI,U S  Government Shuts Down  Will Gold Go Up ,opinion,"Federal government shutdown drags into its fourth week  Will it boost gold prices 
US Government Shuts Down  Again
Could you imagine life without a government  Now  you can  The federal government has been shut down since December 22nd  2018  The government shutdown does not  of course  imply that the whole government is closed  Only non essential discretionary federal programs and agencies close  They include NASA  IRS  Department of Commerce  Department of Education  Department of Labor  Food and Drug Administration  etc 
The partial shutdown occurred because President Donald Trump and the United States did not agree on the appropriation of funds for the 2019 fiscal year  The bone of contention is Trump s call for more than  5 billion for a U S  Mexico border wall  Democrats  who now control the House of Representatives  have rejected Trump s demand  claiming that there are more effective ways of enhancing border security than building a wall costing more than  25 billion  They also point out that Trump promised during his campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall  however  its government has refused  what a surprise  
The shutdown of the US government is not something new  For example  it happened in January 2018 for three days  2013 for 16 days in  or in 1995 1996 for 21 days  The current shutdown is the longest in the US history  lasting 25 days already 
Government Shutdown and US Economy
What the government shutdown imply for the US economy and the gold market  Well  it resulted in a lack of funding for nine executive departments  affecting about one fourth of government activities with around 800 000 employees  Almost half of them have been furloughed  i e  sent home without pay  while the rest of them have to work without a paycheck  More importantly  the shutdown also affects the pace of economic growth  as the government spending is a component of GDP  Indeed  the shutdown in 2013 reduced the GDP by 0 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013  On that basis  the J P  Morgan economists have cut their first quarter growth forecast by a quarter point to 2 percent  Gold should enjoy the economic slowdown 
And  according to the S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings  the shutdown imply a decrease in sales for contractors to the government  delays in federal loans  and reduced consumer spending and lost productivity by furloughed workers  Hence  the company estimate costs of shutdown at  1 2 billion for every week the government is closed  We are a bit skeptical  but if true  the cost of the shutdown will exceed soon the  5 billion Trump has demanded for the wall  Is that not funny 
Implications for Gold
So far  we have not seen any impressive rally in gold amid the US government shutdown  We mean that  of course  gold shined in January  but it still cannot cross the level of  1 300  as the chart below shows 
Chart 1  Gold prices from January 13 to January 15  2019 

One can convincingly argue that the longer this shutdown lasts  the more collateral damage the economy will suffer  and the brighter gold will shine  However  this is not what history suggests  For example  the government shutdown in 2013 did not provide a boost for gold prices  Similarly  in January 2018  gold prices declined between January 20th and 23rd  and went up only when the shutdown ended  as one can see in the chart below 
Chart 2  Gold prices during government shutdown in January 20 23  2018

Actually  the lack of meaningless gold s reaction is quite understandable  The government shutdown is not a big deal  as government still provides essential services  And the shutdown will eventually be resolved  Come on  do you really think that the US economy will collapse because the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are closed  Hence  any potential impact on gold should be limited and short term  Unless  of course  there is a protracted shutdown  Anyway  the nearest days may be quite hot for the gold market  as today there is a vote in British Parliament on May s deal  Stay tuned 

Disclaimer  Please note that the aim of the above analysis is to discuss the likely long term impact of the featured phenomenon on the price of gold and this analysis does not indicate  nor does it aim to do so  whether gold is likely to move higher or lower in the short  or medium term  In order to determine the latter  many additional factors need to be considered  i e  sentiment  chart patterns  cycles  indicators  ratios  self similar patterns and more  and we are taking them into account  and discussing the short  and medium term outlook  in our trading alerts ",2019-01-15,Arkadiusz Sieron,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-government-shuts-down-will-gold-go-up-200375536,200375536

release showed a bigger than expected decrease in natural gas supplies  While prices jumped following the storage withdrawal  the drawdown was well below average  which further reduced the storage deficit  Mixed EIA Inventory DataStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 81 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Jan 11  above the guidance  of 77 Bcf decline  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts  However  the decrease was significantly lower than both the five year  2014 2018  average net shrinkage of 218 Bcf and last year s drop of 208 Bcf for the reported week Following past week s supply decline  at 2 533 trillion cubic feet  Tcf   natural gas inventories are 327 Bcf  11 4   under the five year average and 77 Bcf  3   below the year ago figure Fundamentally speaking  total supply of natural gas averaged around 94 4 Bcf per day  up 1  on a weekly basis as dry production edged up  Meanwhile  daily consumption rose 18  to 97 2 Bcf thanks to stronger power generation and residential sector demand amid colder weather Wild Ride for the Heating FuelWhile natural gas has rallied around 20  over the past fortnight  it s still 30  below the four year high of  4 929 per MMBtu reached in mid November  The early onset of winter  together with the lowest level of stocks in 15 years and demand from power plants and growing LNG shipments lifted the commodity to its highest level since November 2014 But the euphoria didn t last long as mild weather in December and early January led to smaller withdrawals that markedly reduced the storage deficit and sent prices lower What Lies Ahead The fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  The demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price has catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 35   from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico  together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities have meant that exports out of the U S  are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure strong natural gas demand   However  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand  Therefore  prices are likely to trade sideways unless colder than normal weather returns during the rest of the winter Want to Own a Natural Gas Stock Now The uncertain natural gas fundamentals  considering its seasonal nature  is responsible for the understandable reluctance on

116573,338088,SPGI,ETF Winners   Losers In One Month Long Government Shutdown  ,opinion,"It s been more than one month that the U S  government has been shut down    officially the longest on record  A deadlock in passing a spending bill  wherein Trump demanded funding for  5 6 billion for a border wall that is being opposed by the Democrats  is mainly the reason for the shutdown 
Shutdowns normally lower the economy s productive work hours and revenues  Private sector companies that deal with the government are likely to have their works halted for the time being  As many as 800 000 federal workers are furloughed  which means consumption could be hit  If it runs through Friday  then economic loss would be   per S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings predicts 
Trump advisor  says the partial government shutdown could hurt first quarter GDP growth but also noted that the economy will recover immediately  The White House now expects the funding delay to reduce  every week it lasts

116574,338089,SPGI,Oil Outlook Favoring The Bullish Side,opinion,"Shale Storm
Shale oil producers are still trying to ride out the oil storm but there will be cruel cuts by U S  shale producers  The false narrative that U S  shale producers are immune to sharp drops in the price of oil has been proven wrong time and time again 
Shale oil producers raising output by record numbers were caught wrong footed by President Trump s waiver of sanctions on Iran  The ensuing oil price crash hurt many of those companies and now is having consequences for expectations of U S  shale oil output  Not only have we seen the U S  oil rig count continue to trend lower  but CapX cuts in the sector are coming and it is already starting to impact U S  oil production negatively  On Friday  Baker Hughes reported the biggest one week drop in oil rigs in three years and the FT reports that the number of rigs drilling oil wells in the U S  has already dropped by about 8 percent since November to 889  according to S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts Analytics 
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported Tuesday it expects U S  shale production to rise by just 63 000 barrels a day in February  the lowest growth rate in nine months according to the Wall Street Journal  The FT reports that the EIA has forecast that between December 2018 and December 2019  U S  crude production will rise by about 500 000 barrels a day  That would represent a sharp slowdown from growth of 1 8m b d over the previous 12 months 
This comes as the FT reports that  Capital raising by U S  oil exploration and production companies has fallen sharply following the decline in crude prices that began last October  pointing to cutbacks in capital spending budgets and a continuing slowdown in activity   The FT says that  Companies in the sector have not held a single bond sale since the start of November  according to Dealogic  while share sales have also slowed   The data suggest that after a record breaking boom in U S  oil output in 2018  growth will be weaker this year 
The truth is that many shale companies are saddled with debt and rely on debt to grow production  Lenders and investors are leery of lending many shale operations money when they still must prove that they can make money 
OPEC wants to prove they can make money and reduce the oil glut at the same time  OPEC is ahead of schedule with their cuts as their production fell by 751 000 barrels per day  bpd  in December to 31 58 million bpd  the biggest month on month drop in almost two years  OPEC pledged  along with Russia  to cut by 1 2 million bpd  of which OPEC s share is 800 000 bpd 
Of course  this all hinges on whether the global economy falls apart  We saw both doom and gloom coming out of Davos  Talk of slowdown fears are making the rounds  Yet the good part of that is that global central bankers will move towards more accommodation in policies allowing for oil demand to continue to grow  The oil demand slowdown to this point has been minuscule and with shale producers cutting back and OPEC cuts going full force  the outlook is favoring the bullish side 
Natural gas pulls back as record production is offsetting the winter demand surge  While you may not feel it  the natural gas market is seeing signs of spring with a very well supplied market ",2019-01-23,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-012319-200378236,200378236

The global capital markets are consolidating ahead of this week s big events  which include the FOMC meeting  U S  jobs  an important Brexit vote in the U K  parliament and the first look at Q4 EMU and U S  GDP  The U S  dollar is narrowly mixed  Equities are mostly lower  European benchmark 10 year yields have edged up  though the U S  10 year yield is struggling to hold above 2 75   The U S  government will re open after the longest partial shutdown in history  but the agreement only covers through February 15  leaving open the possibility of another closure if a deal is not struck  Crude oil is trading heavily with the front month Brent and WTI off nearly 2   The March WTI contract has remained in a  50  55 trading range for the past three weeks  Gold moved above  1300 an ounce for the first time since last June  It recorded an outside up week by trading on both sides of the previous week s range and closing above that high  Technical considerations suggest that there may be upside near term 
Asia Pacific
The week has begun slowly  and Australian markets were closed for a national holiday  Ahead of the trade talks in Washington starting later this week  the PBOC announced that it had approved S P Global  NYSE SPGI  into China s credit rating market  Other international credit rating companies hope China makes good on its pledge to allow additional foreign rating agencies to operate domestically  Separately  China reported that industrial profit fell  1 7  year over year in December   Last December  they had risen  10 8   and is consistent with the economic slowdown and challenges the country faces 
After contracting in Q3  Japan s economic recovery in Q4 appears spotty and uneven  This week Japan is expected to report that industrial output fell for the second month in December  On the other hand  household demand may have improved  and retail sales are expected to have bounced back after a sharp 1  decline in November  Australia reports Q4 CPI figures tomorrow  and softer price pressures may weaken the currency  as investors appear to have begun discounting a rate cut  China s official PMI is expected later this week 
The dollar is trading within last week s range   JPY109 15 JPY110 00  against the Japanese yen  Two maturing options may be in play in the North American session  There is one for about  600 mln at JPY109 20 and another for around  535 mln at JPY109 55  The Australian dollar posted a potential upside reversal at the end of last week  but follow through buying stalled near  0 7200  Resistance is seen in the  0 7220  0 7235 area  The New Zealand dollar is seeing stronger buying that the Aussie after the pre weekend gains  It reached new highs for the month near  0 6870  The dollar lurched lower against the Chinese yuan before the weekend and fell further during the mainland session today  after gapping lower  It reached almost CNY6 7225  its lowest level since last July  The greenback closed off its lows  and we suspect officials do not want to see it below CNY6 70 
Europe
Brexit developments are front and center  The House of Commons is set to vote tomorrow  There is a bill that will give more control to Parliament if there is government cannot find a majority to support its plan  May could be forced to seek an extension if no agreement is found by February 26  The government wants to renegotiate the backstop with the EC  This latter path looks blocked by the EC and Ireland 
One area that the U K  seeks cooperation with Germany and France is over the U S  sanctions against Iran  There has been talk for a few months now that they could organize a special purpose vehicle that would facilitate trading with Iran ostensible without risking U S  sanctions as the SPV will not operate in the US  There are reports that an announcement could be made shortly  The U S  is unlikely to accept this end run around its embargo without a protest of some kind 
The ECB took unprecedented action last week in changing its risk assessment without the cover of new staff forecasts  The way in which Draghi has referred to Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations  TLTRO  suggest a consensus is emerging for a new round of long term loans  However  today s money supply data suggests the monetary conditions are stronger than the real sector  where German manufacturing PMI slipped below 50  and Italy is expected to report the economy contracted in Q4 for the second consecutive quarter  Money supply  M3 growth  accelerated to 4 1  from 3 1   while lending to households and non financial business remained firm 
The euro extended its pre weekend gains  but the momentum faded in front of  1 1430  the 50  retracement of the decline from the spike higher earlier this month to  1 1575 to the Draghi inspired lows last week  a little below  1 1300  The next retracement objective is near  1 1465  The 20 day moving average is found near  1 1415  and the single currency has not closed above it for two weeks  The session low  so far is  1 1390  just above the  1 1380 level were 745 mln euros are stuck in an option that expires today  Sterling has been unable to build on its pre weekend gains  but it remains firm and continues to straddle the  1 32 level  That said  bids near  1 3150 appear sufficient  and another run at the highs looks likely

The re opening of the U S  government should allow a resumption of economic data reports  However  today s Chicago and Dallas Fed reports were not impacted by the partial government shutdown  Moreover  the key economic reports this week  the first look at Q4 GDP  a few hours before the conclusion of the FOMC meeting  and the January jobs data are also not impacted by the political theater  The FOMC will keep rates steady  and Powell may provide some more color on the Fed s balance sheet  which had captured the market s attention when the stocks cratered in December  The Fed s rhetoric may have shifted  patient and flexible   but its actions have not changed  The balance sheet continues to shrink slowly  and the S P 500 is up 6 3  this month  recouping 2 3 of the December decline  Economists expect that the U S  economy expanded around 2 5  in Q4  after 3 4  growth in Q3 and 4 2  in Q2  Trend growth is thought to be a little less than 2  
U S  and China trade talks resume this week  The basis for an agreement has been well publicized  China agrees to buy more U S  goods  especially foodstuffs and energy  and agree to stop improper technology transfers  with some verification and enforcement mechanism  There is unlikely to be much progress on getting China to cut its aid to industry  Although many observers cry foul over the state s involvement in the Chinese economy  the fact that the US housing sector  accounting for more than 10  of GDP  remains nationalized a decade after the financial crisis has ended  is seen as more acceptable  Both the US and China will likely have constructive things to say about the talks  but neither a breakthrough nor a collapse should be expected  The most that can be expected is an indication of future talks ahead of the early March deadline 
The U S  dollar has stabilized after falling sharply against the Canadian dollar at the end of last week  Initial support is holding near CAD1 3200  The low from earlier this month was near CAD1 3180  The greenback found support last week near MXN18 88  It has tested the MXN19 05 area today  and there is potential toward MXN19 15  but the high yields continue to draw funds  Meanwhile  the U S  Dollar Index held support near 95 65  A move back above 96 00 is needed to lift the tone ",2019-01-28,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/getting-ducks-lined-up-for-later-in-the-week-200379883,200379883

116613,338128,SPGI,Ignore The Market Crash  Here Are Real Signs To Sell A CEF,opinion,"With market volatility kicking into high gear  now is the perfect time to talk about one of the biggest questions CEF investors face  How do you know when it s time to sell a closed end fund  CEF  
Unfortunately  there s no simple answer to that question and often investors who use conventional sell signals  like a falling market price  will end up selling at the worst time 
That leads me to my cardinal rule with CEFs  It s easier to know when to buy than when to sell  If the fund is well managed  has a strong track record  is deeply discounted and has a relatively safe dividend  it s generally a screaming buy  Signs to sell aren t always so obvious  but they are still there  You just need to know what to look for 
With that in mind  here are three key points to consider when deciding whether to sell a CEF 
No  1  The Premium is Too High
The first clue that it s time to sell a CEF is the most obvious  When the fund is overbought  it s time to dump it 
For instance  take the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust  NYSE BGY   which I recommended in March 2017  I chose BGY at that time because its discount had suddenly widened  despite the fact that changes in its portfolio indicated it was well positioned to surge 
The fund did this over the following eight months 
A Fast 20  Return
A big reason for this return  BGY s unusually large discount of 12  in March steadily closed to a more normal 6 7  in November  when I urged subscribers to sell 
After my sell call  the fund did this 
A Steady Drop
The lesson  Keep track of the discount  and when it gets too narrow  or becomes a premium  relative to its historical average  it s time to get out of this crowded trade 
No  2  Pressure on an Entire Sector
Sometimes some outside force will pressure the type of assets the fund invests in  When this happens  sell as fast as possible 
The great thing about CEFs is that  in large part because of their small size and retail investor base  they react more slowly and over a longer period to bad news than more popular ETFs  This means anyone who keeps up with the news and invests in CEFs has more leeway to respond to the market and sell 
A clear example of this happened with a municipal bond fund in late 2017  the Invesco Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust  NYSE VPV  
I recommended this fund to in March 2017 for familiar reasons  a great and reliable dividend yield  strong management and an unusually big discount  The fund delivered over the next few months  even outperforming the municipal bond index ETF that tracks VPV s benchmark 
Cheap VPV Beats the  Dumb  Index Fund
Then a major news event happened in September 2017 that prompted me to release a sell alert  S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Ratings downgraded Pennsylvania s bonds  and the state did not immediately respond to the market s concerns 
The combination of a downgrade and lawmakers  refusal to address it was a crystal clear sell signal  VPV did this in the five months after we unloaded it 
VPV Takes a Fast Dive
For a municipal bond fund  this is a big move in a short time  And all it took to avoid this short term pain was to follow the news and react in a timely way 
No  3  Get Defensive in a Bear Market
My third point is something that hasn t yet happened since we launched CEF Insider  although I do believe it is a couple of years away  a recession and bear market 
Every investor dreams of avoiding plunges like 2008 09  No one can steer clear of losses all the time  of course 
The key is to keep a watchful eye for four economic warning signs  rising unemployment  slower wage growth and  consumer spending and  above all  the so called  inverted yield curve   That s when the spread between 2 year and 10 year Treasury yields go negative  in the past  it s correctly indicated a recession within the following 12 months 
Below the Black Line Means Danger Ahead
The financial press has spilled a lot of ink about the inverted yield curve recently because in the last year it s tanked to its lowest point since just before the 2008 09 meltdown 
We haven t seen an inverted yield curve yet  When we do  it s time to emphasize defensive CEF sectors  especially if it s accompanied by rising unemployment and falling wages  The appearance of an inverted yield curve is also a very good time to prune weaker CEFs from your holdings  such as those with flaws like the ones I showed you in points 1 and 2 
Fortunately  we re not in this situation now  Incomes are rising at an accelerating pace and unemployment remains below 4   But I ll keep a close eye on all the vital economic numbers 
My Top 5 Buys for 28  Returns  and 8  Dividends  in 2019
Right now I m pounding the table on 5 CEFs trading at such ridiculous discounts made even more ridiculous due to the selloff that they re  spring loaded  for 20   gains in 2019  as these bizarre markdowns  inevitably  snap back to normal 
That s not all  though 
Because my top 5 CEFs for 2019 also pay 8  average dividends as I write  Tack that onto our expected 20  gain and we re looking at a 28  total return by the end of 2019 
Now with the way the markets have been behaving lately  I know what you re going to say next   Michael  what happens to these 5 funds if the market tanks in 2019  
That s the best part 
Unbeatable Nest Egg Protection
You see  my top 5 funds  huge discounts also let us sleep well at night  Because if the market falls on its face next year which  as I just mentioned  is the opposite of what I expect these funds are already dirt cheap  so they ll have plenty of built in downside protection   and we ll still collect their 8  average dividends 
These are exactly the kinds of investments you need in times like this when the Dow regularly drops 2  or more in a single day

116614,338129,SPGI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Unit  Black Stone Minerals  Bonanza Creek Energy  Par Pacific And Suburban Propane Partners,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   January 10  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Unit Corp    NYSE UNT    Black Stone Minerals  L P    NYSE BSM    Bonanza Creek Energy  Inc    NYSE BCEI    Par Pacific Holdings  Inc    NYSE PARR   and Suburban Propane Partners  L P    NYSE SPH   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
Oil Posts Longest Winning Streak in More than a Year  5 Picks
On Jan 8  oil futures closed in the green for the second straight session  marking the longest stretch of gains in nearly 18 months  OPEC s decision to reduce supplies by 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  during the first six months of 2019 is the major factor on the supply side boosting prices  The cartel s oil production declined to a six month low in December  per a fresh S P Global  NYSE SPGI  Platts survey 
A confluence of factors on the demand side is also lending support to crude prices  This includes Jan 4 s exceptional jobs report  which has reassured investors about the strength of the U S  economy 
Meanwhile  the Fed Chair struck a dovish tone in his comments last week  seeking to assuage markets  Progress on the trade talks  front has added to bullish sentiment  This is why it makes sense to bet on oil stocks in 2019 
Prices Seal 18 Month Long Streak of Gains
On Jan 8  WTI Crude for February delivery increased 2 6  or  1 26 to  49 78 a barrel  This is the highest level recorded for a monthly forward contract since Dec 17  per data from Dow Jones Market 
Significantly  this marks the longest stretch of gains since the eight session winning streak  which ended on Jul 3  2017  Meanwhile  March Brent crude advanced 1 4  or  1 39 to  58 72 a barrel  This also marks its longest winning streak in around 18 months 
OPEC s December Output Plummets  Saudi Arabia Plans Further Cuts
Analysts think that OPEC s decision to reduce output by 1 2 million barrels per day during the first six months of this year is primary supply side factor fueling the recent crude rally  Meanwhile  a survey released by S P Global Platts revealed that OPEC output had declined to a six month low in December 
Additionally  Saudi Arabia is looking to reduce crude exports to nearly 7 1 million bpd by the end of this month  per a Wall Street Journal report released on Jan 7  OPEC officials revealed that this is an attempt to boost prices above the  80 a barrel mark 
Demand Side Factors Also Likely to Support Prices
Several demand side factors are also likely to support crude prices in the months ahead  Negotiations between top U S  and Chinese officials entered its second day on Jan 8  A successful deal would go a long way toward supporting oil prices since China is a major importer of crude 
Meanwhile  Jan 4 s bullish jobs report has dispelled concerns about the U S  economy  Investors are currently looking to ignore speculation over a near term recession  The Fed Chair s recent market friendly comments have also served to boost optimism 
Our Choices
Crude prices have started the year on a particularly strong note  While analysts attribute the recent rise to OPEC s fresh production cuts  other factors are also at play  A resolution to the U S  China trade conflict could reassure investors about demand in the medium term 
Strong jobs data and the Fed Chair s recent supportive posture are other demand side forces supporting crude prices at this point  Taken together  these factors make oil an excellent investment in 2019  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult

116728,338243,SPGI,7 GARP Stocks That Should Find A Place In Your Portfolio,opinion,If you re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing  try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy  It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects However  one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy  While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks  GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section  we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  to make the strategy foolproof Zacks Rank less than or equal to

ROE  over the past 12 months  greater than the industry average  Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  P E and P B ratios less than X industry average  P E and P B

in any of the trailing four quarters The company s third quarter 2017 results reflect higher revenues and benefits from rising rates  It remains well positioned to gain from the rising rate environment  Also  initiatives to strengthen trading income are likely to support its profitability in the long run despite the near term reduction in the same However  a continuous rise in expenses

116874,338389,SPGI,3 Business Services Stocks Likely To Top Q3 Earnings,opinion,"The U S  economy is expected to continue its upward trajectory with a GDP growth in the vicinity of 3  in the third quarter of 2016  after a seasonally adjusted subdued 1  rise in the first half of the year  Allaying fears of a near term recession  the domestic equity market gradually picked up steam buoyed by firm consumer spending  stronger exports and positive business investment 

Encouraging labor market data and rising oil prices have further raised hopes of a rate hike this year  However  uncertainties related to the approaching presidential elections have somewhat marred the euphoria 
The Positive Feelers

The upturn was led by positive economic data that showed a rapid improvement in the U S  manufacturing activity in September  as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management increased to 51 5 from 49 4 in August 

On an average  there were 192 000 job additions per month in the third quarter  The unemployment rate rose marginally to 5  in September from 4 9  in the previous month due to a higher participation rate of 62 9  as more people looked for work   a clear indication that the economy is indeed improving 

Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market  low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills  consumer confidence remained strong  The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved to 104 1 in September from 101 8 in August  Consumer spending  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economy  is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 3  for the year as the consumers remain cautiously optimistic 

The Markit Composite Purchasing Managers Index data improved to 52 3 in September from 51 0 in August  This represents a general uptrend in new business growth and a cautious spending pattern of clients 

As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action  let us take a glimpse into how the third quarter earnings is shaping up so far for the business services sector 
Business Services Sector Performance

About 17 4  of the total S P 500 companies in the Business Services sector have reported their earnings results through Oct 19  2016  With a  beat ratio  of 100 0   total earnings for these companies are up 17 4  year over year  Revenues increased 8 0  compared with the year ago period  with a  beat ratio  of 100 0  

The entire Business Services sector is expected to perform far better than the overall index  The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 7 3  as against a decline of 1 0  for the S P 500 index   Read   

The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects for job growth  higher disposable income and new business initiatives  An ideal mix of services  effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies 

Given the forecast  it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter  An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term 
How to Pick 

The Business Services sector covers an array of services that include marketing  consulting  staffing  security  telecommunications  Internet services  logistics and waste handling  Amid a diverse range of companies in this arena  picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task  An easy way to narrow down the list is to look at stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive  with the help of the  

Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement  The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

The combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  or  3  Hold  and a positive Earnings ESP is usually a harbinger of a likely earnings beat 

We have mentioned three Business Services stocks below which match these criteria  and thus may be potential winners this earnings season

116877,338392,SPGI,S P Global  SPGI  Beats Q1 Earnings  Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Maintaining its earnings beat streak for the 22nd straight quarter  S P Global  Inc    NYSE SPGI   reported first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of  1 62  comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 40 per share  It was also up 35  compared with the year earlier quarter tally of  1 20 per share 

Impressive bottom line growth came on the back of robust organic revenue growth  diligent expense control measures and strategic share repurchases 
Revenues for the quarter were  1 453 million compared with  1 341 million in the year ago quarter  Also  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 388 million  Top line growth was fuelled by outstanding performance of the company s Global Ratings segment  Also  impressive performance of the S P Dow Jones Indices business supplemented the growth 
Segmental Details
S P Global Ratings segment s revenues increased 29  year over year to  714 million  chiefly driven by increase in transaction revenues  The growth of transaction revenues came on the back of substantial increase in high yield bond  bank loan ratings and contract terms  Moreover  higher surveillance fees  entity fees and intersegment royalties from Market Intelligence and CRISIL drove non transaction revenue growth 
Adjusted operating profit jumped 50  to  379 million from the prior year quarter and adjusted operating profit margin increased 750 basis points to 53   Strong revenue growth proved conducive to both adjusted operating profit and margin growth 
S P Global Market and Commodities Intelligence revenues declined 10  year over year to  593 million  due to the sale of J D  Power  the SPSE CMA pricing businesses  and Equity and Fund Research last year  Also  the divesture of QuantHouse earlier this year proved to be a drag   In addition  the segment s adjusted operating profit fell 3  to  223 million 
However  the segment s adjusted operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 38   primarily driven by gains from divestments of lower margin businesses and strong organic revenue growth 
S P Dow Jones Indices revenues rose 14  to  115 million in the reported quarter  mainly attributable to growth in asset linked fees  Also  both adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin recorded year over year growth  While adjusted profit attributable to the company increased 14  to  85 million  adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points to 68  
Overall  S P Global s operating profit margin improved by 640 basis points to 45  and the adjusted operating profit margin improved by 630 basis points to 47    Strategic divesture of lower margin businesses  impressive organic revenue growth and productivity initiatives drove these improvements S P Global Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Financial Aspects
S P Global exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  2 411 million compared with  2 392 million at the end of Dec 31  2016  Long term debt was  3 565 million as of Mar 31  2017  compared with  3 564 million as of Dec 31  2016  During the first quarter of 2017  the company generated free cash flow from continuing operations of  306 million  a significant improvement over  136 million as of Dec 31  2016 
During the first quarter  the company returned  307 million to shareholders  This was done through a combination of share repurchases and dividend payouts  It paid out  106 million in dividends and bought 1 5 million shares for  201 million 
Outlook
Concurrent with the earnings release  S P Global hiked its full year 2017 revenue guidance  from flat to low single digit growth  Also  it has raised its guidance for adjusted EPS to  6 00  6 20 from the earlier  5 90  6 15 
To Conclude
S P Global started 2017 on an impressive note with notable top and bottom line beats  We believe that the company s strategic portfolio restructuring and focus on core business will continue to drive growth  going forward  This apart  strategic acquisitions and positive industry trends like surge of new high yield bonds and leveraged loans  fuelled by tight interest rate spreads  will continue to drive growth for the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company 
Other Stocks to Consider
Some other stocks worth considering in the industry are ABM Industries Incorporated   NYSE ABM    ManpowerGroup Inc    NYSE MAN   and TrueBlue  Inc    NYSE TBI    All three stocks carry the same Zacks Rank as S P Global  You can see  
ABM Industries has a decent earnings surprise history with an average positive surprise of 16 1  over the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through 
ManpowerGroup came up with three earnings beat in the trailing four quarters and has an average positive surprise of 4 5  
TrueBlue has an average positive surprise of 13 6  over the trailing four quarters  with three beats

116901,338416,SPGI,The Perfect Time To Short Facebook Again,opinion,"At some point  even the market s strongest companies and top gainers become attractive short selling targets 
And it s looking like the time to short might be coming  again  soon for Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB 
I realize that such a statement sounds nonsensical 
After all  the world s largest  just smashed analysts  first quarter expectations  posting revenue growth of more than 50  
And shares have rallied to a new all time high of  120 79   more than triple its IPO price in May 2012 
But I assure you that short selling opportunities regularly materialize   even in the market s hottest stocks 
Case in point  Monster Beverage Corp  NASDAQ MNST  
From 1995 to 2015  it was the best performing stock in the United States 
Yes  the entire market 
Shares soared by a staggering 105 000    enough to turn  10 000 into more than  10 million 
Of course  for  buy and hold  investors  those stats underscore the need to be willing to endure gut wrenching volatility without selling shares  trailing stops be damned     otherwise  those gains would be much lower 
As The Motley Fool s Morgan Housel notes   It suffered four separate drops of 50  or more  It lost more than two thirds of its value twice  and more than three quarters once  
But I digress  Let s talk about shorting Facebook 
Facebook Is Up Big  But It s Not Immune to Slumps  Either
Lest you think Monster was some abnormal example of monster volatility  think again 
As it turns out  the 10 best performing stocks over the last two decades all suffered multiple declines of 50  or more  according to  
So don t be fooled  Facebook s chart topping run doesn t immunize it against similar pullbacks 
While the company is up an impressive 210  from its IPO price  the run has already seen one 50  decline 
 By the way  our subscribers successfully played that downturn for a double digit gain  
And here s why I m convinced another one is coming  And more importantly  how to position your portfolio ahead of it at the right time 
Mobile Conquered
The last attractive time to short Facebook came right after its IPO in May 2012 
The company hit the market with enormous fanfare  with shares priced at  38 
But within the first 106 days of trading  the stock had plummeted by 53 8  to a low of  17 55 on September 4  2012 
And this wasn t simply the result of overhyped IPO expectations not meeting reality  Facebook had a real problem   mobile 
As you can see in the chart below  it didn t exist as a revenue source yet for the company 
And it doesn t take a genius to deduce that with the world going entirely mobile  if Facebook couldn t make the transition  its business   and  in turn  the stock   was doomed 
Needless to say  Facebook was well aware of this  Within a year  it had successfully started making the transition 
The rest is history  The company now generates nearly 80  of its sales via mobile advertising 
And the stock has responded in kind by consistently rallying to new highs  as the percentage of mobile revenue keeps climbing higher 

So what legitimate  fundamental issue is going to cause the next 50  plus plunge for Facebook 
Before I reveal the source  we first have to understand a core truth 
The Product Is NOT the Business
Facebook couldn t be more straightforward about its purpose  The company wants to help billions of people  connect and share  with the people in their lives 
It s what we ve come to define as a  social media network  
Pardon the Captain Obvious statement here  but an investment in Facebook is NOT an investment in some new school social media platform 
On the contrary  it s an investment in a decidedly old school business   advertising 
Long ago  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg confessed to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that the company had sold out its users in favor of advertisers 
It was quite an admission  But she recounts that early in her tenure  the top brass had a critical decision  to make either users or advertisers pay 
They chose the latter  As a result  the company is beholden to that group  Period  And such loyalty promises to topple the stock the next time an economic slowdown materializes 
Recessions Sink Advertisers
When times get tough  what s the first thing the average company cuts  Advertising 
Despite countless studies indicating that it s the worst decision   from highly respected publications like the Harvard Business Review  McGraw Hill  NYSE SPGI  and the North American Business Press   it still happens 
So when the next recession comes  Facebook s going to be in trouble 
Of course  I guarantee that many will argue that  this time will be different  because Facebook has become an integral part of everyone s everyday life 
Heck  The Reformed Broker s Joshua Brown points out that Facebook has become a    
He s got a point  The company s 1 65 billion users now spend an average of 50 minutes per day on its platforms 
And you can bet that during a recession  when unemployment increases  I m sure the time spent on Facebook will tick even higher 
That s what we do when we have extra time on our hands  We look for distractions 
But new religion or not  what people do during a downturn won t change what businesses  i e   advertisers  do  They ll spend less on advertising  which means less revenue for Facebook 
If you have any lingering doubt that  new internet  companies can t overcome such old businesses realities  look no further than Alphabet Inc C  NASDAQ GOOG 
Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  This
The company has long reigned supreme in the online advertising world  And like Facebook  its product  online search  is not its business  advertising  
And guess what happened when the company endured its first recession 
Countless pundits were convinced that the company would be sheltered from the downturn 
In fact  one  at the time read   Why Online Ads Are Weathering the Recession  In most media  2009 will bring unkind cuts and Madison Avenue will never be the same  But internet advertising seems to be holding up  
They were dead wrong 
Online advertising spending started to dip in the second quarter of 2008  before suffering a dramatic drop in early 2009 
And sure enough  Google saw its share price suffer  When it was all said and done  shares had sunk by more than 60  from the beginning of the recession in December 2007 

As Alphabet Goes  So Goes Facebook
Don t be fooled into believing that Facebook will be spared a similar fate  Instead  be on the lookout for the first signs of another recession 
It ll be your cue to start selling Facebook short  And it s coming sooner rather than later 
Since World War II  the United States has entered a recession roughly every four years 
The two longest intervals between recessions were eight years and 10 months  between February 1961 and December 1969  and 10 years  March 1991 to March 2001  
Currently  it s been almost seven years since the last recession ended in June 2009 
Now  just because we re  overdue  doesn t mean a recession will magically materialize  It won t  Not without warning 
That is  as long as you know where to look 
In March 2013  I shared two of the most reliable recession indicators   Piger s  Recession Probability Index  and the 2 10 Spread 
Neither is flashing any warnings right now  although the 2 10 spread started moving in an ominous direction in February 
Nevertheless  I recommend you keep a close eye on them both in the months ahead  They hold the key to timing another profitable short trade in Facebook  And it s coming sooner rather than later

116902,338417,SPGI,Can S P Global  SPGI  Pull A Surprise This Earnings Season ,opinion,"McGraw Hill Financial which is rechristened as S P Global  Inc    NYSE SPGI   is slated to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 28  In the previously concluded quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 4  
Notably  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 6 9   Nonetheless  it remains to be seen if the company will be able to keep its earnings streak alive  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Likely Earnings Beat in the Cards
Our proven model shows that S P Global is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  The Most Accurate estimate stands at  1 38  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 34  So the ensuing difference   the Earnings ESP   is of  2 99   A positive ESP combined with the company s Zacks Rank  3  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
S P Global is now focusing on its core business which is helping it emerge as a leader among rating providers  benchmark providers  and analytics in the global capital and commodity markets  The company has been consistently making strategic investments in businesses such as the buyout of SNL Financial to facilitate long term profitability 
The formation of S P Dow Jones Indices  coupled with S P Capital IQ s acquisitions of Credit Market Analysis Limited  QuantHouse  R2 Financial Technologies along with a significant stake in India s leading rating agency CRISIL  position it well against its competitors to grab a wider market through superior functionality and investor oriented services and in turn boost top and bottom line results 
All these endeavors have helped it to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak for the thirteenth quarter in a row  when it reported first quarter 2016 results  We believe the company is anticipated to report better than expected earnings when it will report second quarter earnings based on the aforementioned factors S P GLOBAL INC Price and EPS Surprise

116904,338419,SPGI,3 Long And Short Plays On The TPP,opinion,"Recently  President Obama made his last state visit to Asia 
The trip had two official purposes for the president  First  to attend the G20 summit in China  Then Obama went down to Laos to pitch the  
The massive trade agreement would involve 12 countries and hundreds of American businesses  It seeks to boost American exports  ensure fair commercial practices and protect American labor 
But the deal has an uncertain future  Despite bipartisan support from Congress and the White House  both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump oppose the TPP 
The fate of the trade agreement is anyone s guess  However  some TPP supporting companies could see significant changes in their stock prices if the agreement passes  or fails   This creates an opportunity for investors who are optimistic about the fate of the TPP 
It also creates a short play opportunity for those who are pessimistic about the future of the deal 
Let s look at three companies whose bottom lines could be affected 

S P Global
One vocal TPP supporting industry is financial services  As such  the folks who maintain your favorite stock market indexes are big fans of the deal 
S P Global Inc  NYSE SPGI  compiles the S P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Before this year  it was known as McGraw Hill Financial  The company has spent more than  1 million lobbying individually for the TPP  It s also a member of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  another big part of the pro TPP business coalition 
If the deal passes  it will be good news for S P Global shareholders  The stock has already risen by almost 27  this year 

The gains will likely continue if S P Global gets its way on the TPP  On the other hand  if the deal is shot down by the next president  the stock may lose some of its upward momentum  A TPP related pullback would create a potential shorting opportunity 
Hanesbrands
A former division of Sara Lee Corporation  Hanesbrands Inc  NYSE HBI  was spun off into its own publicly traded company in 2006  Since then  it has enjoyed considerable success in the apparel industry  thanks in part to its supply chain strategy 
As of late  the retailer has been building lots of factories in Vietnam  another TPP signatory country  It has invested more than  50 million in Vietnamese manufacturing  and it has spent millions lobbying for the trade agreement  As such  Hanesbrands is another major TPP stakeholder 
The passage of the deal could provide some much needed momentum to Hanesbrands stock  Its shares have had a bumpy year 

On the other hand  if the TPP fails  it could potentially cause a sell off in this volatile investment  Long and short plays on Hanesbrands both have the potential to make big returns  It depends on the deal s future 

Viacom
Viacom Inc  NASDAQ VIA  is one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world  Throughout the 2000s and 2010s  it has become one of the loudest advocates for online intellectual property rights 
IP is one of the biggest concerns of the TPP  it has a whole chapter on the subject   Viacom is one of the world s biggest IP watchdogs  and it has also independently funded pro TPP campaigns  When you put these things together  it becomes clear that Viacom has a lot riding on the deal 
Viacom is another stock that could use a boost from a TPP ratification  Its stock price has gone through some sharp rises and falls in the last year  If the deal is vetoed  the current sell off may continue  That could be quite profitable for investors who short the stock 

Whatever your opinion of the TPP  we can all agree on one thing   
Its passage or failure will have huge economic effects in the United States and beyond 
There s a chance that Obama and the current Congress will be able to ratify it this year  But it s just as likely that the agreement will stall until it s on the next president s desk

116941,338456,SPGI,McGraw Hill Financial  Wait To Buy Until Another Bear Market,opinion,"You may be more familiar with McGraw Hill Financial  N MHFI  by its very widely used  at least in investment circles  S P brand 
Not only is McGraw Hill Financial a Dividend Aristocrat   but the company actually created the Dividend Aristocrats Index 
McGraw Hill was created in 1917 with the merging of the McGraw Publishing Company and the Hill Publishing Company  In 1957  the company introduced the S P 500  Today  McGraw Hill Financial has a market cap of over  25 billion 
In 2011  McGraw Hill announced that it would split its financial and education businesses  The split was completed in 2013 when Apollo Global management purchased the education side of the business for  2 5 billion 
Business Overview 
McGraw Hill Financial is organized into 4 business segments 
S P Ratings
S P Capital IQ
S P DJ Indices
Commodities   Commercial
The image below gives a graphical overview of the size of each business segment
 Source  McGraw Hill Financial Barclays  L BARC  Presentation  slide 5
The S P Ratings line of business rates corporate and government debt  rates bank loans  and provides corporate credit estimates  The business also provides credit surveillance  customer relationship pricing programs  and entity credit ratings 
The company s second largest business line is its S P Capital IQ Business  This business provides data feeds and enterprise solutions  credit ratings related informational products  investment research products  and advisory services for pricing and analytic analysis 
The S P DJ Indices division generates revenue through licensing its name to investment products  through data subscriptions and custom indexes  and through creating OTC and custom derivative products 
Finally  the Commodities and Commercial division provides news  data  price assessments  consulting  and custom research for the construction and automotive industry  The Commodities   Commercial business line operates primarily under the Platts  J D  Power  and McGraw Hill Construction names 
Competitive Advantage Analysis
McGraw Hill Financial has paid increasing dividends for 42 consecutive years  The company is the leading index fund provider and the leading rating agency  It is very apparent that McGraw Hill Financial has a strong competitive advantage 
McGraw Hill Financial is one of the big 3 rating agencies  along with Moody s  MCO  and Fitch Ratings  Together  the big 3 control about 95  of the financial debt rating industry globally  Oligopolistic markets are characterized by high margins  
McGraw Hill Financial s S P Rating division has generated over half of McGraw Hill Financial s profits over the first 6 months of fiscal 2015  The rating division has maintained operating margins north of 40  since 2011 
S P Ratings possesses one of the most profitable business models anywhere  The company is very unlikely to lose its position as one of the top rating agencies globally  It would take an enormous amount of goodwill to be able to even compete with S P Ratings  Not only is the company s competitive advantage in ratings highly profitable  it is extremely durable  It would be exceptionally difficult and costly to unseat S P Ratings due to the company s history  relationships  respect  and goodwill 
McGraw Hill Financial has an even higher margin business unit than S P Ratings  The S P Dow Jones business unit has maintained operating margins over 50  since 2011  The unit capitalizes on the well established Dow Jones and S P brand names to generate licensing revenue from expanding index and ETF products  Again  the S P and Dow brands are very strong and durable 
As a whole  McGraw Hill Financial s competitive advantage is based on trust and the respect that comes from being the industry standard  The company has a strong durable competitive advantage that is very likely to continue far into the future 
Future Growth Prospects
McGraw Hill Financial has 2 primary growth drivers 
Growing popularity of index funds
Low interest rates driving increased debt issuance
McGraw Hill Financial generates licensing revenue from ETFs with the S P and Dow brand names  ETFs continue to gain market share from actively managed mutual funds due to lower expense ratios which typically result in better performance 
From the first 6 months of 2014 through the   the S P Dow Jones segment saw revenue grow 7  and operating income increase 10   Interestingly  the S P 500 was up 6  over the same period  Most of the company s ETF licensing growth was a result of market gains 
During bull markets  ETF cash inflows will remain strong  I expect ETF AUM to continue gaining market share over mutual funds and propelling the S P Dow Jones business unit s growth  The unit will likely grow operating income in the high single digits or low double digits as long as the trend toward ETFs continues 
The growth driver for the company s flagship S P Ratings division is issuance of government and corporate debt globally  Debt issuance has been up significantly since the recession of 2009 due to extremely low interest rates throughout the world brought about artificially by central bank policies 
Risks   Expected Total Returns
McGraw Hill Financial will likely see steep earnings declines during the next large recession  The company s S P Dow Jones segment in particular will suffer as investors reduce their exposure to equities resulting in lower assets under management for ETFs 
Recessions and economic slowdowns will also hut the company s flagship ratings segment  Debt issuances tend to slow during bear markets as growth projects are put on hold  meaning less financing is needed  and banks and other financial institutions are less willing to lend 
In addition  McGraw Hill Financial is also exposed to interest rate risk  Low interest rates will not and cannot last forever  When interest rates increase  debt issuance will slow and the company s ratings profits will decline 
Over the last several years  McGraw Hill Financial has managed to realize compound 20   earnings per share growth  This exceptional growth is from a confluence of low interest rates and a strong bull market 
Over full economic cycles  the company will likely grow earnings per share at around 10  a year  This growth combined with the company s current dividend yield of 1 4  gives investors an expected annual total return of around 11 4  
Valuation and Final Thoughts
McGraw Hill Financial currently trades at a price to earnings ratio of 21 8  using adjusted earnings   The company is likely trading around the high end of fair value given its slightly above average expected total returns 
There are two simple facts that make me hesitant about adding to or initiating a position in McGraw Hill Financial 
It is very likely the company will see its earning and price to earnings ratio fall significantly during a bear market
There will always be another bear market
Simply put  now is not an especially opportune time to purchase McGraw Hill Financial  When another bear market comes around  McGraw Hill Financial will likely be a much more attractive purchase 
McGraw Hill Financial is a high quality business build around an extremely durable competitive advantage  Oddly for a Dividend Aristocrat  McGraw Hill Financial is a better candidate for growth investors who have a favorable macroeconomic outlook than for dividend growth investors seeking current income and strong dividend growth 
Due to the company s above average price to earnings ratio and below average dividend yield  McGraw Hill financial does not currently rank well using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing ",2015-10-19,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-9-of-52:-mcgraw-hill-financial-268467,268467
116942,338457,SPGI,MHFI  A High Quality Dividend Aristocrat With Strong Brands,opinion,"McGraw Hill Financial  NYSE MHFI  owns one of the most important brands in the financial services market and has grown into a powerhouse provider of mission critical information 
The company s many strengths have enabled helped it grow its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years  making it a member of the dividend aristocrats list and a high quality dividend stock we would consider for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewMcGraw Hill Financial was incorporated in 1925 and has grown to be a major financial data and analytics company that serves many different customers in capital markets and commodity markets such as investment banks  asset managers  insurance companies  stock exchanges  energy traders  automotive executives  and more  Some of McGraw Hill s famous brands include Standard   Poors  S P   S P Capital IQ  Platts  and J D  Power 
By customer type  McGraw Hill generated 48  of its revenue from corporates  19  from investment managers  17  from commercial banks   insurers  and 16  from investment banks 
The company s business consists of four segments today which generate 40  of their sales outside of the U S 
S P Ratings  46  of sales  52  of segment profit   provides credit ratings  research  and analytics to investors and bond issuers  S P Ratings has been providing important information for over 150 years to help investors make better decisions and improve companies  access to capital markets 
S P Capital IQ and SNL  25  of sales  14  of segment profit   provides a wide range of research  data  analytics  and tools in the form of desktop and enterprise solutions  Customers such as asset managers  investment banks  and others in the financial markets use them make better investment decisions  track their performance  analyze risk  and more 
S P Dow Jones Indices  11  of sales  18  of segment profit   provides global indices that serve as benchmarks for investors  This segment makes money from exchange traded funds  ETFs   derivatives  and index related licensing fees  It is well positioned to grow from the trend toward passive investing 
Commodities   Commercial  18  of sales  16  of segment profit   provides analytics  pricing data  and other information to help businesses improve their performance and help markets increase their transparency  Its main brands include Platts and J D  Power Business AnalysisMcGraw Hill primarily benefits from its strong brand recognition  Participants in financial markets and executives in commercial markets need extremely reliable  accurate  and trustworthy information to make critical business and investment decisions 
The company s primary brand  Standard   Poor s  has been around since 1860  establishing long lasting customer relationships built on trust and quality  McGraw Hill purchased S P in 1966 and hasn t looked back 
In addition to hard to replicate brands built on reputation and trust  McGraw Hill s business benefits from the U S  Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 that requires financial market participants to use nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  NRSROs   These are the only ratings agencies that the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission permits other financial companies to depend on for regulatory purposes 
There were only 10 NRSROs as of December 2015  which limits competition and helps McGraw Hill maintain strong market share and profitability  Registration with the government is very difficult  and new players have no reputation built up  which keeps barriers to entry high for the company s S P Ratings segment 
McGraw Hill s business model is also very attractive  The company primarily makes money based on subscriptions  which accounted for 61  of total revenue last fiscal year and provide a substantial base of recurring revenue 
Customers need McGraw Hill s data and services to continue their operations  which makes this part of the business very sticky  As an example  the SNL business McGraw Hill recently acquired has a 94  renewal rate  Recurring subscriptions help smooth out results and continue delivering free cash flow when the company s transaction based revenue  e g  bond issuance  takes a dip 
Management has also taken steps over the last several years to refocus the business on its strengths in the financial services market and is even looking to change the company s name to S P Global to better reflect this shift  The company sold its education publishing business in 2013 for  2 4 billion and is currently looking to sell its J D  Power business as well 
In addition to divestitures  McGraw Hill has actively acquired companies that fit its strategy  Most recently  the company acquired SNL Financial for  2 2 billion in 2015  SNL is a major news and data services provider that serves the financial  real estate  energy  media  and metals   mining sectors 
This deal will help McGraw Hill offer a more compelling bundle of services to its existing customers  SNL s services largely complement McGraw Hill s S P Capital IQ business and widen the reach of its Platts business in commodities markets  McGraw Hill also has plenty of opportunity to expand SNL s services overseas  over 90  of its revenue was from the Americas at the time of the acquisition  
McGraw Hill s growth should benefit as it continues assembling a portfolio of assets that can be cross sold to existing customers  increase switching costs  generate higher deal values  and scale easily McGraw Hill s Key RisksMcGraw Hill is sensitive to financial markets  which drive the performance of many of its clients and impact the amount of business it conducts  One of the bigger risks that could occur over the next several years would be a slowdown in the number of bonds issued  which would dent demand for the company s ratings services 
Low interest rates around the world have resulted in a surge in borrowing by practically every type of company  and this environment is unlikely to prove sustainable  If less debt is issued in future years  there will be fewer securities for S P to rate to make money on  We are already starting to see this effect as McGraw Hill noted that bond issuance fell by 22  during its fourth quarter and caused its S P Ratings segment to decline by 7  
Additionally  the company would be hurt in the event of a bear market or another financial crisis  McGraw Hill s reputation took a hit along with the other ratings agencies during the last recession as many high rated pieces of subprime debt issued during the housing boom went bust  This dented trust in the company and could happen again 
Volatile financial markets are also less favorable environments for companies to issue debt in  and financial clients such as investment banks and asset managers have less money to spend when M A deal volumes fall  trading volumes drop  and assets under management decline in value  These are all bad things for McGraw Hill s business in the near term  although they arguably have little impact on the company s long term earnings power 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that longer term  the greater availability and affordability of data is likely to remain a theme  Information is becoming cheaper and easier to access every day  Depending on how this plays out  it could begin to erode some of McGraw Hill s competitive advantages  although for now it seems extremely unlikely that its customers would have a trusted  deep enough alternative to consider Dividend Analysis  McGraw HillWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
McGraw Hill s dividend is extremely safe as indicated by the company s Dividend Safety Score of 83  The company s earnings payout ratio over the last 12 months is 32   which is relatively low and provides management with plenty of flexibility to keep paying and growing the dividend  Over the last decade  McGraw Hill s earnings payout ratio has also remained near 30   which means the company s dividend growth has been sustainably fueled by earnings growth 
While McGraw Hill s low payout ratio is a plus  its sales are sensitive to broader health of financial markets  When capital markets decline in value  fewer bonds are issued and many clients are less willing to spend money on new data  tools  and analytics  As a result  we can see that MHFI s business did not fare too well during the financial crisis Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Importantly  McGraw Hill has generated free cash flow in each of the last 10 years  Free cash flow is needed to pay dividends  repay debt  repurchase shares  and fund acquisitions  Companies with strong business models generate consistent free cash flow  and McGraw Hill is no exception  The company s businesses are very scalable and require little incremental capital to grow  generating plenty of cash Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company s strong brands  capital light operations  and valuable information have allowed it to achieve exceptional returns on invested capital over the past year  Even during the financial crisis McGraw Hill achieved a return of at least 17   Businesses with high returns and plenty of opportunities for growth can grow their earnings and dividends faster Source  Simply Safe Dividends
McGraw Hill s balance sheet is in good shape and further bolster s its Dividend Safety Score  The company has about  1 5 billion in cash compared to  3 6 billion in debt and could cover its debt with cash and 1 1 years  of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Its interest coverage ratio is also a very healthy 18 8 Source  Simply Safe Dividends
McGraw Hill s dividend is very safe  The company s low payout ratio  strong cash flow generation  recurring revenue  and healthy balance sheet make it a rock solid dividend payer Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
McGraw Hill s Dividend Growth score of 53 is about average  The company is a member of the dividend aristocrats list and has increased its dividend by 7 2  per year over the last decade  Most recently  management raised the company s quarterly dividend by 9  in January 2016 
With an earnings payout ratio near 30   healthy recurring revenue  and potential for decent growth going forward  we believe McGraw Hill can continue increasing its dividend at a mid single digit rate barring a collapse in bond issuance or broader capital markets ValuationMHFI s stock trades at 18 4x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 1 5   which is roughly in line with its five year average dividend yield of 1 6  
The company s diluted earnings per share have compounded by 9 7  per year over the last five years  and we expect a high single digit rate of growth to continue  Under this assumption  McGraw Hill s total return potential appears to be close to 10  per year  We believe the stock is fairly priced today ConclusionMcGraw Hill is a blue chip dividend stocks that has many hard to replicate businesses and brands  We like the company s strong base of recurring revenue  but it s hard to get comfortable with the risk of slowing bond issuance trends  We would ultimately prefer to buy this stock if it was weakened considerably more by growing macro concerns  which are enough to keep us on the sidelines for now ",2016-03-04,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mhfi:-a-high-quality-dividend-aristocrat-with-strong-brands-200120472,200120472
116959,338474,SPGI,Invest To Win  Book Review,opinion,Invest to Win  Earn and Keep Profits in Bull and Bear Markets with the GainsMaster Approach by Toni Turner and Gordon Scott  McGraw Hill  2013  is a deceptively elementary book  Although its largest audience will undoubtedly be newly self directed investors  even the experienced investor will learn a thing or two   The GainsMaster approach has four key elements   1  define your objectives   2  evaluate market conditions   3  choose your opportunities  and  4  manage your risk  Since the inputs to these elements vary from person to person and hence require a level of self knowledge and self assessment   Investing strategies need to be built from the inside out    each chapter in the book concludes with a section that addresses the emotional side of investing   The authors cover such basics as finding a broker  fundamental analysis  technical analysis  and ETFs  But perhaps their most useful contribution is their analysis of market conditions    whether investors are seeking safety or opportunity  To ascertain whether the market is in a STOP or a GO mode  they use a combination of three indicators  the twelve month moving average  volatility as measured by the average true range  and safety seeking behavior  for instance  how do utility stocks perform compared to the market as a whole     Once an investor has evaluated market conditions  one strategy is to turn to lists of ETFs to  select opportunities and also keep an eye on the markets    p  216  The most general list for a GO sign market includes SPY  DBC  EFA  EEM  and LQD  The investor should determine which are the two strongest ETFs on this list and then drill down  looking for the four strongest ETFs on the two lists  If  for instance  commodities and emerging markets are the strongest  the investor should look for the strongest ETFs among DBC  DBA  DBB  GDX and EEM  EWZ  PIN  RSX  FXI  EWM  EPP and ILF  Other Strategies Relative strength is only one of several strategies the authors describe  They also offer two even simpler strategies  for instance  that they call  Keeping It in the Fridge  and  Making Some Dough    Invest to Win is a well balanced book that seeks to improve upon buy and hold investing with some market timing and better stock ETF selection  Investors could do a lot worse than to follow the advice of these two well known financial educators ,2013-03-25,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/invest-to-win:-book-review-160343,160343

116966,338481,SPGI,Book Review  Trade Like A Stock Market Wizard,opinion,Mark Minervini  U S  investing champion in 1997  averaged a 220  return per year from 1994 to 2000 for a compounded total return of 33 500   Yes  we all know that these astonishing figures coincided with a major bull market  but how many traders came anywhere close to his record during this period   In Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard  How to Achieve Superperformance in Stocks in Any Market  McGraw Hill  2013  Minervini shares his SEPA  Specific Entry Point Analysis  trading strategy  It s essentially a trend following breakout strategy that screens for such variables as earnings surprises and relative strength and that looks for catalysts driving institutional interest  It relies on both fundamentals and technicals  Its focus is on youthful small  to mid cap stocks   There are strong echoes of Bill O Neil  Ben and Mitch Zacks  Richard Donchian  even Jesse Livermore in Minervini s work  That he borrows from such luminaries is not surprising  Having dropped out of school at the age of 15  he subsequently became  a fanatical student of the stock market    Over the years   he writes   I ve read an incredible number of investment books  including more than 1 000 titles in my personal library alone    p  3   Minervini s approach is not for the lazy unless  of course  you want to subscribe to his real time service  Although some of the screens can be done with the push of a button  the investor will have to follow up with his own fundamental research and chart analysis  For instance  what is the quality of a company s earnings  How powerful is the competition  As an example  Minervini writes that  It s no coincidence that within only 15 trading days of Netflix going public  Blockbuster Video s stock permanently topped out    From the point at which Netflix went public  to its high in 2011   the stock increased more than 3 400 percent  During the same period Blockbuster s stock price lost 99 percent of its value    pp  102 104   For those who have the guts to buy 52 week highs  for those who are looking for the next mega performer  and for those who are willing to put in the time to become a skilled analyst and trader  Minervini s book will resonate  Even those who are disinclined to chase performance  which often simply means buying after a trend has been established  will discover that the book has a lot of merit   Instead of delving deeper into SEPA  however worthy a task  let me share three thoughts from his section on risk management    To achieve consistent profitability  you must protect your profits and principal  As a matter of fact  I don t differentiate between the two  A big mistake I see many traders make is to consider trading profits as house money   Let s say I make  5 000 on Monday  I don t consider myself  5 000  ahead of the game   free to risk that amount shooting for the moon  My account simply has a new starting balance  subject to the same set of rules as before    p  273   And  a subhead   If you re not feeling stupid  you re not managing risk   He continues   Making you feel stupid is the market s way of pressuring you to act foolish  Don t succumb  Remain disciplined and cut your losses  The alternative to managing risk is not managing risk  and that never turns out well    p  289   Finally  perhaps with a nod to Warren Buffett   You will never achieve superperformance if you overly diversify and rely on diversification for protection    If you are strict with your selection criteria and demand the best for your portfolio  it should be difficult to find a lot of names that are worthy to be included among your elite group    pp  312 13 ,2013-05-08,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-trade-like-a-stock-market-wizard-166101,166101
116971,338486,SPGI,Book Review  Winning The Loser s Game,opinion,Those who are convinced they can consistently beat the market will find Charles D  Ellis s book depressing reading  The underlying thesis of Winning the Loser s Game  Timeless Strategies for Successful Investing  6th ed   McGraw Hill  2013  is that in recent decades investment management has evolved from a winner s game to a loser s game because  the market came to be dominated by the very institutions that were striving to win by outperforming the market  No longer is the active investment manager competing with overly cautious custodians or overly confident amateurs who are out of touch with the fast moving market  Now he or she competes with other hardworking investment experts in a loser s game where the secret to  winning  is to lose less than the others lose    pp  5 6 Put another way  and here I invoke Michael Mauboussin s The Success Equation  we are faced with the paradox of skill   As skill improves  performance becomes more consistent  and therefore luck becomes more important   That is  as the population of skilled investors rises  with individual retail investors moving to the sidelines  the variation in skill narrows and luck plays a greater role in outperformance  And  as we all know  luck is not predictable  That an investor manager has outperformed the market in the past two or three or even fifteen years in no way guarantees that his luck will continue  Bill Miller of Legg Mason is  of course  the poster child for this truism However you slice it  Ellis argues that the individual investor must reconcile himself to the fact that he will not get outsized returns year after year  whether he hands his money over to a fund manager or  normally even worse  pursues the do it yourself route  Instead  he must plod along  trying to minimize mistakes  Ellis puts it in less tortoise like language   As all grandparents and most parents know and as most grandchildren will come to know the real test of a good driver is simple  no serious accidents  And as all flyers know  safe  dull even boring is the essence of a good flight  The secret to success in investing is not in beating the market any more than success in driving is going 10 MPH over the posted speed limit  Success in driving is being on the right road and moving at a reasonable speed    p  51 What are some of the mistakes investors make  They pay too much in fees  they trade too often  they ignore tax considerations  they fail to diversify  and they have no clearly defined objectives And if you still think that active management is the way to go  Ellis offers a couple of sobering statistics   Over 10 year periods  two out of three active managers  results fall below the market averages and below index funds  Over longer periods  more fall below   And  Those managers who fall short fall short by nearly twice as much as those who do better do better    p  153  He adds   Yes  Virginia  some managers will always beat the market  but we have no reliable way of determining in advance which specific managers will be the lucky ones    p  166 There are more than 500 000 copies of Winning the Loser s Game in print  Whether readers acted on Ellis s advice or promptly ignored what they were told I have no way of knowing  Creators of mutual funds and ETFs certainly listened  There is now a virtual supermarket of index and quasi index funds and ETFs available  Some have higher fees than others  some trade more frequently than others  some  beware   are pegged to bizarre indexes  All in all  the investor still has his work cut out for him  Ellis is standing by to lend him a helping hand ,2013-06-26,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-winning-the-loser’s-game-172921,172921
116978,338493,SPGI,Book Review  The End Of The Risk Free Rate,opinion,Ben Emons  a senior vice president and global portfolio manager at PIMCO  argues that we need to adjust our financial models to reflect  as the book s title states  The End of the Risk Free Rate  Investing When Structural Forces Change Government Debt  McGraw Hill  2013   Emons  thesis  if sound  is challenging  it calls for a paradigm shift  For instance  equities are priced off the risk free rate  But if there is no longer a risk free rate  if  to look only at the domestic market  U S  Treasuries now carry an element of risk  and presumably an element of risk that is dynamic  how do you calculate the risk premium that is built into a stock price  Equity pricing models need to be redrawn  And options prices would have to be recalibrated as well  the risk free rate is  after all  an input to the Black Scholes model   A proofreading aside  it is not as it appears in both the text and the index the Black Sholes model    Unfortunately  Emons  book doesn t serve his thesis especially well  He writes like a bond guy  actually like a Dutch bond guy  Which means that his prose is often incomprehensible  To take but a single sentence and it s supposed to be a full sentence  p  62    In connection is a  sudden stop  at which foreign capital withdrawals that cannot be offset sufficiently by domestic capital   I assume that  withdrawals  should read  withdraws   but I can t parse  in connection   The book suffers mightily from the absence of a good copy editor and proofreader   For those who are willing to soldier on  let me try to summarize the author s argument for his claim that  the present day risk free rate resembles an  upside down  world   First  the  risk free rate can be seen as the sum of two kinds of expectations  an expectation of future inflation and future real GDP growth   With the so called risk free rate now at 0  we can conclude that both expectations have been dampened considerably   That effect gets momentum in case of  flight to safety  during a crisis situation  Because this flight to safety affects the risk free rate  it also affects risk premiums for other securities   In 2012 the equity risk premium reached its highest level since the 1960s  nearly five percent   Based on historical data on equity risk premiums by Ibbotson  at ultra low levels of risk free rates  the risk premiums represent an  old normal   It creates the perception that  for example  stocks are dramatically undervalued  That may not be fully correct because historical models are using a risk free rate based on the assumption of growth rates from better times   And so  Emons concludes  we get to the upside down world where the risk free rate  is distorted on the one hand by flight to safety and central banks  on the other hand  the risk free rate is assumed in models to be at old school value when growth was higher    pp  29 30   This book is ostensibly directed at investors who have to make decisions in this new  uncertain environment  I would narrow its audience to exclude all but relatively sophisticated bond investors  academics  and professional money managers  Retail investors in stocks who are not comfortable with the language of bonds will struggle ,2013-07-03,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-the-end-of-the-risk-free-rate-173862,173862
116979,338494,SPGI,Book Review  All About Day Trading,opinion,Jake Bernstein  who already has more than 44 books to his credit  is back with yet another  All About Day Trading  McGraw Hill  2013   It s written for the novice who wants to try his hand at trading stocks and or futures intraday   Some of the advice  such as not to trade with a delayed quote feed  is directed at those whom I would unkindly call dim bulbs  But most of Bernstein s dos and don ts  mostly don ts  are not only good tips for beginners but useful reminders for those traders  and not just day traders  who have amassed more experience than profits   Bernstein advocates what he calls the STF  setup  trigger  and follow through  trading model  The setup is a testable algorithm no subjective   look like  patterns allowed here  The trigger can be defined in terms of a technical indicator  preferably one that s not bounded since indicators that have upper and lower limits  such as RSI and Lane s stochastic indicator  give too many false signals  Follow through includes both managing risk and maximizing profit  Exits  in the author s view  are less mechanical than entries   Bernstein offers some specific examples as they relate to the STF trading structure  For instance  trading with gaps  an open close moving average method  a moving average channel method  and a 30 minute breakout method   A key chapter deals with trade management  Bernstein argues that  every trade you make must have a predetermined stop loss  as well as a predetermined first profit target    p  109  How does the trader set his stop loss and profit target   The stop loss for each trade must be a function of the underlying system  and or market volatility   not just a function of what you can afford to risk    p  110  Six tables illustrate his point  Each shows the same trading strategy with different stop loss amounts   500   1000   1500   2500   4000  and no stop loss   Note   he says   the significant improvement in performance as the size of the stop loss increases  Note also that the stop loss size eventually reaches a point of diminishing returns  at which an increase in the stop loss no longer improves performance commensurately    p  111   As for profit maximization  big money is made in the big move   80 to 90 percent of your money is going to be made on 10 to 20 percent of your trades    p  118  Trading more than one lot  preferably multiples of three   allows you the flexibility of taking in some profits   and holding some profits for the anticipated large move    p  111   Bernstein also touches on the  higher  frequency trading that is available to the retail trader  He describes some futures trades he himself made using one minute charts to generate trading opportunities during established trends   All About Day Trading is  as the title indicates  quite comprehensive  It s a very good place for the novice trader to start ,2013-07-15,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-all-about-day-trading-175414,175414
116980,338495,SPGI,Book Review  Option Volatility And Pricing  2d Ed  ,opinion,Many moons ago  when I was a residential college dean at Yale  one of my tasks was to write recommendations for law school applicants  It seemed that everybody applied to Harvard Law  no matter how mediocre their academic record  So I devised a system that would preserve my credibility and  at the same time  do the best for my students  I wrote two recommendations for each of my so so students one for schools that might actually admit them and another for schools that would never consider them  It wasn t that the first letter was good and the second bad  rather the first letter was good and the second merely descriptive  For the most promising students I often wrote a very short letter  essentially saying that unless the admissions committee was a bunch of dimwits they simply had to accept X or Y  The system worked exceedingly well  The right students got into the right schools and everybody seemed to be satisfied Why this stroll down memory lane  Because once again I feel that brevity is in order  My message here is simple  everyone who trades options as stand alone instruments or who uses options to hedge stock or futures positions should own a copy of Sheldon Natenberg s Option Volatility and Pricing  Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques  McGraw Hill  2015   Even those who have a copy of the first edition published twenty years ago should pony up for the second edition because it has been considerably updated  revised  and expanded Yes  the subtitle says that it is an advanced book and it definitely is  For instance  it deals with such topics as volatility skews and binomial option pricing  But it is written for the trader  not the academic  and it s math lite  though heavy on the Greeks  including higher order sensitivities such as vanna  color  and zomma   Moreover  it proceeds step by step  starting with the basic building blocks  some presented in a way quite different from the usual fare  For instance  Natenberg constructs parity graphs of complex positions using slopes  The reader who s brand new to options trading will really have to stretch  but it s a book he can grow with The upshot  If you buy only one book on options  which I don t recommend   this should be the one  It s a textbook  a reference book  and a guide for the perplexed  If  by the way  you re still perplexed after reading Option Volatility and Pricing  a companion workbook will be coming out sometime next year ,2014-12-01,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-option-volatility-and-pricing-(2d-ed.)-234238,234238

117008,338523,SPGI,Book Review  Investing Between The Lines,opinion,L  J  Rittenhouse spent ten years as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers  1981 1991  before leaving Wall Street to found her own firm  Rittenhouse Rankings  an investor relations firm that advises businesses on improving valuation through candid assessments of corporate strategies  investor perceptions  and corporate communications  She is the author of two previous books  Do Business with People You Can Tru t and Buffett s Bites  Her latest book is Investing Between the Lines  How to Make Smarter Decisions by Decoding CEO Communications  McGraw Hill  2013    The basic premise of the book is that high levels of executive candor are linked to superior market performance  On the one hand are the annual shareholder letters of Warren Buffett  the gold standard of executive candor  On the other hand are  FOG  communications  ones that abound in  fact deficient  obfuscating generalities    p  97  They use weasel words  clich s  jargon  and hyperbole  Their explanations may be incomplete  their grammar awkward  They often foreshadow subnormal  even disastrous returns   Rittenhouse offers page after page of detailed analyses of corporate communications  These analyses are not always intuitively obvious  But the author is adamant   When people tell me they don t believe that they are smart enough to uncover the truth about executive FOG  I conclude that they either are lazy or lack the confidence to use their common sense    p  271  Well  I guess that put me in my place   I think back to Brand Blanshard s 1953 lecture On Philosophical Style  the classic presentation of the thesis that profundity and clarity are not opposed philosophical virtues but rather required companions  Blanshard bemoaned the fact  in private 1980 correspondence  that  most writing nowadays is exceedingly shuffling  muddled  and ponderous   By contrast  he noted in his lecture  John Locke and John Stuart Mill  each had the enviable faculty of making people say   If he is not right  at least he deserves to be  he puts all his cards on the table  he keeps nothing back  he fights  thinks  and writes fairly  even to the point of writing clearly enough to be found out    For Blanshard  as for Rittenhouse  candor is a virtue   The unfortunate reality is that good writing  whether in philosophy or in business  is a rarity  As Blanshard concludes his lecture   We may have to agree with Professor Raleigh that  to write perfect prose is neither more nor less difficult than to lead a perfect life      I ve gone off on a tangent and I m not quite sure how to bring this post home  Is it the case that for a CEO to write good  or at least candid  prose is neither more nor less difficult than for him to lead a good  or a profitable  company  I doubt it highly  in fact  the very suggestion sounds downright silly   But a CEO has limited opportunities to communicate with shareholders  and shareholders have limited opportunities to find out how management views the company s performance and its prospects  Rittenhouse works both sides of the street  She tries to help companies communicate better at the same time that she informs investors on how to decode these communications  It might be viewed as a conflict of interests  but I for one am grateful for her efforts ,2013-01-30,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-investing-between-the-lines-153112,153112

117038,338553,SPGI,Wood Mackenzie Acquisition  Who And At What Price ,opinion,Bloomberg reported rumors that McGraw Hill  MHP  had out bid it and others at 1 1 billion pounds   1 7 billion  for energy consultant and advisory service provider Wood Mackenzie  Wood Mac is being flipped by Charterhouse Capital Partners which acquired it in 2009 for 520 million pounds in a fire sale  Other suitors in the auction according to  include IHS  Thomson Reuters  TRI  and Bloomberg itself but perhaps not all love it THAT much to outbid McGraw Hill    All of this is speculation at this stage and the story itself could be part of the dance to tease out a better bid or give the apparent high bidder  buyers remorse  depending upon the market reaction to the bid price  But whichever firm wins the auction there are a lot of questions about what this means for WoodMac and its competitors    McGraw Hill  MHP is no stranger to the energy information space as the corporate parent for Platts and previous owner of DRI McGraw Hill which was sold off and then merged with its arch rival Warton Econometrics  WEFA  to form Global Insight which was itself acquired by IHS in 2008  The Bloomberg story says WoodMac is a good fit with Platts  The challenge will be who eats whom   Platts is primarily a data company and WoodMac has plenty of oil and gas data to add to the collection  But McGraw Hill is primarily a publisher and seller of financial data products and has historically not been seen as a consultant nor has it favored one time revenue services so an acquisition risks flight of WoodMac talent and doubt about McGraw Hill s strategy    This acquisition could also be seen as too safe by McGraw Hill investors if they perceive the capital invested in WoodMac could have produced much higher returns from other deals that better leverage new technology or extend the scope of McGraw Hill s business lines into new markets  The biggest risk for MHP is overpaying for WoodMac    On the other hand  WoodMac may significantly strengthen MHP s position in Europe and Asia and in the oil and gas space  but WoodMac has been under invested in North America and electric power  This could end up being d j  vu all over again for McGraw Hill since it previously built up Platts then let it atrophy in the face of competition from Global Energy Decisions now part of IHS    An MHP acquisition of WoodMac would be seen as good news by WoodMac competitors  They will see one to two years of integration distraction and a high likelihood that WoodMac  will be fully digested by the Platts meat grinder  Some of the fears among insiders could be mitigated if WoodMac management is able to retain their sizable position yet again in this flip or take broader roles running Platts   but that may not be attractive for McGraw Hill or it might be a deal killer at the speculated price  Odds of the deal closing   50 50  Odds of integration failure   70 30    IHS  An acquisition of WoodMac by IHS would be a civil war since the Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA  natural gas team defected to WoodMac in a weak period for the firm before CERA was acquired by IHS  The rivalry between CERA and WoodMac significantly raises the integration risk  There is a lot of overlap in the oil and gas space which will require sorting out  CERA s power team is policy focused rather than transactional  CERA traditionally has shunned quantitative analysis of energy market fundamentals thus is seen as weak  WoodMac lacks bench strength to dominate the North American power market advisory services sector but it is stronger in power than CERA with extremely solid power market quantitative analytics skills  Odds of a deal   25 75    Odds of integration failure  85 15    Dark Horse or Disruptive Change Plays   WoodMac represents one of the few good opportunities for a new entrant in the energy vertical to stake a claim to market leadership in one deal  Strong in oil and gas  strong in Europe  known in the US with the potential to fill the vacuum being left by the exit or scaling back of market leaders Ventyx  Navigant and RW Beck  But who and at what price  An investment play from China seeking to gain access to knowledge about North American and EU markets and the technologies at work in the unconventional shales and oil sands and uses that insight to rapidly scale China s own shale potential that would be interesting A global database company strong in EU or Asia and eager to scale growth in North America especially in the energy markets and their adjacency could quickly position WoodMac as a global platform for growth A large technology player seeking leverage from insight into world energy markets for use in developing disruptive innovation solutions to satisfy the growing energy demand with end to end analytics  operations and risk management solutions The question is whether WoodMac s true potential will be enhanced or wasted in this flip    Disclosure   I previously worked at DRI McGraw Hill as a principal as well as at IHS as VP Global Analytics   Data  During the eight years I served as Division President at what became Ventyx  Global Energy Advisors I built high quality teams of global energy experts  Those teams have migrated to WoodMac  CERA  IHS  Black   Veatch  Navigant and other firms  I am not currently engaged by any of these firms  The

117042,338557,SPGI,Book Review   What s Behind The Numbers  ,opinion,I read What s Behind the Numbers  A Guide to Exposing Financial Chicanery and Avoiding Huge Losses in Your Portfolio  McGraw Hill  2013  by John Del Vecchio and Tom Jacobs on a power less Thursday and Friday post Sandy  But I can assure you that  even I had been able to get back to my computer and had worked assiduously all weekend  I still wouldn t have been able  as the authors suggest  to use their book  profitably  on Monday morning  Their long short portfolio is tough to construct  It s not for the instant gratification crowd   About two thirds of the book is directed at investors who would like to improve their portfolio s performance by unearthing accounting tricks that make corporate earnings look better than they are and even more important better than they are going to be  Or  put differently  it is for those who are willing to analyze earnings quality so as either to short stocks with a margin of safety or to avoid ones likely to implode  It  does not advocate   shorting or selling based on overvaluation  fads  frauds  or poor business models  even though these make up the overwhelming majority of stocks sold short  Surprisingly  very bright fundamental investors those who do bottom up research on companies and their industries will only short on these bases  even though they are willing to go long on stock with specific catalysts  It s as if investors with enormous skill at ferreting out value where no one else can find it suddenly have memory loss on the short side    p  19   In analyzing earnings quality the investor should be on the lookout for aggressive revenue recognition  aggressive inventory management  assorted unsustainable boosts to earnings  and cash flow warnings  Each of these red flags gets its own chapter  with telling examples   Let s say you have done a lot of careful research and have built up your short portfolio  The next challenge is to find a long strategy to complement it  The book s recommendation is to seek out sound small cap value stocks   The authors  actual portfolio results are impressive  at least for the years 2007 2009  Whereas the S P 500 lost 17 6  over that time  including dividends   a 100  long 30  short portfolio would have returned 6 4   a 120  long 80  short portfolio would have done the best at 65 9   and a 50  long 50  short portfolio would have gained 43 7    The authors also address the controversial topic of market timing and add a dash of technical analysis to their fundamental mix   The Stock Trader s Almanac named What s Behind the Numbers  the best investment book of the year  although claiming that it s the best investment book of 2013 is a tad premature   The book is very good indeed  It steers the investor in the right direction by emphasizing risk management  and it introduces him to a basic hedge fund strategy with a twist  The writing style is sometimes a little too cute for my taste  but admittedly I can be schoolmarmish  I assume most readers will enjoy its lightheartedness ,2012-11-14,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-'what’s-behind-the-numbers'-143544,143544
117067,338582,SPGI,Markets Push Higher on Greek Debt Progress,opinion,Asian stock and risk currencies are higher as we start trading in Europe on positive news from Greece suggesting that a treasury loss agreement is close to being reached   The main question is the amount of loss private holders of Greek debt will be willing to accept and according to the Prime Minister  Papademos   we should be seeing a final agreement this week   Looking ahead  traders will be watchful of the Consumer Confidence figures scheduled for release in the US  and these are expected to show some additional strength for the month of January   This  if realized  would follow the stronger Business Confidence numbers that were seen in Australia overnight and help support the latest gains in equity markets In the UK  we will see some macro releases that have the potential to move markets  with the M4 Money Supply figures  Net Consumer Credit  and monthly Mortgage Approvals   The data is more likely to cause volatility in the FTSE 100  rather than in currency markets  as this will be followed by some significant earnings reports from British Sky Broadcasting  BSkyB  Ocado Group and ARM Holdings In the US  additional macro data will come in the form of the Case Shiller Home Price Index  the Employment Cost Index and the Chicago Purchasing Managers  Index  PMI    The earnings docket is also heavy today  with Pfizer  Exxon Mobil  Amazon com  United Parcel Service  UPS   Archer Daniels Midland McGraw Hill and BroadCom all scheduled for release   Retail stocks saw some major volatility yesterday as Radio Shack dropped nearly 20 percent in the after market session as its fourth quarter earnings report failed to live up to market expectations  Best Buy Staples  and Align Technology were also trading lower after downward revisions to first quarter earnings forecasts for 2012 The positive stories out of Greece are helping to push the DAX and CAC futures higher  and currently showing gains of 40 and 20 points  respectively   Key macro releases for today will come with the German Retail Sales report and the German Unemployment Rate while the Eurozone Unemployment Rate and the UBS Swiss Consumption survey will also be seen later in the session   The main earnings release will come from Banco Santander  so watch the financials again as this is where we might see most of the price   title  AUD JPY  width  761  height  394    The AUD JPY is continuing its medium term uptrend  with prices showing higher lows and coming close to Fibonacci and historical resistance at 83 50   We expect prices to have some difficulty in this area  as this will be the first test but the MACD has turned bullish and is trading firmly in positive territory  so our bias is for a break higher in the coming weeks   Support is seen at 80 40 and this is also where the 100 period EMA is resting so prices are likely to be contained to the downside within these technical parameters The S P 500 is making new highs for the week and have made the initial test of the 61 8  Fibonacci retracement of the move from downward from 1330   This area matches nicely with historical levels so if we can see a 4H close above this level  we will look for a full retracement of the previous decline   Support comes in initially just below 1310 and only a break back below here will take pressure off of the topside   The MACD has just turned to positive and thisis supportive for the generally bullish bias for the index ,2012-01-31,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-push-higher-on-greek-debt-progress-112655,112655

117077,338592,SPGI,McGraw Hill   It Provides A Lot of Information,opinion,McGraw Hill Companies  MHP  looks like a good addition for the dividend growth investor  The market has historically applied a premium valuation to this company  Its historically above average earnings growth had pushed the company to trade at premium  until recently  At its current valuation  McGraw Hill sits at a fair valuation  Therefore  we believe today s price represents a sound valuation given McGraw Hill s quality and consistency    Dividend Champion   McGraw Hill Companies    A Dividend Champion is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 25 or more straight years  McGraw Hill Companies is a dividend champion that has raised its dividend every year for 39 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list   McGraw Hill announced on September 12  2011  its intention to separate into two public companies  McGraw Hill Financial  a leading provider of content and analytics to global financial markets  and McGraw Hill Education  a leading education company focused on digital learning and education services worldwide  McGraw Hill Financial s leading brands include Standard   Poor s Ratings Services  S P Capital IQ  S P Indices  Platts energy information services and J D  Power and Associates  With sales of  6 2 billion in 2011  the Corporation has approximately 23 000 employees across more than 280 offices in 40 countries  McGraw Hill Companies  A Dividend Champion with 39 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past   Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots McGraw Hill Companies  earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that McGraw Hill Companies has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 10 6   see purple circle on graph  per annum Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1  The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2  The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income McGraw Hill CompaniesThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 6 3  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of McGraw Hill Companies would have received an additional  50 576 21 in dividends that increased their total return from 6 3  to 7 7  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Champion it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for McGraw Hill Companies is 1 97  which is historically low Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  McGraw Hill Companies represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price  The important factor is that McGraw Hill Companies has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important
