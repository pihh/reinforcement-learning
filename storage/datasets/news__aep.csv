14702,236217,AEP,Europe slow to standardise electric car charging  ChargePoint,news,"By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON  Reuters    Inconsistent requirements for charging stations across Europe are keeping the infrastructure for electric cars from growing as fast as it could  the CEO of ChargePoint  one of the world s largest charging network operators  said on Tuesday 
Speaking in Lisbon at the Web Summit  Europe s largest technology conference  Pasquale Romano said the European Union was the  only governing body  able to tackle the issue 
 Germany has very specific metering requirements  Some Southern  NYSE SO  European countries require shuttered sockets  That s crazy  It s creating noise in a way that s not adding value to the drivers   he said 
 Companies like us can work around this  but it makes doing business here messier than it needs to be   he said 
ChargePoint  which operates 103 600 charging points globally  aims to increase that to 2 5 million by 2025  with the increase split evenly between Europe and the United States 
The company entered the European market in 2016  with its headquarters located in Amsterdam  joining a crowded field of oil majors  carmakers and utilities fighting to dominate the industry of electric vehicle infrastructure 
Since then  ChargePoint has hired 70 staff across the continent  with one facility in Munich and another in Reading  England  due to come into operation by the end of this year 
Most of the growth has been in Europe rather than the United States  Romano said   with the U S  climate the way it is  
The U S  government filed paperwork on Monday to withdraw the country from the Paris Agreement  the first formal step in a one year process to exit the global pact to fight climate change by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases 
ChargePoint has raised  530 million from investors in 10 funding rounds since it was founded in 2007  including  Daimler   DE DAIGn   BMW  DE BMWG  and  Siemens   DE SIEGn  in Germany  as well as U S  energy firms  Chevron   N CVX  and America Electric Power  N AEP

14706,236221,AEP,The Keys To Successfully Timing The Markets   January 24  2020,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to consistently time the market and always make a profit is the dream for most people who trade their own accounts 
Indeed  even among those investors who don t try to consistently time the markets  many think they can still call a top and act opportunistically  It s at these times when an investor who speculates often sits on the sidelines and looks for better opportunities to put money into the market 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Utilities stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  ADOMANI  Inc   ADOM   American Electric Power Company  Inc   NYSE AEP   The AES Corporation  NYSE AES   Atlantica Yield PLC  AY   Avangrid  Inc   AGR 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Many investors think of market timing success as a win or lose proposition  But there is a less notable  rather straightforward  successful market timing approach that has been utilized effectively time after time by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Attempting to time tops and bottoms is lose lose situation 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

revenues  earnings  and other financial data quarterly  and the reports generally start coming in a few weeks after each calendar quarter ends  And now it s time for the Q4 2019 reports to start coming in Earnings season always generates a spate of analyst predictions  and this time is no different  Looking back  market watchers note that 2019 saw a series of lackluster quarters   that nevertheless did not impede stock performance  Companies compensated by reducing their forward guidance and then clearing that lower bar So far  it seems that this is likely to happen once again  Bank of America s securities strategists wrote   We expect to see a 2  beat in 4Q earnings  Estimates have reset sufficiently  in our view   At the same time  analysts are expecting stock prices to continue rising  with any pullback likely to be both shallow and short lived Ahead of the earnings releases  three market giants have received recent upgrades or price target hikes from top analysts  Rating upgrades are important  as they indicate a positive change in the likely direction a stock will take   and their timing is important  too  as an upgrade shortly before an earnings release will push investor expectations Using TipRanks  Stock Comparison tool  we lined up the three alongside each other to give us an idea of what the Street thinks is in store for the trio in the year ahead American Electric Power  AEP American Electric Power is one of the largest electricity providers in the country  with over 5 million customers in 11 states  some 26 000 megawatts of generating capacity  and a market cap of  47 billion  AEP is scheduled to release fourth quarter earnings on February 20 Ahead of the print  the company is expected to show EPS of 62 cents  down 10 cents from Q4 2018  In the last three quarters  AEP has beaten the forecasts by an average of 6 7   For the full year 2019  EPS is estimated at  4 18  In Q3 2019  the last reported  AEP showed strong results  The Q3 EPS   1 46  was far ahead of the  1 33 predicted Like many utilities  AEP pays out a dividend to shareholders  The 70 cent quarterly payment annualizes to  2 80  with a yield of 2 9   This beats the average S P yield by a wide margin  and makes the stock more attractive despite a relatively low upside potential  more below   Better for investors  the company has a history of steadily increasing the dividend  and at 48   the payout ratio indicates both sustainability and room for further dividend growth A reliable business base and solid earnings gave Shelby Tucker  4 star analyst with RBC Capital  reason to upgrade his rating and price target on AEP  In his comments on the stock  Tucker pointed out the  robust rate base and earnings growth   and noted   We view AEP as having best value in the same peer group of quality utilities and see it trading at an improved multiple  Tucker moved his rating up to Buy  and increased his price to  103  from  96   His new target

maturation of the smartphone replacement cycle  slowing iPhone sales   combined to push earnings down and forced management to seek alternate strategies to maintain revenue growth  During the year  Apple shifted toward an emphasis on its Services and Wearables segments  along with revamping the Mac and iPad lines  to compensate for the decline in iPhone sales  and that strategy is bearing fruit  Outside factors   the switch to 5G  with its concomitant necessity for customers to upgrade devices  and the apparent success of President Trump s tariff strategy in forcing China into trade

strongest  and EPS is expected at  4 53  Since the December 2018 quarter  Apple has beaten earnings forecasts by increasing margins in each report Canaccord analyst Michael Walkley sees plenty of reason for optimism as Apple gears up for its January 28 earnings release  He points out Apple s market leading Wearables position  with strong growth in the Air Pods and Watch  and says as well   We believe Apple s ecosystem approach  including an installed base that exceeds 1 4B devices globally  is leading to record services revenue  and we expect the higher margin services revenue growth to continue outpacing total company growth  We are also encouraged by the strong demand for the iPhone 11 lineup and believe Apple will maintain its market share leadership of premium tier smartphones

141449,362964,AEP,Yes  You Can Time The Market  Find Out How   December 09  2019,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Utilities stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  ADOMANI  Inc   ADOM   American Electric Power Company  Inc   NYSE AEP   The AES Corporation  NYSE AES   Atlantica Yield PLC  AY   Avangrid  Inc   AGR 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during small crashes   ride the storm out  or better yet  take advantage of the opportunity 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a key distinction between a small correction and a market crash  No matter what happens in the stock market  chances are that the stocks you own will eventually come back to their pre   crash value  hanging on to your original positions  or opportunistically averaging down  during market downs can be the shrew distraction to take  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

141450,362965,AEP,3 Investing Facts About Required Minimum Distributions You Need To Know   December 17  2019,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose American Electric Power  AEP   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you hit age 70 1 2 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 70 1 2 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  The RMD you are required to take is calculated by dividing your previous year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 70 1 2  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 70 1 2

141451,362966,AEP,AEP  AEP  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"American Electric Power  AEP  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for AEP is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For AEP  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AEP
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this utility is expected to earn  4 18 per share  which is a change of 5 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AEP  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of AEP to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aep-aep-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200493158,200493158

companies said just under a quarter of a million customers were without power  Wind and rain continued to lash the coast as residents began to assess the damage  Harvey is the strongest storm to hit Texas  the center of the U S  oil and gas industry  since 1961  The seaside town of Rockport  30 miles  48 km  north of the city of Corpus Christi  was hit hard   Several homes had collapsed  and many more buildings suffered damage  Roofs had been ripped off some  and windows blown in  The streets were flooded and strewn with power lines and debris  At a recreational vehicle sales lot  a dozen vehicles were flipped over and one had been blown into the middle of the street outside   It was terrible   resident Joel Valdez  57  told Reuters  The storm ripped part of the roof from his trailer home at around 4 a m   he said   I could feel the whole house move   Valdez said he stayed through the storm to look after his animals    I have these miniature donkeys and I don t know where they are   he said  as he sat in a Jeep with windows smashed by the storm  Resident Frank Cook  56  also stayed through the storm   If you have something left of your house  you re lucky   he said  surveying the damage from his vehicle  Before the storm hit  Rockport s mayor told anyone staying behind to write their names on their arms for identification purposes in case of death or injury  A high school  hotel  senior housing complex and other buildings suffered structural damage  according to emergency officials and local media  Some were being used as shelters  The coastal city of Port Lavaca

141473,362988,AEP,Simple Market Timing Strategies That Work   November 13  2019,opinion,"In the long run  does consistent market timing really matter to be a successful investor 
In fact  even among long term investors who don t attempt to time the markets  being able to call the top of the market is a skill that many think they possess  This misguided confidence is often driving investors to sit on the sidelines and wait it out for better market opportunities 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Utilities stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Avangrid  Inc   AGR   ADOMANI  Inc   ADOM   American Electric Power Company  Inc   NYSE AEP   The AES Corporation  NYSE AES   Atlantica Yield PLC  AY 
Investment emotional triggers  fear and greed  can lead to costly mental mistakes by investors who typically fall into the trap of being a market follower instead of a market leader 
Productive market timing requires three key parts  1  A dependable sign for when to get in and out of stocks  2  The ability to follow up on the sign rapidly and precisely  3  The ability to be completely unemotional and trust in the signal no matter the current market environment 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the objective to time the tops and bottoms conclusively gives you the flexibility to profit  and extends your chance to benefit from the equity markets over the long term whether your specific market timing calls are right or wrong 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this thought one step further by often buying outsized positions in value stocks he likes across the board when markets turn  essentially leveraging his bottoms up analysis and stock picking acumen 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s only human that many succumb to greed and try and game the system by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Chasing alpha  outsized  short   term returns through market timing and other high   risk bets is acceptable only within a small part of your investable resources  however for your long   term retirement assets a  risk adjusted  investment discipline is what largely bodes well

141475,362990,AEP,Power Plants Facing Millions To Comply With EPA Rule,news,"By    Power plant owners may not have liked the Supreme Court s ruling on Tuesday  but they ve had a long time to prepare for it and it won t be as disruptive to their bottom line as they initially feared 
The Court voted 6 2 to uphold the Cross State Air Pollution Rule  an Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  regulation initiated in August 2011 that would force about 1 000 power plants to reduce operations or adopt pollution controls in order to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions linked to respiratory diseases and heart attacks  A 2012 Appeals Court decision sided with industry groups and states that opposed the rule  putting it on hold  With the high court s ruling  the EPA now has the authority to require 28 Midwest  southeastern and East Coast states to reduce power plant emissions 
But the D C  Circuit and other courts must first address a slew of related lawsuits  And the EPA may have to update data on air pollution that was used to craft the rule  as well as reschedule deadlines that were missed while the case was being litigated  This will give power plant owners more time to update their facilities or shut down 
 Essentially  it s turned out that the delays that have occurred are beneficial to many owners of power plants    because if the rule had gone into effect when it was initially scheduled  on January 1st  2012   it would have had a major disruptive effect on the utilities   Andrew Weissman  senior energy adviser for law firm Haynes and Boone  said 
In the years since the EPA s original rule was announced  many plants have closed  Plant owners and operators reported to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  in 2011 that they expect to retire about 8 5 percent of coal fired capacity through 2016  mostly in the eastern half of the country and more than four times the retirements of the preceding five year period  A record high of 10GW of coal fired capacity is expected to retire in 2015 
The Edison Electric Institute  an association of shareholder owned electric companies  forecasts that 15 percent of nationwide coal fired capacity will have retired from 2010 to 2022  not including potential retirements from future regulations 
American Electric Power  NYSE AEP   one of the nation s largest electric utilities  which delivers electricity to more than 5 million customers in 11 states  spent  415 million on environmental investments last year and expects that amount to grow to  588 million this year and  644 million in 2015  Some of the potential investments include retrofitting plants in Virginia and Kentucky with natural gas capacity  Natural gas plants emit about half the air pollution of coal fired plants 

The EPA estimated in 2011 that CSPAR would cost utility companies  800 million annually in 2014  in addition to the  1 6 billion per year power plant operators spend to comply with the Clean Air Interstate Rule  mandated in 2005  The EPA claims the costs will be outweighed by the health benefits  estimated at up to  280 billion annually starting this year 
When asked Wednesday if EPA would recalculate those costs for more up to date accuracy  an EPA spokesperson said the agency is  reviewing the decision and deciding on next steps  
The EPA is preparing to release another regulation in June to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants 
 There s definitely a lot of uncertainty right now   said Phillip Wallach of the Brookings Institution   All this time the rule has been in place  even though it was struck down in lower courts  It s been a slow moving battle  
The utility industry s fight against environmental regulations dates back to a provision on interstate pollution in the 1976 Clean Air Act 
 This has been fought at for my entire professional lifetime  and it s still not over   Weissman said ",2014-04-30,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/power-plants-facing-millions-to-comply-with-epa-rule-281057,281057

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9 77   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1  delivering a surprise of 2 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
AEP  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  4 30 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 41   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 30 billion  The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
AEP shares have added about 26 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for AEP 
While AEP has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for AEP was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 70 on  3 75 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 17 on  16 03 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Utility   Electric Power is currently in the top 29  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-electric-power-aep-tops-q3-earnings-estimates-200477417,200477417

The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Don t sell during minor crashes   instead  have the patience to weather the storm  or even better  milk the opportunity to buy low 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based off this simple rule  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea further by frequently going on purchasing binges when the markets turn  basically purchasing extra shares of his top stock picks at a major markdown and doubling   down on his very own recommendations

This utility has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 11  
For the most recent quarter  AEP was expected to post earnings of  0 98 per share  but it reported  1 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 04   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 10 per share  while it actually produced  1 19 per share  a surprise of 8 18  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for AEP  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AEP has an Earnings ESP of  6 67  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 24  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-aep-aep-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200474146,200474146
141536,363051,AEP,American Electric Power  AEP  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"American Electric Power  AEP  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 24 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 86 billion  up 12 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 4  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AEP 
For AEP  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  10 26  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that AEP will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AEP would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1  delivering a surprise of  2 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AEP appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/american-electric-power-aep-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200474693,200474693
141562,363077,AEP,How To Time The Markets Like An Investing Pro   October 03  2019,opinion,"Being that unique investor who has the power to constantly time the market and continually make a profit is the dream for most traders and investors 
Indeed  even among the individuals who don t seek to be the ideal market timer  many feel they can call a top and act in accordance  It is these tendencies that make investors sit on the sidelines and hang tight for a better chance to put money into the market 
Missed investing opportunities by exiting at the first sign of trouble is a common pattern among many self directed investors  Case in point  How many investors have missed huge opportunities waiting for the Utilities stocks listed below to correct  only to see them reach new highs  climb higher and drive the bull market to record levels  Atlantica Yield PLC  AY   The AES Corporation  NYSE AES   American Electric Power Company  Inc   NYSE AEP   ADOMANI  Inc   ADOM   Avangrid  Inc   AGR 
Dread and exuberance regularly propel investors into merely  reacting  to market volatility  rather than envisioning market trends 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
Market timing is commonly perceived as the ability to guess the exact market top or bottom and make moves accordingly  However  there is a less common  rather straightforward market timing strategy that has been utilized effectively by insightful financial specialists like Warren Buffet for a considerable length of time 
Rule 1  Never attempt and time tops and bottoms 
Abandoning the goal to time the tops and bottoms precisely gives you the flexibility to profit  thereby increasing your chances to lock in built up profits even if your calls aren t exactly right 
Rule 2  Make an effort not to sell in the midst of little crashes  Muster the courage to trust your gut and buy best in class stocks at a discount 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He cautions not to sell during little crashes  and encourages enduring them by concentrating on the long haul 
There is a big difference between a stock market crash and small correction  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But  think about this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would need to be precise 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Indeed  even a slight outperformance most likely wouldn t justify the efforts   and given that even the specialists for the most part come up short at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive methodology for investing  particularly when it comes to building your retirement nest egg 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a  risk  adjusted focused  investment solution generally makes more sense

141599,363114,AEP,How To Time The Markets Like An Investing Pro   September 12  2019,opinion,"Have you ever dreamed of being that one in a million investor who has the talent to perfectly time the markets 
Even among those who don t aspire to be the perfect market timer  many think they can call a top and act accordingly  It s at these times when investors choose to sit on the sidelines and wait for a  perceived  better opportunity to invest in the market 
Individual investors who focus their efforts on timing the market typically miss chances  For example  many investors have overlooked chances to benefit from buying the Utilities stocks at the first opportunity  by attempting to buy them during a pullback only to see these stocks accomplish new unsurpassed highs  Avangrid  Inc   AGR   Atlantica Yield PLC  AY   The AES Corporation  NYSE AES   American Electric Power Company  Inc   NYSE AEP   ADOMANI  Inc   ADOM 
Anxiety and eagerness regularly lead investors into psychological traps because most investors take cues from past market moves and trends instead of attempting to anticipate potential market moves 
Accomplished market timing requires three key components  1  A dependable sign of when to get in and out of stocks  2  The capacity to act upon signals quickly and accurately  3  Have the stomach to act on market signals  no matter how counterintuitive the move may be 
Many investors believe that market timing is a short term investment strategy  There is a less known  more effective  longer term market timing approach that has been used successfully by astute investors like Warren Buffet 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Forget tracking for market tops or bottoms to expand your odds for success with a longer timeline and give yourself the flexibility to eventually profit  regardless of whether your calls are spot on or way off base 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made his fortune based of this straightforward guideline  He warns not to sell during small crashes  and weather the storm by focusing on the long term 
There is a major distinction between a financial crash and a mild market reset  If you own shares of a company that is well   established and has strong fundamentals  they are probably going to rebound to their pre   crash prices eventually  thereby rendering holding on a wise decision  Warren Buffett takes this thought a notch higher and frequently goes on a buying binge when markets turn  purchasing additional shares of his favorite stocks at a major markdown and tuning in to his own recommendation of being greedy when others are scared  and being scared when others are greedy 
A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed for Your Retirement Assets
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

141600,363115,AEP,Trump s Impeachment Looms Large Over Markets  5 Safe Picks,opinion,U S  stocks took a beating after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry into President Trump  This followed reports that Trump sought foreign help to damage the reputation of a political rival  The President has been accused of having withheld economic aid to Ukraine in order to build pressure on officials at Kiev to come up with disturbing information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden  Lest we forget  Biden s son Hunter Biden has business dealings with Ukraine Meanwhile  we have seen markets behave differently during major impeachments in the recent past  For instance  during the Nixon saga  stocks were hit but that was also because the economy was headed into a recession  On the other hand  markets moved north despite Bill Clinton s impeachment  thanks to a sturdy economy This clears one thing  the stock market is largely affected by the current state of the economy apart from the impeachment threat  Downbeat consumer confidence data plays a major role here The ebb and flow of U S  China trade tensions have dented investors  sentiment to a large extent  The trade tussle is widely expected to take a toll on manufacturing and farming as well as threaten the record U S  economic expansion  According to the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index dropped to a three month low of 125 1 this month from 134 2 in August  Consumers aren t feeling confident about their present condition  while the so called expectations index fell to 95 8 from 106 4  the lowest reading since January The trade war has undoubtedly affected the global economy as well  The Fed did try to lend support to the domestic economy by trimming key benchmark rates  but business leaders believe that things won t improve unless the countries in disagreement make serious efforts to tamp down tensions through constructive deals Talking about trade  Trump recently accused China of manipulating its currency and stealing intellectual property  in a U N  speech  And now we all can gauge where trade negotiations are headed  and what the fate of equities will be in the near future  To add to the bearish sentiments  any impeachment proceedings may affect Trump s re election bid  making way for a less business friendly Democratic administration How to Prepare for the Slump Given the aforesaid factors  it seems like the Wall Street is in for trouble  During times like this  investors should ideally focus on low risk assets that are protected by a combination of parameters for better returns  The best way to go about this is by picking low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 These stocks are also dividend payers which boast immense financial strength and are immune to market vagaries 5 Ultra Safe PicksWe have  thus  selected five such stocks that boast a Zacks Rank  1

141601,363116,AEP,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why American Electric Power  AEP  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at American Electric Power  AEP   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  American Electric Power currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AEP that show why this utility shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For AEP  shares are up 1 79  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 1 47  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 13  compares favorably with the industry s 3 31  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of American Electric Power have increased 4 54  over the past quarter  and have gained 36 63  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 2 83  and 4 35   respectively 
Investors should also take note of AEP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  AEP is averaging 2 182 755 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AEP 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AEP s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 13 to  4 14 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that AEP is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep American Electric Power on your short list ",2019-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-american-electric-power-aep-is-a-great-choice-200468315,200468315

Lost chances by those who attempt to time the market is a common mistake among those who trade their own accounts  How many traders have lost investing opportunities by choosing to wait for the Utilities stocks to correct or reach attractive entry levels  Only for them to continue to move higher and achieve new all time highs  The AES Corporation  NYSE AES   American Electric Power Company  Inc   NYSE AEP   ADOMANI  Inc   ADOM   Avangrid  Inc   AGR   Atlantica Yield PLC  AY 
Fear and greed often lead investors into behavioral traps since most investors are followers who react  rather than anticipate market moves 
Successful market timing requires three key ingredients  1  A reliable signal to tell you when to get in and out of stocks  or bonds  gold or other types of investments   2  The ability to interpret the signal correctly  3  The discipline to act on it 
The popular image of market timing is that it calls for making drastic  all or nothing moves at the precise  exact market top or bottom  There is a less well known  rather simple market timing approach that has been used successfully by savvy investors like Warren Buffet for decades 
Rule 1  Never try and time tops and bottoms 
Surrendering the objective to time the tops and bottoms gives you the adaptability to benefit and increase your odds to secure profits over the long term  even if your calls aren t always right 
Rule 2  Try not to sell amid little crashes   instead exploit the opportunity by buying 
Warren Buffett has made an incredible piece of his fortune because of this basic standard  He benefits by focusing on the long   term and buying high quality stocks at a discount during large market corrections to profit down the road 
There is a noteworthy distinction between a complete market meltdown and a common 10  market correction  The theory is that if you like and bought a stock at a previous valuation prior to the correction  you should love the opportunity to this same at a steep discount since the underlying fundamentals are most likely still intact  Warren Buffett takes this idea one step further and often goes on a buying spree when markets turn  essentially buying additional shares of his top stock picks at a big discount and listening to his own advice   Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful  
When It Comes to Trading Your Retirement  A Risk Adjusted Trading Strategy Should be Followed
It s just human that many surrender to emotions and attempt and game the framework by timing the market  But consider this  Nobel Laureate William Sharpe found in 1975 that a market timer would have to be accurate 74  of the time to beat a passive portfolio  Even a slight outperformance probably wouldn t be worth the energy   and given that even the experts generally fail at it  market timing shouldn t be your exclusive investing strategy of choice  especially using assets earmarked for your retirement 
Actively trading for alpha  outsized  short   term gains through market timing and other high   risk trading strategies is fine with a small portion of your investable assets  but for your longer   term retirement assets  a risk  adjusted focused investment solution generally makes more sense

141724,363239,AEP,What Makes AEP  AEP  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"American Electric Power  AEP  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for AEP basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For AEP  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for AEP
This utility is expected to earn  4 15 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 5 1  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for AEP  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

141725,363240,AEP,Analysts Estimate American Electric Power  AEP  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when American Electric Power  AEP  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3  
Revenues are expected to be  4 24 billion  up 5 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 83  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AEP 
For AEP  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AEP will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AEP would post earnings of  1 10 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 19  delivering a surprise of  8 18  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  AES is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while American Electric Power has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AES is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
AES currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 58  while AEP has a forward P E of 20 44  We also note that AES has a PEG ratio of 1 74  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  AEP currently has a PEG ratio of 3 61

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 10 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 6  
Revenues are expected to be  4 46 billion  up 10 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 49  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AEP 
For AEP  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 53  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AEP will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AEP would post earnings of  0 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 72  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Currently  both Southern Co  and American Electric Power are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
SO currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 14  while AEP has a forward P E of 18 81  We also note that SO has a PEG ratio of 3 37  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AEP currently has a PEG ratio of 3 38 
Another notable valuation metric for SO is its P B ratio of 1 74  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  AEP has a P B of 1 93 
These metrics  and several others  help SO earn a Value grade of B  while AEP has been given a Value grade of C 
Both SO and AEP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that SO is the superior value option right now ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/so-vs-aep-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200356186,200356186
142132,363647,AEP,American Electric Power Q1 Review,opinion,"Summary
American Electric Power Company Inc  NYSE AEP  had a good quarter  most subsidiaries had increased revenue 
Most jurisdictions where they operate in granted base rate increases 
The company continues to make the transition from coal fired to renewable power 
 This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community  Turning Points  
American Electric Power    is the fifth largest electric utility with a market capitalization of  34 billion  Out of 53 other electric utilities 

They have the 21st higher PE  18 43 
They have the 25th highest forward PE  17 43 
They have the 24th highest dividend  3 52 0

They have operations in Texas  Michigan  Ohio  Appalachia  Indiana  and Oklahoma 
Before getting to the financials  let s look at the highlights of their quarterly report 

Retail sales volume increased 1 5 
Industrial sales rose 2 5 
Their biggest problem is still their dependence on coal for power generation  13 500 MW of their 25 600 MW of generation comes from coal  The company copiously documents that  due to several sets of federal regulations  this will increase their compliance costs going forward 
Their Texas operations will face  325  375 million in damages related to Hurrican Harvey
They received a  49 million dollar base rate increase from Michigan
Louisiana granted a  31 million dollar base rate increase
Kentucky approved a  12 million dollar base rate increased
Texas approved a  50 million dollar base rate increase 

Let s next look at their financials  starting with the division of their revenue 

Vertically integrated utilities are responsible for about half of their business  transmission accounts for 27  while Transmission Holdco makes up a bulk of the remainder  Generation and marketing earnings were  186 million in 2017 but this was artificially inflated by the sale of assets  The point of the above table is to show that AEP has a diverse revenue base 
Let s next turn to their operations 

 from their latest 10 K 
Revenue for the vertically integrated utility section rose a little over 5   Operating income was noticable lower but that was due to higher maintenance and depreciation expenses  Thanks to a lower income tax expense  it dropped by 37    earnings were higher this quarter 
Next up is their transmission and distribution business 
Revenues increased a healty 7   As with the vertically integrated utility subsidiary  higher maintenance and depreciation expenses ate into profits  But  again  lower taxes let more income hit the bottom line 

Generation and marketing revenue was down but that was due to 2017 being high due to an asset sale 
There was one odd piece of cost data which occurred in their Appalachian operation 

The cost of electricity purchased for resale more than doubled  Management offered no explanation for this increase 
Finally  the stock is currently in an uptrend 

There are several reasons for the sell off that started in mid December  Treasury yields started to rise  which sent interest rate sensitive sectors lower  Then prices followed the broader market lower in late January s sell off  Prices have been moving higher since  The current rally is very disciplined  And  the MACD is rising and just gave a second buy signal 
Conclusion  AEP remains a very solid utility  They have exposure to a large number of markets  giving them geographic diversity  They received adequate rate increases and expenses are under control  Their only problem is exposure to coal plants  They are working to develop cleaner generation facilities  but that transition will take time and money

142311,363826,AEP,Utility Industry Outlook   May 2017,opinion,"The Utility sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for utility services is generally immune to the vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand  While these businesses are not  growthy  in the traditional sense  but the stability and visibility of their earnings and cash flows allow them to pay out consistent dividends  which adds to their attractiveness to income oriented investors 
To maintain an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities  utilities need to upgrade and strengthen their infrastructure and modernize the generation fleet  Water utilities in particular are positioned for massive growth as billions of dollars in regulated investment are required to upgrade soiled and old water infrastructure 
Apart from generating electricity  electric utilities focus on strengthening transmission and distribution lines  Meanwhile  natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver the product to the end users  So to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure  utilities depend on capital markets 
These capital intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the above requirements  Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects  Utilities have been benefiting from the rock bottom interest rate environment  However  the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for two consecutive quarters  Dec 2016 and Mar 2017   which will certainly hurt utilities 
The Fed may raise interest rates again in 2017 if the economic factors are conducive  If the cost of capital increases further for utilities  investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment 
However  utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which give their revenues a high level of certainty  They also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been a headwind for many other industries lately  Utilities are also gaining from customer growth  proper cost control and the latest electric rates  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  is up 6 16  year over year  as of May 12  2017  
President Trump   Clean Power Plan
Historically  electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  In line with this  in Aug 2015  President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32  by 2030 from 2005 levels 
To adhere to the Clean Power Plan  some utilities had taken steps to bring down emission levels  which included the shutting down of old coal based power plants  investing in emission control equipment  and increasing the share of natural gas and alternate energy sources in electricity generation 
There was  however  strong opposition to the enforcement of Clean Power Plan  as a large group felt it was too harsh and will have an adverse impact on industries like coal apart from utilities 
The Supreme Court ruling in Feb 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of this Clean Power Plan and blocked the efforts of the U S  administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal fired power plants 
President Trump acted on his pre election promises and has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan  Trump believes that such plans will make U S  manufacturing non competitive in the global markets  The move toward repealing the Clean Power Plan will benefit coal focused electric utilities like American Electric Power Company  NYSE AEP   AEP  
Even if these amendments take time to be implemented  it will benefit coal based utilities as they will able to run their units for a longer period than expected earlier

142312,363827,AEP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  American Electric Power  CenterPoint Energy  ONE Gas And Telephone And Data Systems,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 19  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Utilities  Part 1  including American Electric Power Company  NYSE AEP   NYSE         CenterPoint Energy Inc  NYSE CNP    NYSE         ONE Gas  Inc   NYSE        and Telephone and Data Systems  Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Utilities  Part 1

	Link  

	The Utility sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for utility services is generally immune to the vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand  While these businesses are not  growthy  in the traditional sense  but the stability and visibility of their earnings and cash flows allow them to pay out consistent dividends  which adds to their attractiveness to income oriented investors 

	To maintain an uninterrupted supply of basic amenities  utilities need to upgrade and strengthen their infrastructure and modernize the generation fleet  Water utilities in particular are positioned for massive growth as billions of dollars in regulated investment are required to upgrade soiled and old water infrastructure 

	Apart from generating electricity  electric utilities focus on strengthening transmission and distribution lines  Meanwhile  natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver the product to the end users  So to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure  utilities depend on capital markets 

	These capital intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the above requirements  Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects  Utilities have been benefiting from the rock bottom interest rate environment  However  the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for two consecutive quarters  Dec 2016 and Mar 2017   which will certainly hurt utilities 

	The Fed may raise interest rates again in 2017 if the economic factors are conducive  If the cost of capital increases further for utilities  investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment 

	However  utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which give their revenues a high level of certainty  They also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been a headwind for many other industries lately  Utilities are also gaining from customer growth  proper cost control and the latest electric rates  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  is up 6 16  year over year  as of May 12  2017  

President Trump   Clean Power Plan

	Historically  electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  In line with this  in Aug 2015  President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32  by 2030 from 2005 levels 

	To adhere to the Clean Power Plan  some utilities had taken steps to bring down emission levels  which included the shutting down of old coal based power plants  investing in emission control equipment  and increasing the share of natural gas and alternate energy sources in electricity generation 

	There was  however  strong opposition to the enforcement of Clean Power Plan  as a large group felt it was too harsh and will have an adverse impact on industries like coal apart from utilities 

	The Supreme Court ruling in Feb 2016 temporarily stayed the implementation of this Clean Power Plan and blocked the efforts of the U S  administration to lower global warming by regulating emissions from coal fired power plants 

	President Trump acted on his pre election promises and has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan  Trump believes that such plans will make U S  manufacturing non competitive in the global markets  The move toward repealing the Clean Power Plan will benefit coal focused electric utilities like American Electric Power Company  NYSE        

	Even if these amendments take time to be implemented  it will benefit coal based utilities as they will able to run their units for a longer period than expected earlier 

Zacks Industry Rank   Neutral

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  utilities are a standalone sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  The rural wire line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector  but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power  Gas Distribution and Water Supply 

	We rank all of the 257 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available in the

	Note that each of the three industries related to the utility sector   Gas Distribution  Water Supply and Electric Power   falls under the second category  with a Zacks Industry Rank of  109   153 and  166  respectively 

	Our present outlook for the utility sector is Neutral  with all the three major industries placed in the middle third of the Zacks Industry Rank

American Electric Power has been moving higher since October  But the recent pullback since late April is finding support and gives a good reward to risk trade higher  The RSI is turning back up but with the MACD continuing lower 

Altera Corporation  NASDAQ ALTR 

Altera is a bottoming play  it is trying to reverse off of support at 31 50 32  The RSI is rising along with the MACD as price is finding support at the high volume bar 

BP  NYSE BP 

BP is a stock we have had a long position is for quite some time  Last week made a higher low and is breaking out higher  The RSI is bullish and the MACD reversing higher after a short fall off 

CIT Group Inc  NYSE CIT 

CIT Group is reversing up after fining support at 41 50  The RSI is rising and the MACD is rising and crossed up  supporting more upside  There is a large gap to fill to the upside 

Express Scripts Holding Company  NASDAQ ESRX 

Express Scripts gapped lower following earnings  but has been rising ever since  The current consolidation at the 200 day SMA in a bull flag has support for a move higher from the rising RSI and MACD  which has also crossed up 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into Memorial Day Weekend  and the official start of  work 4 days and then head to the Hamptons  the equity markets have recovered a bit but not turned around fully  Look for Gold to continue its consolidation while Crude Oil remains biased higher  The US Dollar Index and US Treasuries also look higher with Treasuries perhaps ready for another short term pullback  The Shanghai Composite looks to consolidate over 2000 and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside  Volatility looks to subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their individual charts tell a different story with all in consolidation including the SPY  but the QQQ s biased higher while the IWM is biased lower  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

142492,364007,AEP,Competition May Arise For Near Term U S  Producers ,opinion,There is a titanic battle that has been mounted against nuclear energy by the proponents of coal and natural gas smearing the new nuclear reactors that are being built at this very moment all over the world  especially in the emerging European and Asian Nations  There are big bucks involved by the forces that have chosen to tar nuclear as the result of the once in a millennium perfect storm emanating from the Post Fukushima mindset It is difficult to recall if any other industry has suffered the insults arising from those forces that have it in their self interest to misrepresent with claims of  unlimited cheap natural gas  solar and wind   They paint atomic energy with the slanted brush of distortion as if it is a kind of inverse Darwinism representing the survival of the uninformed  Whether this media misinterpretation is intentional or just plain ignorance is debatable  Suffice it to say  the forces of fossil fuels  solar and wind are fighting and increasingly losing battle in a book that might be entitled   Alice In Blunderland  The rising power of nuclear energy  NLR  represents not only the wave of the future  but is proliferating in front of the very noses of the naysayers in nuclear  It is as if they are caught in the time warp of the 1970 s  It is fossilized thinking for an increasingly fossilized sector We recognize that the nuclear plants built in the 1970 s are as far removed from current reality as the neanderthals are from modern man  Attention must be paid to the resurrection and viability of nuclear plant construction  which has relegated the old nuclear mindset to the dustbins of history It is time for us to realize that the world has been awakening to the rise of nuclear power in the battle for energy survival  Simply put  the current generation of atomic energy is producing modern  safe  portable and less expensive nuclear generators It is time to recognize that we must disenthrall ourselves from the old mindsets that are being entombed before our very eyes by contemporary visionaries who are moving full speed ahead  leaving bureaucrats and negators behind A few statistics are in order here  Massey Energy underwent a blow up that killed at least 29 coal miners in West Virginia  The Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  slammed coal mining with the largest fine to date for the 2007 accident that exploded as the worst U S  mining catastrophe in forty years MSHA concluded that the disaster was entirely preventable We hardly hear about these indictments of coal in comparison to the deluge of post Fukushima adverse publicity  What about the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf Of Mexico which killed eleven workers and sparked the worst offshore oil spill in modern history  We witnessed internecine warfare between fossil fuel giants BP and Halliburton  blaming each other for the Deepwater Horizon disaster This is partial vindication of what we have been writing about for many years  Cameco  the largest publicly owned uranium company  warns that there will be a shortfall in the availability of uranium as the world increasingly reveals the supply shortage for nuclear ore  Companies have been frustrated raising capital for new projects  BHP has delayed their Olympic Dam expansion and selling off uranium assets to Cameco  who is looking to double their production Increasingly these mining slowdowns have limited potential supply  Add to this the ending of the Russian HEU Agreement in 2013  which will further limit uranium supplies to the United States  which happens to be the largest consumer of uranium for its nuclear reactors Remember Cameco backed away from the Hathor deal as Rio Tinto outbid them  They have stated publicly that this will not deter them in their ongoing quest for producing nuclear ore right here in the United States Very important developments are taking place in the undervalued uranium miners  Paladin signed a long term off take agreement with a major utility  The company will deliver close to 14 million pounds of uranium and will receive a cash of  200 million by January 2013  This has major implications on this overlooked sector  which is showing signs of a positive reversal higher  Many of our uranium selections are breaking downtrends and should see higher prices as liquidity and capital flows into this undervalued sector with excellent supply demand fundamentals over the long term Indeed  one of our selections Uranerz  URZ  has already begun construction on its large Nichols Ranch property in the mining friendly state of Wyoming and is beginning a major breakout past  1 60 Production is scheduled for the second half of 2012  Cameco has announced that they will be actively searching for North American companies on the cusp of production  Uranerz lies directly in the proximity of not only Cameco  but Uranium One as well in the Powder River Basin  Do not forget the Russians and Asians are donning cowboy hats in Wyoming looking for their next target Already  Uranerz has entered into a pact with Cameco to refine Uranerz s production at its nearby Smith Ranch right down the road  Cameco has expressed its need for uranium ore especially out of Wyoming  where it has not met its production targets We believe that Uranerz can fulfill Cameco s needs  Cameco must act soon as there are other hungry giants in this area including Uranium One and don t be surprised if Rio Tinto or an Asian consortium enters a bid A competition may arise for near term producers  China is on record that they have every intention of becoming a major player as they focus on the new western AP 1000 technology developed by U S  based Westinghouse in clean  economical and safer plants as opposed to the antiquated CPR 1000  The need for uranium globally remains imperative Uranerz  URZ NYSE  satisfies these ravenous demands  They possess impressive acreage in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming which can only add to the attractiveness to a potential suitor Uranerz found support along its upward three year trendline as the long term weekly chart makes a bullish reversal  We are witnessing a pattern of higher lows as the 10 week  50 day  moving average begins to slope upward indicating that the short term trend is improving  This may be indicating a bottoming formation similar to July of 2010 and March of 2009 when Uranerz ran from  1 a share to  6 a share  History may not repeat  but it usually mimics We may witness an overload of the U S  power system similar to what we recently saw in India  Our power grid and infrastructure needs a major refurbishing  Questions may be raised as to why nuclear energy has been treated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation as an orphan child For the first time in American History coal capacity is being reduced  Sooner or later  bureaucrats will awaken to the new generation of safer  cheaper and efficient nuclear which could have obviated brown outs and black outs when the lights go out as they have in the past and threaten to become prevalent in the future Finally  the fine hand of Iran is adding to the possibility that the price of oil may be used as a counter stratagem to destabilize the entire Middle East cauldron  as the Arab Spring morphs into the Islamist Winter  We note the recent attacks on our U S  embassies in Cairo and Benghazi  on the anniversary of 9 11  which resulted in the death of Americans  a U S  Ambassador and the tearing down of the U S  flags which were replaced with Al Qaeda emblems Should this continue to occur across the Middle East then there may well be a spike in all forms of energy  especially uranium which is selling at a fraction from its peak in 2007  If Iran mounts a Middle East counter offensive and possibly chokes off the Straits of Hormuz  perdition may break loose as all commodities may spike putting urgent strains on an already weak Western economy This may be the reason why Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are going full speed ahead in constructing nuclear reactors to counteract the inaction of the world which is allowing Iran to move full speed ahead  Stay tuned as I will be publishing an update on gold  silver and the miners which appear to be making key long term breakouts as we write Disclosure  Long
