11442,232957,CNS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cable One  Cincinnati Financial  Cohen   Steers  DICK S Sporting Goods And Hilltop Holdings,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 4  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Cable One  Inc    NYSE CABO    Cincinnati Financial Corp    NASDAQ CINF    Cohen   Steers  Inc    NYSE CNS    DICK S Sporting Goods  Inc    NYSE DKS   and Hilltop Holdings Inc    NYSE HTH   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  5 Best Stocks to Buy in the Middle of a Bull Bear Tug o  WarThe U S  stock market has been doing pretty good lately  having only climbed north so far this fall  The rally helped the broader S P 500 rise more than 9  between Oct 2 and the end of November  The index touched 11 record highs last month  with rare sell offs But this uptick isn t built on fundamentals  which makes the stock market more susceptible to sudden pullbacks  After all  the broader market is gaining on hopes that there will be a preliminary trade agreement between the United States and China in the coming two week period  And market pundits are hopeful that the worst is over  Needless to say  any change in macro factors will disrupt the market s upward journey That s exactly what happened during last day s trading session  Almost all major bourses witnessed their steepest one day fall in almost eight weeks on Dec 2  A comeback of trade fears and weak domestic manufacturing numbers dented investors  sentiments Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that the Trump administration is prepared to impose more duties on Chinese commodities in the absence of any trade deal  Ross said that the imposition of the 15  tariff on consumer goods from China is drawing nearer Ross also reminded that Dec 15 is the  logical deadline  for a phase one deal  Lest we forget  disputes related to intellectual property theft had earlier affected trade deals between China and the United States as they scramble to reach a deal To top it  U S  manufacturing isn t in good shape either  American factory activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November  according to the Institute for Supply Management  The purchasing managers  index came in at 48 1  lower than economists  expectations of 49 2  By the way  any reading under 50 implies contraction From the new orders index  inventories index to employment index  all took a hit  It s widely expected that the confusion over trade is hampering the overall U S  manufacturing sector  To make matters worse  October construction outlays underperformed  down 0 8  against expectations of a 0 4  uptick However  bullish investors argue that trade related headlines can t dominate market sentiments forever  December has traditionally been the best for S P 500 investors  From 1950  the S P 500 Index has been up in 50 Decembers and down just 18 times  per Stock Trader s Almanac This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year  This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader s Almanac  And this time around  consumers have shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more  This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally The Winning StrategyAs the broader market struggles for direction  smart investors should simply look for stocks that provide superb risk adjusted returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 But even though low beta stocks pose less risk  they provide lower returns  So  in order to boost your returns  we have zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision  usually in the past two month period  Rising earnings estimates generally indicate that the stock will outperform the market in the near future  After all  earnings estimates are one of the most powerful metrics that measures the fundamental strength of the company  To top it  these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see the complete list of

11670,233185,CNS,5 Best Stocks To Buy In The Middle Of A Bull   Bear Tug of War,opinion,The U S  stock market has been doing pretty good lately  having only climbed north so far this fall  The rally helped the broader S P 500 rise more than 9  between Oct 2 and the end of November  The index touched 11 record highs last month  with rare sell offs But this uptick isn t built on fundamentals  which makes the stock market more susceptible to sudden pullbacks  After all  the broader market is gaining on hopes that there will be a preliminary trade agreement between the United States and China in the coming two week period  And market pundits are hopeful that the worst is over  Needless to say  any change in macro factors will disrupt the market s upward journey That s exactly what happened during last day s trading session  Almost all major bourses witnessed their steepest one day fall in almost eight weeks on Dec 2  A comeback of trade fears and weak domestic manufacturing numbers dented investors  sentiments Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently said that the Trump administration is prepared to impose more duties on Chinese commodities in the absence of any trade deal  Ross said that the imposition of the 15  tariff on consumer goods from China is drawing nearer Ross also reminded that Dec 15 is the  logical deadline  for a phase one deal  Lest we forget  disputes related to intellectual property theft had earlier affected trade deals between China and the United States as they scramble to reach a deal To top it  U S  manufacturing isn t in good shape either  American factory activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November  according to the Institute for Supply Management  The purchasing managers  index came in at 48 1  lower than economists  expectations of 49 2  By the way  any reading under 50 implies contraction From the new orders index  inventories index to employment index  all took a hit  It s widely expected that the confusion over trade is hampering the overall U S  manufacturing sector  To make matters worse  October construction outlays underperformed  down 0 8  against expectations of a 0 4  uptick However  bullish investors argue that trade related headlines can t dominate market sentiments forever  December has traditionally been the best for S P 500 investors  From 1950  the S P 500 Index has been up in 50 Decembers and down just 18 times  per Stock Trader s Almanac This is entirely because of the Santa Claus Rally or the rise in prices in the final six days of the year  This term was first coined by market analyst Yale Hirsch in 1972 in The Stock Trader s Almanac  And this time around  consumers have shown confidence in their financial future and are prepared to spend more  This is usually what triggers a Santa Claus rally The Winning StrategyAs the broader market struggles for direction  smart investors should simply look for stocks that provide superb risk adjusted returns  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 But even though low beta stocks pose less risk  they provide lower returns  So  in order to boost your returns  we have zeroed in on stocks that have seen positive earnings estimate revision  usually in the past two month period  Rising earnings estimates generally indicate that the stock will outperform the market in the near future  After all  earnings estimates are one of the most powerful metrics that measures the fundamental strength of the company  To top it  these stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Cable One  Inc    NYSE CABO   owns and operates cable systems that provide

fiscal 2019  Legg Mason reported total revenues of  2 9 billion  down 8  year over year  reflecting reduced advisory fee along with distribution and service fee revenues  and lower non pass through and pass through performance fees  Revenues almost came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Legg Mason s total adjusted operating revenues in the reported quarter came in at  588 5 million  down 9 8  year over year  The fall mainly resulted from lower non pass performance fees and reduced average long term AUM  Further  the revenue figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  700 million Investment advisory fees slipped 11 9  year over year to  618 9 million in the quarter  Distribution and service fees were down 10 4  year over year to  72 5 million  In addition  other revenues declined 20  year over year to  1 2 million Operating expenses declined 10 3  to  614 5 million on a year over year basis  This downside chiefly resulted from lower compensation and benefits  distribution and servicing and other costs Non operating expense was  2 8 million  significantly down year over year Adjusted operating margin of Legg Mason was 17 1  in the March end quarter  down from the 23 8  recorded in the prior year quarter Assets PositionAs of Mar 31  2019  Legg Mason s AUM was  758 billion  slightly up year over year from  754 1 billion  Of the total AUM  fixed income

other of  39 2 billion  These were partly countered by liquidity outflows of  8 1 billion and  0 3 billion in realizations Notably  long term flows included equity outflows of  1 billion  offset by fixed income inflows of  0 1 billion and alternative inflows of  0 9 billion Additionally  average AUM was  748 7 billion compared with  766 9 billion witnessed in the year earlier quarter and  739 3

12611,234126,CNS,Why Cohen   Steers  CNS  Might Surprise This Earnings Season,opinion,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Cohen   Steers  Inc    NYSE CNS   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report 
That is because Cohen   Steers is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CNS in this report 
In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 52 cents per share for CNS  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate at 51 cents per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CNS  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1 96  heading into earnings season COHEN STRS INC Price and EPS Surprise   Why is this Important 
A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   
Given that CNS has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  
Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cohen   Steers  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report

12632,234147,CNS,Small Cap Biotech Catalyst Watch And Trade List,opinion,Below  I have listed 5 biotechs with near term fundamental catalysts that should see their respective prices on the move  I also list the chart for each company and offer my price target opinions based on both the fundamental catalyst and technical indicators  Fundamental factors almost always trump chart technicals  so I use the charts as a  guide  to base my entry and exit points of any trade investment  GTX  GTXI  engages in the discovery  development  and commercialization of small molecules for the treatment of cancer  cancer supportive care  and other serious medical conditions  GTx is expecting to release topline data from the two pivotal clinical trials termed POWER 1 and POWER 2 for enobosarm  Ostarine   GTx 024  sometime by late July early August  Enobosarm is an oral selective androgen receptor modulator that GTx is developing for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with non small cell lung cancer  Both of the pivotal trials were placebo controlled  double blinded  and were fully enrolled by the 4th quarter of 2012  The data from these trials are of the utmost importance for patients with muscle wasting because there is currently no approved treatment  Because Insiders hold 69 28  of the company s shares  the risk of share holder dilution before the trial data catalyst is presented is highly unlikely  Capital raises via share holder dilution is certainly a huge killer of a stock s momentum  Joseph Hyde  the former Chief Executive Officer of Autozone and director of the FedEx Corporation  is currently on GTx s board of directors and is the largest shareholder  He holds 9 405 014 shares of GTx  with a current market value of over  42 500 000  Jack Schuler  the former President and Chief Operating Officer of Abbott Laboratories  ABT   also owns 6 954 144 shares  with a current market value of over  31 500 000  It s important to note that neither of these heavily invested insiders has sold a single share within the last year  In fact  they have continually added  with the most recent acquisition as close as March 31  2013  by Joseph Hyde  Considering the significant unmet need potential in treating muscle wasting along with huge insider ownership  I estimate the stock price of GTx to appreciate to around  8 50 a share before the results of the data are announced by early August  which I expect to be positive  I really like the GTx chart setup above  as just about every indicator points to a breakout  especially the relative strength index  RSI  touching a possible breakout point   7 75 looks to be the next stop  with some buying resistance at  7 50  I look for a new trading range between  7 30 and  7 75 to emerge soon with GTx  I consider GTx to be one of the better biotech catalyst trades around  and with a good data release  a move to over  11 seems likely to me  which would place its market cap over  700M    still undervalued based on the strong unmet need here  Trius Therapeutics  TSRX  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative antibiotics for serious  life threatening infections  Trius is developing Tedizolid for the treatment of   including methicillin resistant Staphlyococcus aureus  MRSA   After presenting   Trius is expecting to file an NDA in the second half of 2013  The company states in its   After successfully completing and reporting positive top line results for our ESTABLISH 2 study  we are preparing to file our New Drug Application  NDA  for tedizolid later this year and  if approved  to potentially launch in the U S  in the second half of 2014  Tedizolid demonstrated several advantages over many of the approved therapies that are making billions on the market  With a market cap of about  413M  Trius is still under speculation valued  There has also been some buzz that Trius might get bought out by a large pharmaceutical company sometime before year s end  It is my opinion that Trius continues its run in 2013  and could see a year end price nearing  15 a share once investors fully do their due diligence on it  For some time  the Trius stock saw strong resistance at  8 50  After finally breaking through this resistance  the stock rallied top  9 25  before many traders and investors took profits  It strongly appears the former area of resistance here has become support     8 50 a share  Much like GTx  the indicators seem to be suggesting that a breakout might be coming  I look for a move back to around  9 25  which is now a new area of resistance  If heavy buy side volume comes into the stock  we could easily see a move past resistance  and possibly a test of  9 50  Insmed  INSM  focuses on developing and commercializing targeted inhalation therapies for patients battling serious lung diseases  Insmed is expecting to report Phase III trial results for Arikace to treat cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas lung infections by July  as suggested in the company s recent   Completed the patient treatment period of the Company s registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of ARIKACE  the Company s Iiposomal amikacin for inhalation  to treat cystic fibrosis  CF  patients with Pseudomonas lung infections in Europe and Canada and remain on track to report top line clinical results from the trial in mid 2013  In 2012  treatments for pseudomonas lung infections in CF generated about  424 million in sales  with Novartis capturing about  317 million from TOBI and Gilead Sciences  Cayston capturing  107 million  If Phase III trials are successful and the drug is ultimately approved  Insmed should be able to capture a large portion of the market share  Insmed has had a nice run recently  from around  8 a share to over  14 20  mostly propelled by a Lazard Capital Markets analyst  on the stock with a  Buy  rating and a price target of  21 per share  The analyst believes that Arikace could realize revenues of more than  600 million a year by 2020  Insmed currently trades at  12 76  so there could be some additional price appreciation here  possibly back to the  13 level  Insmed technical indicators seem to indicate a flat trend  with a possible move to slightly over  13  The purple line shows a bit too much distribution to allow for strong price appreciation  However  if data presented with Insmed is good  the stock can certainly resume a strong up trend  Progenics Pharmaceuticals  PGNX  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for patients with cancer  Progenics is developing an antibody drug conjugate  ADC  therapy for prostate cancer that binds to prostate specific membrane antigen  PSMA   On June 10  Progenics  positive data for two of its oncology products at the 2013 Annual meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging  SNMMI   Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs for Progenics   Ongoing studies of product candidates targeted to PSMA  an enzyme expressed on the neovasculature of almost all prostate cancer cells  potentially could lead to the development of highly specific prostate cancer imaging and treatment options  We are developing candidates that could improve outcomes for cancer patients  including the two candidates featured here at SNMMI in oral presentations as well as our phase 2 stage PSMA antibody drug conjugate  Progenics believes that its technology also has the potential to work on solid tumors and other types of cancers  This news is significant for the company which should allow Progenic stock to continue its momentum upwards in the coming months  The company is also waiting on an announcement of an Advisory Committee for RELISTOR subcutaneous injection  which is indicated for opioid induced constipation  Executive Vice President Bill Forbes   While it is not possible to definitively determine the duration of the appeal process  at this time  we continue to believe a conclusion could be reached during 2013  Relistor has been available to patients with advanced illness who suffer from OIC since 2008  Although there is no set date for the announcement  this news would serve as a significant catalyst for investors  With a market cap of only  245M  Progenics seems under speculation valued  I believe that we continue to see nice price appreciation throughout the rest of this year   The above chart shows me a swallow ascending wedge  which is a period of a down trend in a stock price  The recent larger yellow candle above could indicate a reversal of the descending pattern  which would put pressure on shorts to cover  Based on the strong purple line accumulation and blue line money flow index  I think Progenics could see a price approaching  6 soon  which is the resistance point that started the current down channel wedge  Supernus Pharmaceuticals  SUPN  is a pharmaceutical company that develops products for central nervous system  CNS  disorders  It is focused on treating unmet medical needs in epilepsy  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD   and depression  The company is developing Trokendi XR  which is a novel once daily extended release formulation of topiramate  Supernus was given  for Trokendi XR because Topamax has exclusivity until June 22  2013  Chief Executive Officer   As expected and as previously communicated  most recently during our May 13  2013 quarterly earnings call  since this approval was granted before the June 22  2013 date of expiration of the Topamax data exclusivity  this approval came in the form of a tentative approval  We will now submit the  Request for Final Approval  letter to the FDA based on which we expect to receive Final Approval and then launch our product  as anticipated  in the third quarter of 2013   The chart above seems to indicate to me that 2 strong moves are possible  either up or down  While the accumulation looks good  the money flow index is pointing downwards  which in my experience indicates to me that shorts are getting into position  anticipating a  sell on news  However  because of the strong accumulation indicator  the shorts might also be over estimating the sell on news  and could get squeezed  Therefore  my long trade price target is  7  with a short cover price target of  6  Because Supernus had to wait a year until exclusivity of Topamax ended  I feel investors have let this company fall of the radar  If Supernus can successfully launch its product later this year  I believe there will finally be a reversal in the downtrend that started in late 2012  which could make for nice longer term appreciation  Disclosure  I am long GTXI  Disclaimer  This article is intended for informational and
