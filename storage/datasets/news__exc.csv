199953,421469,EXC,U S  FERC set to approve construction of four LNG export projects in Texas,news," Reuters    The U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  is scheduled on Thursday to vote on four proposed liquefied natural gas  LNG  export facilities in Texas totaling about 6 2 billion cubic feet per day  bcfd  of capacity 
The projects are NextDecade Corp s  O NEXT  3 6 bcfd Rio Grande  Cheniere Energy Inc s  A LNG  1 5 bcfd Corpus Christi Midscale  Exelon Corp s  O EXC  0 8 bcfd Annova LNG Brownsville and Texas LNG s 0 3 bcfd Brownsville 
One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U S  homes for a day 
Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington  D C  said in a note that the majority Republican commission is likely to approve all four facilities with a likely holdout from Democratic Commissioner Richard Glick in line with the recent trend 
The three Brownsville proposals  Rio Grande is a Brownsville plant  are to build greenfield projects along the Brownsville Ship Channel to receive gas from the nearby Permian and Eagle Ford shale basins and have faced concerns from environment and safety advocates 
To gain approval  the Brownsville projects have taken steps like pledging land for the preservation of endangered big cats   jaguarundis and ocelots   that live in the South Texas area 
In July  FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee created a new division of LNG Facility Review   Inspection to address the rising volume and complexity of LNG projects for approval  Height Capital said 
Last week  FERC issued the final environmental review for Pembina Pipeline Corp s  TO PPL  1 0 bcfd Jordan Cove LNG export project in Oregon 
The projects FERC is expected to approve on Thursday are just four of more than four dozen LNG export projects under development in the United States  Canada and Mexico 
Just looking at the projects under construction  U S  LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 6 9 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 9 6 bcfd by the end of 2020 from 6 8 bcfd now 
That keeps the United States on track to become the third biggest LNG exporter in the world in 2019  behind Qatar and Australia  and the biggest supplier of the fuel in 2024 
This week  the Senate energy committee approved the nomination of Republican James Danly to the five person commission  sending it to the full Senate where Height Capital said he is expected to be approved for a term through June 30  2023 




The President still has not nominated a candidate for the remaining Democratic vacancy at FERC  Height Capital said ",2019-11-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-ferc-set-to-approve-construction-of-four-lng-export-projects-in-texas-2025374,2025374

Crane  Exelon s CEO Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dan  and good morning  everyone  Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter earnings call I m going to start on Slide 5  On almost all accounts  we had a very good 2019  Exelon Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities  ComEd had its best performance ever  the nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor and we delivered financially  As you can read  the full year GAAP earnings were  3 01 per share and the non GAAP earnings were  3 22 per share  above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range  Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call  I want to address the operational details as we go forward Last year  Exelon Utilities invested  5 5 billion in capital and  150 million  which is  150 million more than originally planned  These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience  improve reliability and resiliency  modernization of our gas system  resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities We had a productive year on the regulatory front  Pepco DC filed its first multi year rate case and Maryland s PSC is moving forward with a multi year rate plans  We ve received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE  PECO s transmission formula was approved by FERC and ComEd s formula rate provided the third rate decrease in five years  helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago Excuse me  on the policy front  the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs  New York State Supreme Court affirmed the ZEC program and the New Jersey    and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring  Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI  and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation  setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment FERC approved PJM s Fast Start reforms  PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules  We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5  annually through 2020  with the Board raising the annual dividend to  1 53 per share in January  We re good partners also with the communities we serve  Our employees volunteered a record breaking 251 000 hours in 2019  that s 11 000 more than in 2018  During National Volunteer Week  we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5 400 employees  which is another record In addition  Exelon donated nearly  52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint  We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33 000 employees  We are once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes  DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded  2 billion for the third straight year  accounting for 27  of our overall supplier spend  Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local based diverse businesses by offering development programs  We also continued to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row  We are focused on operating at world class levels  delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe  reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we ve had in 2019  We delivered on our commitments to you  our shareholders  but also our employees and our customers and our communities However  this year was not    last year was not without challenges  including subpoenas  we received from the US Attorney s office in Northern Illinois As we said before  we are limited in what we can share about the investigation  However  I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the US Attorney s Office and taking the situation very seriously  The Board appointed a Special Committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that  going forward  we operate at the highest possible standards  At the end of the  Technical Issues  our commitments for 2020 Turning to Slide 6  we re committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers  Since 2016  we have deployed nearly  22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest  26 billion over the next four years  These investments enhance reliability  resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems  We ve been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards    the bills affordable  The rates in all our major cities  Baltimore  Chicago  Philadelphia  Washington are 13  to 18  below the average of    for the large    largest US cities  and 2  to 7  below the national average  These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers  Customer satisfaction is at the highest level it s ever been at each one of our utilities  reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments Frequency of outages has decreased significantly  down near 50  at ComEd and 30  at PHI  Outage duration has also decreased by 52  and 38  at ComEd and BGE  respectively  2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE  On the gas side  PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30 000 metallic gas services in 2018  These investments will help our customers  current and future needs  while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse gas emissions Moving to Slide 7  Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and the gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs  more reliable and more resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change  We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments  Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools  including alternate rate making such as formula rates and multi year rate plans  as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs Turning to Slide 8  FERC s recent order on PJM capacity  The Governors in Illinois  Maryland and Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity to be supplied by a 100  clean  These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy and we share that goal  and we ll work with them to achieve it  Unfortunately  there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs  FERC s December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule or MOPR  will result in clean resources  supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market  only to be replaced by carbon based generation  This would result in billions of dollars of additional cost for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy  Our states  as well as many others oppose FERC s MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response  We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC s MOPR decision and enable the transition to a 100  clean On Slide 9  we show our operating performance for the year  Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations  All achieve first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate  And I mentioned  we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE  ComEd and PECO  achieving top decile and PHI s performance significantly improved in the last three years  missing first quartile by 0 01  Phonetic  points  Reliability performance was mix this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid Atlantic  For instance  PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019  compared to eight in 2018  Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations  However  ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration  and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration Turning to Generation on Slide 10  Our fleet    Generation fleet performed one of its best years ever  very good in 2019  providing a significant portion of the country s clean energy  Exelon generates 12  or one out of every nine clean megawatts in the United States  Our best in class nuclear fleet operated very well last year  Our capacity factor was 95 7   our highest ever  We generated 155 million megawatt hours  avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019  Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days  matching the record set in 2018 and 18    14 days better than the industry average Exelon powers  gas and hydro dispatch match 97 9   and wind and energy capture at 96 3  were better than plan  Our Constellation business remains the industry leader  A vast majority of our retail business is with C I customers  where we have the largest retail platform with 25  market share  delivering 154 terawatt hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor  Our retail operating metrics remain strong  79  customer renewal rates  average customer duration of more than six years and power contracts terms of 23 months on average  We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers  Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins Constellation s strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers  We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs  while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals  We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity And I will turn the call over to Joe to review the financials Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Chris  and good morning  everyone  Today I will cover our 2019 results  annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance Starting with Slide 11  we had another strong year  For the fourth quarter  we earned  0 79 per share on a GAAP basis and  0 83 per share on a non GAAP basis  For the full year  we earned  3 01 per share on a GAAP basis and  3 22 per share on a non GAAP basis  which is above our revised full guidance    full year guidance of  3 05 to  3 20 per share and  0 07 per share above our original midpoint Exelon Utilities delivered a combined  1 91 per share net of holding company expenses  Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance  due to favorable O M  including lack of major storm and favorable weather at PECO and BGE  as well as higher distribution revenues at BGE  These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd s ROE ExGen earned  1 31 per share  exceeding its guidance range of  1 20 to  1 30 per share  ExGen s outperformance was primarily due to favorable O M  including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development or R D tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years  We are expected to record this benefit  but it was more favorable than we had planned  This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem  Hamley station and a contracted asset during the year  Overall  we delivered well on our financial commitments Moving to Slide 12  The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9 2  ROE for the trailing 12 months  up 90 basis points from year end 2018  The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions  as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O M  partially offset by an increase in depreciation  Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10   slightly improving from year end 2018 Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis  we earned a 10  ROE for the trailing 12 months  which compares to last year s 9 6   As a reminder  we targeted 9  to 10  consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time  And we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities On Slide 13  we rolled forward our outlook for utility capex and rate base  covering 2020 to 2023  This year  we expect to invest nearly  6 5 billion in our utilities and a total of  26 billion over the next four years  These investments are improving our system reliability  service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future  Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects  As we move through time  we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period  we have identified nearly  4 9 billion in additional investment  including an additional  1 9 billion since last year s fourth quarter call  As Chris mentioned  these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence  overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities Since the PHI merger in 2016  Phonetic   we have added more than  9 billion in rate base across the utility  Over the next four years  we will grow our rate base 7 3  annually to  54 2 billion  adding  13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd  without paying a premium  issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals As a reminder  65  of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers  These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system  while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital  Where we do not have these mechanisms  we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools Chris touched on this earlier  but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments  while maintaining lower customer rates  compared to other large urban areas  When we look at our projected residential bills  we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments  In the appendix  we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on Slide 23 Turning to Slide 14  We continue to forecast strong utility less holding company EPS growth of 6  to 8   When you consider the drop in the 30 year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly a  0 05  compared to what we had showed you last year  we ve been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased capex program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers  which brings us to the durability of our industry leading earnings growth  which reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals  successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15  I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM is not yet held the capacity auction for the 2022 2023 delivery year  we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021 So turning to the table  There is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or  21 from our last disclosure  Open gross margin declined by  400 million and  100 million in  20 and  21  respectively  due to decline in power prices across most regions offset by our hedges  During the quarter  we executed  50 million of power new business in 2020 We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years  We ended the year 6  to 9  behind in 2020 and 3  to 6  behind in 2021 by taking cross commodity hedges into account  We continue to see some upside in certain markets  but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility Slide 16  shows our O M and capital outlook at Generation for 2020 and 2021  compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year  our O M is down in each year  The updated forecast reflects O M cuts we announced on last quarter call  pension benefits and nuclear savings  The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns  but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate  Taking both into account our pension expense  it s about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately  25 million in 2021 Turning to capex  we expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year  We ve reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021  given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities  given their growing capital needs  Nuclear fuel costs are also lower into 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year s disclosure  primarily due to a shift in deliveries  Overall  we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon  We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen  while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet Moving to Slide 17  We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating  Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consistent with our targeted ranges and above S P thresholds  Looking at ExGen  we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target for 3 0 times  For 2020  we expect to be at 2 4 times debt to EBITDA and 1 9 times debt to EBITDA  when excluding non recourse debt  This year  we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth  At ExGen  we plan to retire  1 5 billion of long term debt this year  including the  1 billion maturity we paid off in January  As a reminder  this is in addition to the  600 million of long term debt retired in October of 2019 Finally  I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18  We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of  3 to  3 30 per share  Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base  as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers  as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases  We will see offset from lower treasuries on ComEd s earned ROEs  higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases  most notably at PECO  Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities less Holdco is  1 80 a share to  2 10 per share The decline in our ExGen s earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues  more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains  These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York  We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of  0 85 per share to  0 95 per share  More detail on the year over year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix  starting on Slide 55 With that  I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Joe  Turning to Slide 19  I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020  We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses  focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities  while staying focused on safety and reliability  We will meet or exceed our financial commitments  delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment grade credit ratings as Joe mentioned At utilities  we will prudently and effectively deploy  6 5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs our state s energy policy goals  And we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments  We will support the enacted    enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives  which was in flight in several states  We will    and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve  this is key to who we are Slide 20  I will close on Exelon s value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders  We will continue our focus on growing our utilities  targeting 7 3  rate base growth and 6  to 8  earnings growth through 2023  rolling forward another year  this    at this above group trajectory  we will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth  pay down debt and support the external dividend We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generating fleet  closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there  while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation  We will sustain growth investment grade metrics    excuse me  strong investment grade metrics and we will grow our dividend at 5  through 2020  The strategy underpinning this value proposition is our effective and providing tangible benefits to our shareholders  We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon Operator  we can now open the call to questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first response is from Greg Gordon with Evercore Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Congratulations on a great year and the outlook is encouraging  A couple questions  the utility growth outlook is obviously improved as we go out through time  despite the headwind from ComEd  The capex is up significantly  but the rate base growth numbers look like they re not moving as much in tandem  I skimmed through the whole deck  I understand you ve also moved capital around the different jurisdictions as well  But can you just comment on sort of that modest level of dissidence between capex being up and rate base growth looking like it s not up as much Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Greg  Good morning  it s Joe  Yes  the issue isn t solely that the incremental capex that we mentioned of approximately  2 billion isn t falling the rate base  It s about all of the capex and what we get into is the timing of when these projects go in service  So  we ve updated some assumptions as it relates to the schedule of when the projects are finished  and then they go into service  In addition to that  we could have changes and things like depreciation that would also impact that  So it s really just a movement of when we see project timing and other things Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystSo AFUDC is not or CWIP and AFUDC are not contemplated in that    those calculations then Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  they re not contemplated in that calculation Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  That explains it  Thanks  In terms of the cash flow profile  I know that you haven t given us an update  But    because we do have obviously significant uncertainty with regard to ExGen and Illinois  But as you look at most scenarios there  whether it s getting some sort of deserved incremental revenue for the clean attribute to your plants or having to use self help to rectify the earnings issues  Under most of those scenarios  do you still see the utility being funded by the cash flow of the corporation without needing equity through this forecast period Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Greg  So first thing  I would say is based on the current plan  as I mentioned in my prepared remarks  we don t incorporate any equity issuance from in the plan  And going forward  we can meet the funding needs and maintain the investment grade credit metrics under most scenarios that we look at  because we do look at this under a range of different possibilities Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Two more questions  They are quick  One  since the Q  since the EI deck where you usually give us your update on where you think O M and capital are driving at ExGen  things have improved on the margin  Can you comment on how you ve pulled forward some of those  the O M and capex trajectory Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I think the big thing is when you look at the improvement in ExGen earnings  it s really driven by four variables  As you could see in  20 and  21  the gross margin hasn t changed  right  But what has changed is  we announced the O M reductions on the third quarter call  that s been a benefit  Property    lower property taxes has been a benefit at ExGen  Lower depreciation is also a benefit  And then finally  we do have some lower interest expense when you think about the retirement of debt  So  those four variables have driven improvement to the ExGen earnings Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Final question  Chris  Time flies  seems like yesterday since you made the commitment to grow the dividend 5  through 2020 and here we are in 2020  And you ve made good on that commitment  At what point do you go back to the Board with a recommendation on the dividend policy post 2020 Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  I would anticipate the discussions with the Board will be in the fall timeframe  when we have further clarity on what the future looks like  if we are able to enact some of the policies and programs in the states we re working on  And it provides us with certainty that we can provide certainty to the Board that maintaining the health of the balance sheet  while creating shareholder value  We should have a better picture at that time  So  I would expect us talking to you around year end timeframe about that Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you  Chris  Take care  guys Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThank you  Your next response is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley Stephen Byrd    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  Good morning Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Stephen Byrd    Morgan Stanley    AnalystI had a couple of broader policy questions  We ve certainly been seeing quite a bit of evidence of  especially in the PJM states  a movement away from fossil fuels  And on the merchant side  I think  I understand some of the moving parts there  But on the regulated utility side  what is your sense of the degree to which states are now pushing to move away from fossil fuels  And how do you think broadly about pivoting and sort of reacting to that shift at the utility side of your business Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo  as you know  Steven  our utilities do not have any generation and are restricted from having generation in the states that we serve  What you see in our planning years that you re looking at for the utilities  they incorporate what we believe needs to be done to support the state s needs  which calls for more robust distribution system investments to allow two way energy flows  which is going to require transmission build out to take care of importing the win from the pockets of the service areas that we serve  And that s what s anticipated right now in the capital plan that we have in front of you  We have got to keep up with the state s policies  legislative agendas or whatever is going to change the system  so our customers can benefit from these policies that the states are enacting Stephen Byrd    Morgan Stanley    AnalystUnderstood  And then just shifting over to the PJM capacity process  I wanted to just get your latest thinking on next steps procedurally  I m thinking about sort of the broader process under which PJM would refine their approach and the timing under which they have an auction  And I guess  I m thinking also about the possibility of pretty significant litigation around the    whatever comes out of the PJM and the FERC process here  How do you see that unfolding  Just wanted to get your latest thoughts there Kathleen L  Barron    Senior Vice President  Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public PolicyHi  Steven  It s Kathleen Barron  I can take that question  I ll start with auction timing  As you know  there is a large group of stakeholders  including clean energy advocates  consumer advocates  renewable developers and most importantly  the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction  There s just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills  So we  of course  agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they re developing their next filing at FERC  which as you know is in March  to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the state s needs And in terms of litigation  you re right that there have been a number of request for rehearing that have been filed  that would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation forecast  No timeline on which to act on request for rehearing  but I think the more important point is  they have been developing this policy for years  I mean  they ve laid out in an order in ISO New England  three years ago that MOPR is their standard solution and they ve carried that through to PJM  I see no future where they change their mind on that policy  And I think  therefore  the states are right in looking at what their alternatives are to continue participation in RPM Stephen Byrd    Morgan Stanley    AnalystUnderstood  And just to follow up there  Kathleen  Can the auction proceed if there is pretty significant litigation for multiple states  sort of questioning the fundamentals of that FERC order Kathleen L  Barron    Senior Vice President  Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public PolicyWell  technically  it can  I mean  I think  from a good governance perspective  of course  as I said before  PJM should take into account the fact that some of the state s needs more information to figure out what the impact is going to be on their citizens  They are going to need to do an internal evaluation  But from a legal perspective  the FERC order is final and once the compliance filing is submitted and approved  then PJM will be allowed to conduct an auction unless there is some sort of a judicial stay imposed Stephen Byrd    Morgan Stanley    AnalystUnderstood  That s helpful  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  Your next response is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystYes  Hi  good morning Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystCan you hear me  OK  Chris  Thanks Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Perfect  Yes  we   Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  great  So just on the Illinois process  could you just maybe talk to  I guess  an update of the legislation and just trying to make sure that  I think the hope is that there ll be more of a long term framework in place for treatment of nuclear and renewables  And just how much is that likely to be part of any legislative activity in the state Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  it s definitely    there is two focuses that Exelon has in the legislation  One is the ComEd side  ensuring that we have adequate recovery mechanisms for capital investments being made  while trying to maintain the customer protections that we need by caps on bill increases  so that part is very critical  Kathleen can address the Genco part  She has been heading that up in Springfield  in and around the state Kathleen L  Barron    Senior Vice President  Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public PolicySure  Steve  I can jump in on the    on your point about having a longer term framework  which is exactly the point of the legislation that s pending in Illinois  And the idea of using the fixed resource requirement provision in the PJM tariff for the FRR provision is to give states that kind of flexibility to provide  for example  for renewables that may want to have contracts of different lengths  exactly that flexibility for them to have those those contracts  And likewise  for their broader clean energy goals for them to be able to differentiate when they re procuring capacity resources between clean resources and emitting resources and having that ability to design their capacity procurement to meet their state policy on a longer term basis is one of the key benefits of the FRR strategy Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  And any sense on when we ll get kind of a more  kind of  fully    full bill with more details proposed to get a better sense on just the details of the potential bill Kathleen L  Barron    Senior Vice President  Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public PolicyYes  I think you should expect to see further discussion and public hearings about what the bill should look like  As you know  there are a number of proposals that are alive in the legislature and Springfield  And so there needs to be some discussion and public hearings of how the state s policy on all the issues that are pending will come together in a comprehensive approach  So  I think over the course of the spring session  those details will become more evident  As you know in most legislators  it usually takes until closer to the end of the session for all the details to be worked out  but I think you ll start to see over the coming weeks and months more details emerge Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  And then a broader question just on  I guess  it s a ESG nuclear carbon question  Just maybe for Chris  Just how do you feel about your ability to get credit  It seems like there s a lot of focus on ESG and renewables and not necessarily as much focus on the benefits of nuclear and carbon reduction  As you said  12  of the megawatt hours you produced for the country last year  Just how do you feel that you re going to be able to get credit either Republican or Democrat for the benefits of nuclear  Just how both sides are kind of looking at that right now  Including on the Democrat side Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think over the last two years to three years  you ve seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it s contributing to a cleaner environment  low carbon and also other emitting gases  So as we work with stakeholders explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable like base load nuclear and there has been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that  The dialog is going on  on how do we keep these assets  so the states can make their goals and that s going to be a critical part going forward We ve shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state  we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables and we re just going to go backwards with our carbon emission  So  we have to do our job not only as a company  but as an industry and we re trying to do that  The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that through greater and broader masses and we ll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states  We ve seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York  We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois  We re going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants and that s where we re talking about FRR And it s also another part of it  it s more than just environmental  The reliability they provide  the jobs they provide  the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful  And to not have these assets or to be replaced with carbon based assets will just send the states  not only financially but environmentally backwards Steve Fleishman    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you OperatorThanks you  Your next response is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystHey  Good morning  guys Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystJust focusing little bit on the Genco  If we get to sort of the November veto session and find energy legislation gets pushed to  21  and we assume that there will be a PJM auction in let s say  December and January and another one roughly six months after that  Can you just walk us through how you would be thinking about the auction participation and the timing of potential closures  And do you feel that the MOPR order has catalyzed the states to act on CJC Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  we re not speculating right now on that  We surely hope for many complicated issues that the states are able to enact and given time to enact the policies that they desire  that will allow these plants to still operate  I ve said for the last four years or five years on almost every earnings call that if we can t see a path to financial stability for each one of these assets  then we will have to retire them  And we are not going to speculate today on which ones are win  but we ve shut down Oyster Creek  gone into decommissioning with the decommissioning company  TMI is off  There was no path for financial stability And as I ve said in the past  we must watch the balance sheet and our debt commitments and negative cash flow assets will only send the fleet backwards and our goals on strong investment grade  that will allow us to maintain our commitments to operate plants safely and meet our financial commitments on retiring our debt  So  we ll work hard through this legislative session to convey the importance of it and we re not going to speculate until we no longer have a path to profitability for the assets Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystGot it  And then  if    let s just say  Illinois does FRR  how are you thinking about maybe the potential impacts on sort of the rest of the RTO fleet like in Pennsylvania and Maryland  especially given  obviously  the IMM has been taken somewhat of a bearish tone on the impact Kathleen L  Barron    Senior Vice President  Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public PolicyYes  Shar  this is Kathleen  I can take that one  I mean  there are a number of estimates as you know out there about the impact of one  two  three  four  five states choosing the FRR option  We have not conducted an analyses of what that means for the rest of the pool  So  I m not going to speculate on which ones of those analyses are accurate But I will just say with respect to the market monitor and the suggestion that the MOPR is going to have no impact on capacity clearing prices  it s    and I know that  that s been repeated by number of the fossil companies  it s a little bit concerning  I mean it s exactly these state programs that they    that were the reason that the MOPR litigation was brought by these companies  Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York when New York adopted a ZEC program  they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by  15 billion over the course of that program s life  The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices  Commissioner Glick estimated that it s going to raise capacity prices by  2 4 billion annually across the pool  Other independent analyses have gone there  too  So  it s just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is going to have no impact Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  And congrats  guys  It s very solid results Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next response is from Joseph Rokowski from Bank of America  Please go ahead Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  It s Julien  Can you hear me Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  Thank you guys for the time  Super quick  Let me come back to some of the numbers that we start with Greg earlier  Just in terms of the guidance  I know you mentioned the AFUDC spend and the reconciliation between capex and rate base  Can we talk about  the earnings  Obviously  rate base unchanged  EPS guidance higher  Is that principally due to some of the changes in AFUDC that isn t formerly reflecting that rate base  but obviously reflected in that capex  Or are there other changes  obviously  the cadence of the trajectory of the earnings in  20 and  21 onwards has shifted a little bit as well  So  I just wanted to clarify that And then also on ExGen  similar dynamic around what s causing the offset versus the open margin  I think you had a little bit of a quick brief commentary about basis potentially  So just want to elaborate quickly on that as well as maybe the tax piece for ExGen year over year Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Julien  Good morning  it s Joe  On your first question  remember we re giving you guidance for the combined EU and Holdco  So  there is a couple of variables  even though we re investing capex and rate bases and rising  When you look at it  the interest rate    the interest expense at corporate is projected lower  which drive EPS as one variable that s positive to the earnings  We are    when you look at these projects  right  You could still see there is additional capex growth and then we ve had some improvement in ROEs versus our prior plan  as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance  So  there is a number of variables outside just the incremental capex that would drive the value Your second question on the offsets at Generation  It s    when you look at the prices falling  use 21 as an example where we re less than 70  hedged  You see that you would have the open gross margin come down  However  that s a price at a common trading point when you look at the values associated back to where the generator bus bars are  for example  those prices move every day as well  And there was some offsets associated with that  so that got us down to flat Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Excellent  And then just to come back to the broader strategic points here  At what point in time you need to make decisions here  It sounds like there s a latitude through the course of this year  And then related to that  are you expecting any kind of FRR developments ahead of these auctions themselves  Or would    the outcome of the auction and the outcome of any ultimate resolution of how to run this auction proved to be a decision point for states outside of Illinois  I just want to understand the cadence of events  given where we stand today  I know there s a lot of moving pieces  And that could be a long question  But I ll let you respond to as you keep that Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe are definitely responding to the MOPR in our commentary to FERC and PJM if they need to allow the states to enact whatever policy or legislation they are pursuing prior to running the auctions  There is adequate capacity in within the system that we don t need to rush  to secure it until the rules are clear  So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states  we are able to take action  which means you d be looking at 2024  2025 before you d be able to enact  And that s a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point So  we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics  If the bill  as we ve seen it and draft toward the end of last year is enacted  it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer  It s not a bill increase as being communicated by some or understood by others  It actually  as Kathleen pointed out  could cost as much as  2 6 billion to the PJM customers and you take just Illinois alone  that s about 15  or a little over  400 million on an annual basis  on an increase to those customers So  there is a customer benefit here  There is    as drafted or inputted previously  there is a cap on the    and what can be increased on both sides  the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in a system  So  we need to be able to have the time or the states need to be able to have the time and there is discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently and we hope that PJM respects the state s needs and allows them time to enact the policies that they desire Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Your last question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  Joe and Chris Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Mike Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  Maybe you could explain a little bit why the hedging program is still  I guess  a little bit more behind ratable  I guess you talked about not expecting a significant balance in power prices going forward  Just wondering what the thinking is Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I ll let Jim McHugh answer that James McHugh    Chief Executive Officer  Constellation Executive Vice PresidentYes  Hi  Michael  it s Jim  We have shifted our positioning in the markets through time  I think we    at this time  a year or 18 months ago or even 24 months ago  we are carrying a position behind ratable  primarily in the baseload regions  looking at the markets and where they were trading  What we ve done is we ve shifted some of that to different regions  For example  one of the areas we ve    with a backward dated curve in ERCOT  for example  we see opportunities in different seasons in Texas  with ORDC pricing being more relative for the future  So  there is just    we re picking and choosing our spots  I would say  and it s spread out across multiple regions and it s just a smaller overall position  but we re looking at where the opportunities are And then  not a little bit relative to your question  I would just highlight to that the vast majority of our new business would not come from that type of optimization activity  but 70  to 75  will come from our load sales and customer facing business in retail and wholesale  So  we see a good strong pipeline for those activities and you saw the win rates and renewal rates that Chris spoke to during the call  which is another opportunity for us to continue to make our new business targets Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystAll right  Still pretty well balanced  And on the capital program  would it be fair to say that it s    that you are being conservative on it  given the uncertainty over PJM and CJC  Could the capital program actually be higher next year  if we see some more resolution or more certainty over there Joseph Nigro    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMichael  what I would say is our capital program reflects what we think is the projects we ve identified  as I said in my prepared remarks at this point in time  I think that you ve seen the uptick in what we put in 2019 versus what we re putting in 2020  and we ll continue to challenge ourselves for the benefit of our customers  But right now  I would tell you  I think what we re showing you is a fair reflection of where we are and what we expect to do Calvin G  Butler    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon UtilitiesAnd Michael  this is Calvin  I would also say  when you look at 2019  we added  150 million additional capital all around gas  main replacement and really adding to the overall customer experience  And as we ve built out our plan  whether it s transmission or distribution  additional capital  it s all around meeting those customers  expectations and our stakeholders in terms of reliability and resiliency  So  we feel we have a solid plan and can execute to it Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerThe only thing I d add to that is  every quarter we look at the total bill of the customers and we re very sensitive to making sure the investment is prudent  It drives efficiency  reliability and benefit to the customer and we also watch the affordability Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  One last question  Hey  Calvin  for the PHI multi year rate plan filing for this year  are you guys    would it be fair to say that the ROEs tick up from the low 9s  could go up to the high 9s  if you get that approved later on Calvin G  Butler    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon UtilitiesNo  what we anticipate  we do not    first  right now  we expect the DC commission to come out with a ruling in the fourth quarter of this year  And along the way  we ve adjusted our ask in terms of those multi year plans  but we have a very solid understanding of what those ROEs are  So  I m comfortable with where they are right now Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  All right  Thank you very much Chris M  Crane    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  And thank you for participating today  Before we end  I want to thank our employees for staying focused on safety and delivering another good year  both operationally and financially  And with that  I ll close out the

199959,421475,EXC,Exelon  EXC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Exelon  EXC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 11  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 9  
Revenues are expected to be  9 23 billion  up 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 01  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon 
For Exelon  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of  0 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 92  delivering a surprise of  4 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Exelon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelon-exc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200504503,200504503

199987,421503,EXC,Exelon  EXC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Exelon  EXC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  9 35 billion  down 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 22  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon 
For Exelon  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 56  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 60  delivering a surprise of  4 76  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Exelon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelon-exc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200477601,200477601

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  4 76   A quarter ago  it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of  0 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 87  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates 
Exelon  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  7 69 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 60   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 08 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Exelon shares have lost about 0 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for Exelon 
While Exelon has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

200016,421532,EXC,Earnings Preview  Exelon  EXC  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Exelon  EXC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 3  
Revenues are expected to be  7 89 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 68  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon 
For Exelon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of  0 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 87  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Exelon doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-exelon-exc-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200445067,200445067

200026,421542,EXC,This Is Why Exelon  EXC  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Exelon in Focus
Based in Chicago  Exelon  EXC  is in the Utilities sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 9 09   The energy company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 36 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 95   This compares to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 92  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 45 is up 5 1  from last year  In the past five year period  Exelon has increased its dividend 3 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 12   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Exelon s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  EXC expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 13 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 0 32  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  EXC is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-exelon-exc-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200407628,200407628

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon 
For Exelon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 46  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Exelon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of  0 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 58  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Exelon appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelon-exc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200410241,200410241

In April 2014  the court upheld a regulation limiting air pollution across state lines  In June 2014  the court largely upheld the government s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from major utilities  Industry groups and states are gearing up to challenge EPA s plans to issue new regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions from existing power plants  The three consolidated cases are Michigan v  EPA  14 46  Utility Air Regulatory Group v  EPA  14 47  National Mining Association v  EPA  14 49 ",2015-06-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-top-court-invalidates-obama-administration-mercury-air-pollution-rule-348716,348716

200052,421568,EXC,Exelon  EXC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Exelon  EXC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 8  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 5  
Revenues are expected to be  7 22 billion  down 13 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 46  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon 
For Exelon  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 10  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Exelon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of  0 88 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Exelon appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exelon-exc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200382692,200382692

200064,421580,EXC,EXC Vs  IDA  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Utility   Electric Power sector might want to consider either Exelon  EXC  or IdaCorp  IDA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  both Exelon and IdaCorp are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
EXC currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 03  while IDA has a forward P E of 22 72  We also note that EXC has a PEG ratio of 3 28  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  IDA currently has a PEG ratio of 8 17 
Another notable valuation metric for EXC is its P B ratio of 1 36  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  IDA has a P B of 2 15 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EXC s Value grade of B and IDA s Value grade of C 
Both EXC and IDA are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that EXC is the superior value option right now ",2018-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/exc-vs-ida-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200367785,200367785

Of these  value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now 
One company value investors might notice is Exelon  EXC   EXC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A 
Investors should also recognize that EXC has a P B ratio of 1 36  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 1 75  EXC s P B has been as high as 1 36 and as low as 1 08  with a median of 1 23  over the past year 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  EXC has a P S ratio of 1 28  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 86 
Finally  our model also underscores that EXC has a P CF ratio of 4 42  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  EXC s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 6 88  Within the past 12 months  EXC s P CF has been as high as 5 07 and as low as 3 56  with a median of 4 13

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Exelon in Focus
Exelon  EXC  is headquartered in Chicago  and is in the Utilities sector  The stock has seen a price change of 12 61  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 34 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 11   In comparison  the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield is 3 22   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 38 is up 5 3  from last year  In the past five year period  Exelon has increased its dividend 3 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 2 40   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Exelon s current payout ratio is 45   meaning it paid out 45  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
EXC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  3 12 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 20  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  EXC presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-exelon-exc-could-be-a-great-choice-200352291,200352291

looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Exelon Corporation   NYSE EXC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Exelon Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Exelon s current PE ratio tad above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having trended upwards  over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Exelon has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Exelon has a P S ratio of about 1 1  which is lower than its industry s average of 7 5 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Exelon currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Exelon a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio of Exelon  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 2  which is lower than the industry average of 8 6  Clearly  EXC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Exelon might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives EXC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward and three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped 3 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Exelon Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat dismal trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineExelon is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 27   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  its industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for

200117,421633,EXC,Big Oil Champions New Carbon Capture And Storage Technologies,opinion,"For an industry that has for decades been criticized by environmental groups as the root of all evil it is ironic that oil and gas producers are aligned in championing carbon capture with such enthusiasm 
The fossil fuel industry is at the forefront of lobbying for radical changes in public policy into research to cut the costs of extracting CO2 from hydrocarbon energy  Industry leaders like Bob Dudley from BP are  in the Telegraph as saying   we can t just keep our heads in the sand  
The reality is the hydrocarbon industry has seen the writing on the wall  Public attitudes are hardening  aided by worries about particulate emissions from diesel cars and air pollution in major cities from Beijing to Delhi and even in western capitals like London  The industry is under huge pressure from sovereign wealth funds  pension funds and activist shareholders to find long term solutions to the carbon question and thwart claims that hydrocarbons are our sunset energy source 
Gradually hardening tax regimes  which give politicians the opportunity to raise revenue with carbon taxes  are also applying pressure to the hydrocarbon Industry to come up with viable ways to reduce a carbon footprint  Hence their enthusiasm for carbon capture and storage  CCS  
Carbon Capture
The article explains Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  is involved in a quarter of all CCS projects worldwide from simple CO2 storage to developing new chemicals that can lower emissions  and controversially backs a carbon tax  The company is in a joint venture with fuel cell energy to develop carbonate fuel cells that can capture 90  of CO2 gases cheaply  It s this kind of technology that will make the difference  So far  traditional CO2 capture and sequestration projects  frequently run over budget and fail to deliver carbon capture at anything like an economic rate 
The article describes an interesting project on the Texas Gulf Coast  built by a firm called  and supported by Toshiba  T 6502  and Exelon  NYSE EXC   The technology is said to produce electricity from natural gas that is cost competitive with current technologies and generates zero atmospheric emissions   eliminating the smokestack altogether 

Source  NetPower
According to NetPower  the technology employs a process called oxy combustion  where fuel is burned with pure oxygen instead of ambient air  Oxygen is preferable to air because air is nearly 80  nitrogen  When combusted  nitrogen creates NOx  a harmful pollutant 
Less NOx
Oxy combustion enables the plant to virtually eliminate all NOx production  In addition  it uses a mostly pure  high pressure stream of CO2 rather than in a traditional power station that uses steam to drive the turbine as its primary means of producing power  it has turned a major problem for other power systems   the energy and processes needed to capture  clean up  and compress carbon dioxide emissions   into a solution 
If it can be proved commercially sound  such technology could transform both the economics and environmental case for using natural gas for power production  Not surprisingly NetPower is getting a lot of interest from around the world in its project 
Clearly  the hydrocarbon industry was never going to roll over and die in the face of environmental pressures  but rather than fight a rear guard action  it is pouring funds into research and trialing new technologies that may not just ensure the economic future of their in ground resources  but dramatically improve the environmental landscape at the same time  Environmental pariah to environmental savior  now there s a slick move ",2017-03-21,MetalMiner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-oil-champions-new-carbon-capture-and-storage-technologies-200179612,200179612

200153,421669,EXC,Oil And Natural Gas Undergo Fundamental Shift,opinion,"Fundamental Shift
There are more signs that the fundamentals are changing for oil and natural gas  Not only has Saudi Arabia raised prices for their oil in a sign that they have confidence they can maintain market share  but natural gas had its best move all year last week  On top of that  a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico could shut down or slow operations which could impact imports  exports of oil and gas production  The mood has shifted so much that both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said that  60 00 a barrel is coming soon 
Saudi Arabia must feel confident that they have won the oil production war as they raised prices on most oil grades for sale to Asia and the U S  for July after the nation s energy minister said demand was robust  State owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co  increased its official selling price for Arab light crude by 35 cents a barrel to 60 cents more than the regional benchmark for sales to Asia  it said in an e mailed statement according to Bloomberg News  The company  known as Saudi Aramco  was expected to raise the premium for shipments of Arab light crude by 40 cents a barrel to 65 cents a barrel more than the benchmark for buyers in Asia  according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five refiners and traders in the region last week 
Andrew Weissman of EBW Analytics says that the oil market does not yet appear to be fully pricing in the likelihood of a sharp decline in Canadian imports in June  Due to the four to five week pipeline transit time between Fort McMurray and Cushing  the full impact of Canadian shutdowns  which began May 3rd  is not likely to be felt until this week s EIA Report  Once it begins U S  crude inventories could drop sharply for several weeks  pushing prices higher 
Of course some showed some worry after Baker Hughes reported a big jump in oil rigs last week  Fears that U S  shale producers would thwart the rally after increasing rigs for only the second time this year may be a concern to bulls  Yet what might be more disturbing is they also reported a sharp drop in natural gas rigs  Rigs targeting crude in the U S  rose by 9 to 325  but natural gas rigs fell by 5 to 82 which is near an all  time low 
Natural gas production could soon start to fall dramatically as some natural gas rigs get reclassified as oil rigs because oil is fetching a better price  Of course this summer that could cause big problems especially if we have a hot summer or if this active tropical storm season reduces production at a time when natural gas consumption is soaring to a record high 
The International Energy Agency says that consumption of natural gas for power generation  after hitting a record in 2015  is already exceeding 2015 levels by an astonishing 8 6   or 2 0 Bcf per day  Bcf d   They also say that this trend will continue and you can see why  The forced retirement of coal plants  the relative expense of nuclear power  is going to drain more gas than ever at a time when it seems that production might crater  In Illinois  Chicago based Exelon Corp  NYSE EXC    the largest U S  generator of power from nuclear energy  said it will close two Illinois reactors after the state failed to pass legislation to cut their financial losses 
The Energy Information Ageny forecasts that for the year  natural gas generation as a share of total generation  will exceed coal for the first time on record  Much of the growth in power burn is coming from the Southeast  the largest consuming region in the United States  The Southeast showed a 10 4  increase in power burn from May  2015 to May  2016  With less coal backup and the loss of more nuclear plants  we could see sharp weather driving spikes 
We are having a weather issue in the Gulf of Mexico  Tropical Storm Colin has strengthened in the Gulf of Mexico and will bring the threat of heavy rain to parts of Florida and the Southeast Monday and Tuesday  This system was first named Tropical Depression Three late Sunday morning and strengthened into a tropical storm late Sunday afternoon according to the Weather Channel  Colin has become the record earliest third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season  This early activity may mean we are in for a long summer of activity as the breakdown of El Nino and the settling in of La Nina may cause a hotter than normal summer and more tropical storm activity  both of which means upward price spikes in natural gas and oil are possible 
We are looking for a 3 million barrel drop in crude supply this week  We should also see Cushing  Oklahoma fall by 700 000 barrels  Gasoline supply should fall by 2 million barrels and distillates by 2 5 million barrels  For natural gas we should see an injection of 83 billion cubic feet ",2016-06-06,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-06-06-16-200134166,200134166

Some of our favorite uranium miners are flying such as Uranerz  AMEX URZ  up 15   Pele Mountain  TO GEM  up 14   U3O8 Corp  TO UWE  up 33 3  and Laramide  TO LAM  up 20  and Fission  TO FCU  up 12    It seems as if all the institutions are jumping in after the recent capitulation of some major funds in Toronto 

Uranerz is leading the sector powering through the 50 day moving average on huge volume  The uranium mining ETF  URA   UR Energy  AMEX URG   Kivalliq  TO KIV  and Laramide  OTC LMRXF  all appear to be on the verge of breaking out  The institutions are piling in but have overlooked some smaller cap stories  so there may be some opportunity there for a trade particularly in Anfield  TO ARY  and Pele Mountain  TO GEM    Volume is huge across the board 
The Republicans had a huge victory taking control of Congress and this could give a boost to nuclear power  The Democrats blocked funding for Yucca Mountain  a nuclear waste site  Now the Republicans can push forward a pro nuclear agenda 
This is a huge boom for nuclear utilities such as Exelon  NYSE EXC  which is making a new 52 week high breakout today  The chart looks excellent   Exelon has an uranium sales contract with one of favorite featured uranium miners Uranerz Energy outperforming the uranium equities on my watchlist above   URZ could be making a double bottom here 
Uranerz just announced that they are making progress on permitting the additional Jane Dough Area south of Nichols Ranch   Paul Goranson  President and Chief Operating Officer of Uranerz stated   Now that the Nichols Ranch facility is fully operational  we see the Jane Dough unit as being the next project to be developed  Given that this application is being filed as an amendment to the existing Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project license  we expect to see considerable time savings in both the WDEQ and the NRC review and approval process  

Uranerz began in situ mining operations on April 15  2014 in the Powder River Basin  Wyoming  The management team are well known former Cameco  NYSE CCJ  guys and work together with them on the processing  Cameco is the largest publicly traded uranium miner

200193,421709,EXC,Summer Shopping Opportunities For Mining Equities Abound  Rick Mills,opinion,Equity valuations have so far failed to keep pace with rising bullion prices  but that makes for some outstanding investor opportunities among a few particularly well positioned juniors that Rick Mills identifies as running ahead of the herd this summer  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Mills  publisher of Ahead of the Herd newsletter  points to continued low interest rates and increasing inflation as reasons that precious metals prices will keep climbing  And if discussions about elevating gold to Tier 1 asset status come to fruition  hold onto your hat  because that could shift the rate of ascent from steady to meteoric in a New York minute  The Gold Report  Prices of the mining equities were languishing when we spoke in January  particularly precious metals equities  and we ve had little respite since then  But you foresee potential for a bullish resurgence in gold equities  What s your rationale behind that outlook  Rick Mills  I believe we re going to see higher levels of inflation  We re going through a deflationary bout now because most of the money issued by the Federal Reserve is actually parked at the Fed  It isn t out there being spent  so it s not causing inflation  It s basically just propping up the banks  When the banks start lending and when the money gets into circulation  we ll see increased levels of inflation and  of course  that will be good for gold  TGR  Lack of access to capital for small business due to stringent credit requirements is one factor that has put a damper on the economy  What will prompt banks to ease up on credit standards  RM  I m probably going to stir up a little bit of controversy by saying so  but I firmly believe that the way out of the dilemma we re in is to spend more money  A lot of people don t agree  They think we should cut back on spending  raise taxes and go onto an austerity program  That is absolutely the wrong thing to do  Taxes should be reduced  I believe they should be spending a lot more money  TGR  Who should be spending more money  RM  World governments should implement massive global infrastructure maintenance and build out programs  and put the money not into the banks but into the small businesses that will build the infrastructure  These small businesses are the ones responsible for most of the job creation  So  give the money directly to the small businesses  Hire them to do this infrastructure build  Take a look at our global water supply problems  our highways  our bridges  the brownouts because our hydroelectric power corridors are so outdated  the switching stations literally melt when they overload  We can actually spend our way out of this  In a fiat currency regime  because nothing is anchored to gold  the only way to move forward is to keep spending money  We saw this when the U S  Quantitative Easing Two stopped and the lack of liquidity immediately upset the markets  If we undertake the infrastructure build out program and give the money to the small businesses that create jobs  as people get back to work  they ll have money  spend it and revive the economy  And it s not only the U S  every country in the world has an infrastructure deficit  TGR  What would more capital distribution among small business mean for the price of precious metals  RM  The moderate to high levels of inflation I anticipate will make gold a much more attractive asset  The banks will keep interest rates low to help stimulate business borrowing  and with low rates  typically below 2   you ve got higher rates of inflation than you are getting for interest  I wrote an article called     With high levels of real returns people don t favor gold as an investment  But when rates are below 2   the exact opposite happens  because the real rate of return is negative  For instance  if investors are getting 2  on bonds but the real rate of inflation is running at 3 3 5   they actually lose purchase power because the real rate of return is negative 1 1 5   So higher inflation just makes gold all that more attractive  It preserves purchasing power and  of course  the gold price is going up at the same time  TGR  As we speak today  gold is up  25 ounce  oz   flirting with  1 600 oz  Given that and the fact that gold is not only a store of value but also a hedge against inflation where do you predict the gold price will go during the rest of the summer and into the fall  RM  I honestly don t have a price prediction except that gold will go higher  When we talked last year  I was perfectly comfortable with  1 500 oz gold and thought that was a good price for it  Of course  it immediately spiked up to  1 900 oz but has come back to my range  I m still perfectly happy with  1 500 oz gold  As more people catch on to the fact that they need to own some gold  the price will slowly rise  TGR  Some people believe one of the reasons gold will go higher is because of the whispers we re hearing that the Bank for International Settlements  BIS  intends to reclassify gold as a risk free asset in the context of the Basel III framework  Could you help our readers understand why that would be bullish for gold  RM  Tier 1 capital is the core measure that regulators use to gauge a bank s financial strength  It typically consists mostly of common stock and disclosed reserves or retained earnings but it might also include non redeemable  non cumulative preferred stocks  The Basel Committee for Bank Supervision  known as the BCBS  which is the maker of the global capital requirements  also implemented the Basel III rules that form the basis for global bank regulation  The BCBS is studying making gold a bank capital Tier 1 asset  Gold has typically been a Tier 3 asset  which means that it s been discounted at 50  of its current market value  With that discount  banks really never had reason to hold gold as an asset  If the BCBS raises gold to the level of a Tier 1 capital asset  though  banks could operate with far less equity capital than is normally required and gold would be the ultimate backstop for debt  currencies and bank equity capital  It would be a huge move  and making it would really propel some superior interest in gold  TGR  Certain central banks  such as China s  are stockpiling gold already  If it becomes a zero risk weighted Tier 1 asset  countries all over the planet would start accumulating gold  which would of course drive up demand  What s the timeline on the BCBS decision  RM  We simply don t know  But if it happens  you re going to see substantial demand for physical bullion and it s going to be a hugely important step toward gold s re monetization  Moving from a Tier 3 to a Tier 1 asset would have gold compete directly as a safe haven investment against bonds issued by over indebted governments and yielding less than zero in inflation adjusted terms those negative real interest rates we discussed  Another factor to bear in mind  one that isn t widely recognized  is that there is a huge shortage of good collateral  banks are increasingly accepting gold as collateral because they re reluctant to take each other s fiat currencies  So there s another huge step toward the re monetization of gold  TGR  That would certainly suggest increasing value for the shares of companies searching for and producing gold  Some of them are producing gold very profitably at well under  1 500 oz  and a number of them  juniors in particular  have significant gold resources in the ground but in both cases  their share prices remain weak  In this scenario  what are you able to identify as big opportunities for investors over the next several years  RM  I can tell you about several juniors with some very exciting things happening this summer  They re interesting companies that everyone should have on their radar screens  TGR  Where shall we begin  RM  Starting alphabetically  Altair Ventures Inc  s  AVX TSX V  geologists and consultants  including Jim Oliver  former senior vice president  geology at Hunter Dickinson  have provided guidance on drill hole locations for the just started minimum 5 000 meter  m  drilling program  as the company chases resources on two zones on its Kena gold property in British Columbia  Total Measured and Indicated  M I  resources for the two zones comprise 549 000 contained ounces of gold  while total Inferred resources comprise 513 000 oz  Altair is going to twin some historical holes from these two zones  check results  make sure everything is good and then try and expand the existing  already sizeable  kernels of resources  Altair is looking to grow the two resource blocks and bring them together to form one large block  Altair is well run  President and CEO Fayyaz Alimohamed whom you ve interviewed in The Gold Report is very  very smart  Robert Archer  president and CEO of Cangold Limited  CLD TSX V  and Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TSX  GPL NYSE A   is on Altair s board so the technical advice he receives is second to none  The company has been holding its own  but this is one investors should be looking at because the drill program has started and the results off of this beautiful property could really propel Altair upward  TGR  Do you anticipate permitting being an issue with Altair  RM  No  I don t see any unusual problems cropping up  TGR  Okay  What else do you have in your quiver besides this micro cap gold explorer in B C   RM  NioGold Mining Corp   NOX TSX V  NOXGF OTCPK  will be releasing its updated NI 43 101 resource calculation in early August  It has done lots of drillings  released lots of assays and still has lots of news coming on its Marban and Malartic Block properties in Qu bec s Abitibi region  NioGold finished its second year program and  with  9 million  M  to spend  it s planning its third year  It will get very aggressive with the Norlartic Kierens  This thing is going to have a huge amount of news flow from its third year program  TGR  And it has a joint venture partner spending the money  RM  That s right  NioGold has  5M  but Aurizon Mines Ltd   ARZ TSX  AZK NYSE A  is spending the money  hitting on just about every hole drilled and growing the resource  I think the NI 43 101 that s due in August is going to surprise a lot of people  In fact  NioGold is one of the few companies that s having money spent on a project by another company and in this business  spending a lot of money means a lot of news flow  News is the lifeblood of a junior  If you want to move the share price  put out a lot of great assay results  This one has that kind of potential  I think it s set to have a really great summer  TGR  Who else is on your list  RM  I really like Terraco Gold Corp   TEN TSX V   It s a unique company  Besides the exploration potential on its Moonlight property in Nevada  its Almaden project in Idaho already has a significant gold resource and to this cowboy it certainly looks as if it s increasing the resource by metallurgical studies and huge drill holes  Instead of putting down the skinny drill holes  Terraco put down a four inch hole and the grade went up drastically  to 1 3 grams ton  Judging just on the basis of the internals of the deposit  it looks as if the company can increase the grade and the resource size simultaneously  TGR  That s terrific  RM  But it goes beyond the projects  Terraco has a royalty option an option to acquire up to a 2 5  net smelter royalty  NSR  on the Spring Valley gold project  which adjoins Terraco s Moonlight project in Nevada and is joint ventured between Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  and Midway Gold Corp   MDW TSX V  MWD NYSE A   A royalty is simply a right to receive a percentage of production from a mine  So when you invest in a royalty you re buying a percentage of the metal produced from a given property in exchange for an initial payment  but you re not assuming any responsibility for the actual mining operation  So Terraco doesn t have to contribute to the operating or capital costs at the mine after the initial payment is made  This is one of the things I like most about Terraco  TGR  Could you elaborate  Some investors may not understand the value of these royalties  RM  When thinking about how to value a junior gold company  you usually look at how many ounces it has in the ground  The company gets a certain amount of money for each one  say  90 113 oz in the ground  The market values royalties much higher  something like  800 oz and sometimes as high as  1 200 oz in the ground gold production  It s 800  higher than a normal company would be valued  TGR  What do you see when you look at Terraco in light of its royalty position  RM  When you do the math on Terraco  you can see why I like this company so much  Even if Spring Valley were to remain at 3 5 million ounces  Moz   75  recovery on  1 200 oz gold for the next 15 years at  650 oz gold cost at a 3  discount rate gives you  70M 80M net present value  NPV  minus the  12 5M to exercise the option  Using those very conservative numbers  that comes to about  57M NPV  These outstanding shares fully diluted put a  0 35 share base price on Terraco right now  You can see a minimum  a base that doesn t even include Moonlight or Almaden  which has 1 Moz and growing in a shallow open pit resource that could be a mine today  TGR  And Terraco s trading around  0 12  RM  A very good value play for anybody to look at  Terraco offers the Moonlight exploration upside  1 Moz of gold at Almaden with considerable upside because it s looking for higher grade feeder gold shoots coming up from underneath much like the Ken Snyder mine  and the royalty  TGR  Excellent  RM  It s hard to find value like a NioGold or a Terraco and the upside of an exploration program such as Altier s  TGR  Now that we ve heard about a few of your favorite gold mining companies  where shall we go next  RM  I want to talk about one more  a silver company  Based on 15 000m of widely scattered drilling  the first resource estimate that Kootenay Silver Inc   KTN TSX V  put out on its Promontorio silver project in Sonora  Mexico  showed 10 Moz silver  Total resource silver equivalent would be 21 Moz  Since then  the company has done another 35 000m of concentrated drilling  targeting the resource area in the pit and a 1 kilometer  km  strike length  and is about to release an updated resource estimate  I m pretty excited to see what it s going to be I expect a real barn burner of a resource  To top it off  the company now realizes its resource is in a diatreme system  These are large scale  grouped systems  such as Pe asquito  Not only does Kootenay have coming what I expect to be a significant upward revaluation in its early resource  but also some of the greatest blue sky potential you ll ever see on the exploration side  Management in all the companies I ve mentioned is exceptional  and Kootenay has one of the best run teams out there  It s definitely worth looking at just because of the quality of the management team  and it s definitely another one that people should have on their radar screens  TGR  And certainly  Mexico has been a great place to mine  whether it s gold or silver  Are you as bullish on silver as you are on gold  RM  Yes  I am  but I think you invest in these companies because of management  not because it s either gold or silver  While I believe that silver trades more as an industrial metal than a monetary metal  it trades in lock step with gold  Consequently  when gold goes parabolic for the reasons we discussed earlier  silver will ride right along with it  They re both going to be fantastic  TGR  You re apparently bullish on uranium  too  RM  Absolutely  The Japanese are turning reactors back on because the country has realized that the economy can t survive without nuclear power  Germany is finding out that the decision to shut down its nuclear power plants was perhaps a knee jerk reaction to what happened at Fukushima a political decision made in the haste of the moment and it is bitterly regretting it  I think we ll see a reversal there  And  you know  the Megatons to Megawatts program with Russia will end next year  The American government did sell off some high grade nuclear material but that was more of a political gesture in response to lobbying efforts on behalf of one of the more powerful Congressional districts to keep 1 200 people working  Uranium actually has been a very good contrarian play for a while  and now I believe we ll see much higher uranium prices over the coming years  TGR  Have you any companies you d like to mention in that context  RM  I do  Uranerz Energy Corp   URZ TSX  URZ NYSE A  potentially has two near term catalysts that would drive up its share price  Uranerz is approaching its one year anniversary for construction of its mine in Wyoming s Powder River Basin  Everything s going fantastically  The plant is erected  electrical work is ongoing  The only thing left is the plumbing  the only permit still to be issued is for the deep disposal well  The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  wanted some clarification  which Uranerz supplied  and now the company is waiting for the EPA to come back and approve the permit  The share price has been a little beaten down because it doesn t have the permit  Dealing with a government organization  you really can t put a timeline on it but I expect the permit to be in Uranerz s hands within a month  If that happens in August  the company will be in production in November  Those two catalysts receiving the final permit and moving quickly into production can put a swift kick in the butt of any company s share price  This is not going to be an insignificant producer  either  Uranerz will produce 300 000 pounds  lb  of yellowcake a year  It has a tolling agreement with Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE  to process resin and an offtake sales agreement with Exelon Generation Co  LLC  a subsidiary of Exelon Corp   EXC NYSE  to buy product for  65 75 lb  As I said  I believe all of this is potentially going to happen this year and it represents a fundamental change in the company s prospects  In an industry that is in a turnaround phase  as a contrarian investment  Uranerz represents probably the best value in the uranium sector today  TGR  Any other names outside of uranium and precious metals that you want to talk about  RM  Yes  a district size nickel play in Greenland  North American Nickel Inc  s  NAN TSX V  Maniitsoq project basically comprises a whole nickel belt 75km long and several kilometers wide  It has 119 drill holes  There s  all along the length of it  The company just released news that the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland  GEUS  has announced that the Maniitsoq structure represents the remains of a gigantic meteor impact 3 billion years ago  There s a lot of postulation that a meteor impact caused the nickel emplacement in the norites at Sudbury  Ontario   which fuels speculation that Maniitsoq could be another Sudbury  TGR  That would be a real plus  RM  It would be but I m not presently overly concerned about how the nickel was emplaced  To me what s important is that North American Nickel already has three extremely high quality targets and scads of nickel tenor  it s currently flying a Variable Time Domain ElectroMagnetic  VTEM  survey and will be drilling within a month  Then  if drilling results in good nickel intercepts and identifies nickel emplacements around the area that confirm that Maniitsoq may be another Sudbury  the stock will explode  It can t help but happen  What s important is that North American Nickel drills and hits nickel the basic  undeniable fact of this play is that North American Nickel owns it all  Other companies won t be coming in and staking ground  There won t be any sister plays or feed off plays or anything like that  Hit nickel here and we re going to experience potentially one of the biggest speculations that anyone has seen on the Toronto Venture Exchange  And that s not an embellishment  North American Nickel will own the whole camp  TGR  So you re fond of this nickel play  bullish on uranium and clearly enthusiastic about the precious metals companies you talked about  Is part of the rationale behind your thinking the idea that emerging economies and developing nations will be implementing infrastructure programs that need more energy  more steel and more base metals  Would you say you re generally a commodities bull  RM  I am a commodities bull  and although everything you just said is true  it goes deeper  It goes to the fact that a discovery is a discovery  and the market rewards discoveries  It rewards finding a resource and doubling it and tripling it  It rewards companies that go from near term producer status to producers with cash flow  It rewards management  those who go to work for shareholders  build value and run solid junior companies  It rewards those that run ahead of the herd  To me it doesn t matter whether we re in a bull market for commodities or a soft market  this kind of quality  this kind of shareholder value building  will be rewarded  It always has been and I see nothing going on now in the market to change that  When you add in what we talked about with inflationary pressures and gold potentially as a Tier 1 asset  I see this as a perfect time to be looking at these companies with great management teams and projects that can really increase their share value at any time  TGR  Excellent summary  Rick  Thank you so much for your time   is the founder  owner and president of Northern Venture Group  which
