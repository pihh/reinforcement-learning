115369,336884,TV,Will Charter Communications  CHTR  Lose Fox Networks Lineup ,opinion,"Leading cable MSO  multi service operator  Charter Communications Inc    NASDAQ CHTR   continues to be locked in a carriage dispute with Fox Networks  a unit of Twenty First Century Fox Inc    NASDAQ FOXA    Fox began warning Charter customers about service termination on Apr 7  2017  The three deadlines were on Apr 8  11 and 12  However no retransmission deal has been renewed so far 
If the dispute continues  over 16 million subscribers of Charter Communications  Spectrum TV may lose access to a wide variety of Fox Networks  programming  including the St  Louis Cardinals and Blues  Kansas City Royals  Cleveland Cavaliers  Cincinnati Reds and several other MLB  NBA and NHL teams on Fox Regional Sports Networks  together with FX s hit dramas  The Americans  and  Feud   and National Geographic 
Ever since Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in 2016  the company has been trying to get better deals from content providers and programmers  The cable MSO is pressing to leverage Time Warner Cable s more favorable Fox networks retransmission deal  instead of the original Charter Communications contract which has already expired 
In Jul 2016  Fox News sued the cable operator  claiming that the company had breached its contract by trying to apply Time Warner Cable s channel carriage rates and was not abiding by an agreement it signed with Fox to distribute Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network 
In the same month  leading U S  media giant CBS Corp    NYSE CBS   also filed breach of contract lawsuits against Charter Communications for the same reason  Interestingly  Charter Communications has structured its 2016 mega acquisitions in such a way that the newly combined MSO appears under the control of Time Warner Cable 
In Jan 2017  Hispanic TV network Univision Communications Inc   a subsidiary of Mexican cable TV and media behemoth  Grupo Televisa SA   NYSE TV   sued Charter Communications accusing the U S  cable company of breaching its TV carriage contract

Year to date the stock price of Charter Communications returned 16 22   outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 14 14   At present  the cable TV industry is facing a massive cord cutting threat and Charter Communications is no exception  We believe that is the primary reason behind the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

115394,336909,TV,Antitrust rules batter America Movil as uncertainty bites,news,"By Christine Murray MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Shares of billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil slumped on Thursday after regulators ratcheted up antitrust measures aimed at breaking Slim s hold on Mexican telecoms  adding uncertainty to the outlook for his principal cash cow  America Movil was the cornerstone of Slim s rise to top the global rich list for several years  but a 2013 14 telecoms reform imposed tougher antitrust rules on the company and helped open the door to new competitors  Long dominant America Movil  MX AMXL  said late on Wednesday that the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT  had decided to step up antitrust measures against it  sending the company s shares down more than 5 percent at Thursday s market open  The IFT said America Movil  the largest telecommunications company in the region  has to separate part of its network infrastructure into a new entity and that it will be subject to stricter checks on access to infrastructure  This could open up its network further to competitors at lower prices  but it also raises questions about how the measures will take shape  America Movil now has 65 working days to present a proposal for its new unit   A big thing is the uncertainty it adds   said Carlos Legarreta  an analyst at broker GBM   The implementation of this is surely going to be complicated   he said  adding that a similar measure against Britain s BT  L BT  took a year  America Movil s shares ended down 4 54 percent at 12 63 pesos on Thursday  Slim s company has also long wanted to get a license to offer pay television in Mexico  a service it has been banned from since Telmex s privatization in 1990  But after the new IFT measures  some analysts thought it would not happen soon  Intercam analyst Alik Garcia said he did not see the company getting a license under the current president  whose term in office ends in November 2018  and that even once approved  it may not be enough to counter the company s current woes   It s a business that doesn t have high margins     it wouldn t be a panacea   Garcia said  A spokeswoman for America Movil did not immediately return a request for comment  The IFT also imposed new rules on the dominant broadcaster and longstanding Slim antagonist Televisa  MX TLVACPO   including increased accounting transparency  but Televisa shares rose as analysts thought it could benefit from America Movil s problems  America Movil holds more than two thirds of Mexico s mobile subscriptions and dominates the country s fixed line and internet services while Televisa has a more than 60 percent market share of pay TV  In 2012  a study by the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development concluded that Mexican consumers were overcharged for phone and internet services  America Movil disputed the findings  Since the reforms  U S  wireless operator AT T Inc  N T  has entered the market and phone service prices have fallen  But in broadcasting  changes have been more gradual  IFT will strengthen oversight of Televisa s infrastructure sharing and require it to hand over detailed information on advertising prices  as well as provide separate accounts for each part of the business  the broadcaster said in a statement  Televisa said it will consider legal or business actions it could take in response  Slim s company was stronger in its criticism of the regulator and vowed to challenge the decision

115398,336913,TV,Grupo Televisa S A B  Earnings Analysis,opinion,"Grupo Televisa S A B reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31  2014 

Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa SA  NYSE TV   reported a 1 6 percent increase in fourth quarter profit to  2 5 B pesos   169 8 million   The company s earnings performance beat analyst expectations  as limited advertising growth due to government regulation was offset by increases in the number of satellite and cable TV viewers  The company continued to lead in the Mexico s pay TV market 

Fourth quarter revenue also came in better than expected  and rose 12 percent to  24 B pesos  Ad sales rose 3 8 percent  while licensing and syndication sales increased 17 percent 

However  uncertainty from increased regulation threatens the company  Under a proposal by Mexico s President Enrique Pena Nieto  the network will have to permit retransmission of its most popular channels for free 

This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Grupo Televisa S A B   TV TV Azteca Cpo  S A B  De C V   MX AZTECACPO  and America Movil SAB de CV  NYSE AMX  

Highlights

Summary numbers  Revenues of MXN 24 02 billion  Net Earnings of MXN 2 5 billion  and Earnings per Share  EPS  of MXN 0 81 

Gross margins widened from 58 41  to 61 36  compared to the same quarter last year  operating  EBITDA  margins now 39 34  from 37 92  

Ability to declare a higher earnings number  Change in operating cash flow of 14 29  compared to same quarter last year better than change in earnings 

Earnings rose compared to same quarter last year  despite decline in operating and pretax margins 

The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 



Market Share Versus Profits

Companies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth 



Compared to the same quarter last year  TLEVISACPO MX s change in revenue of 12 02  surpassed its change in earnings  which was 1 64   This suggests perhaps that TLEVISACPO MX s focus is on market share at the expense of bottom line earnings  However  this change in revenue is better than its peer average  pointing to perhaps some longer lasting success at wrestling market share from its competitors  and helping Capital Cube look past its weaker earnings performance this period  Also  for comparison purposes  revenues changed by 21 13  and earnings by 1 469 93  in the quarter ended September 30  2014 



Earnings Growth Analysis

The company s earnings growth was influenced by year on year improvement in gross margins from 58 41  to 61 36  as well as better cost controls  As a result  operating margins  EBITDA margins  rose from 37 92  to 39 34  compared to the same period last year  For comparison  gross margins were 62 14  and EBITDA margins were 40 11  in the quarter ending September 30  2014 



Gross Margin Trend

Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors  Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital  If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital  it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop up using the balance sheet 


TLEVISACPO MX s improvement in gross margins have been accompanied by a deterioration in the management of working capital  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the improvements in gross margins are likely accounting trade offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions  Its working capital days have risen to 134 51 days from last year s levels of 68 82 days 



Cash Versus Earnings   Sustainable Performance 

TLEVISACPO MX s year on year change in operating cash flow of 14 29  is better than its change in earnings  This suggests that the company might have been able to declare a higher earnings number  But  this change in operating cash flow is lower than the average of the results announced to date by its peer group 



Margins

Despite a decline in operating  EBIT  margins as well as a decline in pretax margins  the company s earnings rose

115434,336949,TV,Carlos Slim Taking Wrecking Ball To His Mexican Telecom Empire,opinion,"At first glance  it looked as if the condemned man had stolen the executioner s axe and cut off his own head rather than wait for the inevitable   Facing imminent antitrust legislation in Mexico aimed squarely at his telecom empire  Carlos Slim opted to act first with announced plans to break up America Movil  NYSE AMX   America Movil will spin off some of its fixed line and mobile assets into a new  independent company  and it will also spin off its wireless towers 
Slim is no dummy  he knew the jig was up and he figured he could better shape the outcome if he acted early   America Movil  70  of the mobile phone market and 80  of landlines  and its dominance in the Mexican market and the lack of significant competition has led Mexico to have some of the most expensive communications costs in the world 
The OECD  last year that found Mexico to be the most expensive of twelve major markets for a basic talk  text and data mobile phone plan   And  of broadband internet costs by country had Mexico s service ranked as the 16th most expensive in the world  more than three times more expensive than that of the United States after adjusting for incomes 
AMX stock has been rallying on the news of the breakup  shares are up more than 10  since Tuesday   Investors have taken the view that the divestures and subsequent competition which will bring America Movil s market share to below the 50  threshold at which the Mexican government would impose penalties will be less damaging than the potential punitive actions by the Mexican government 
So  what does this mean for AMX stock and for its largest single competitor in Latin America  Spain s Telefonica  NYSE TEF  
To start  this will  by default  massively diversify AMX s revenue stream globally   Though AMX is the number one or number two mobile provider in nearly every Latin American country  its home market of Mexico is by far its biggest   Mexico currently accounts for about a third of sales and nearly half of profits   The new AMX will be a pan Latin American telecom giant based in Mexico rather than a Mexican telecom giant with operations in Central and South America 
Over the next year or two  I would expect AMX s restructuring to be a major distraction for management  which should all else equal be a boon to Telefonica  But the Mexican divestures are likely to make Carlos Slim all the more aggressive in pursuing growth outside of Mexico once the dust settles 
Within Mexico  the picture is somewhat cloudy   AMX has indicated it prefers to sell the bulk of the assets to a single buyer in order to create a competitor strong enough to appease Mexican regulators   That could mean that Telefonica steps up and increases its presence in Mexico  though Bloomberg reported that broadcasting juggernaut Grupo Televisa  NYSE TV  could be the strongest contender 
More details on Slim s plans will be coming in the coming weeks   But one point should be immediately obvious   The biggest winner here will be neither America Movil nor Telefonica but rather the Mexican consumers who should soon be benefitting from increased competition and lower prices   That may mean lower margins for AMX and TEF in their Mexican operations  at least for a time   But if AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  can profitably coexist in the brutally competitive U S  market  then investors in AMX and TEF should have nothing to worry about

115455,336970,TV,Exclusive  Televisa affiliate surfaces in widening FIFA bribery probe,news,"By Mica Rosenberg NEW YORK  Reuters    An unnamed company described in a sweeping probe of corruption in soccer s world governing body FIFA matches the description of a close affiliate of Grupo Televisa  MX TLVACPO   the largest broadcaster in Latin America  according to a Reuters review of U S  and Swiss government documents  In court papers filed on Tuesday  U S  prosecutors said an affiliate of a major broadcasting company headquartered in Latin America helped to pay millions of dollars in bribes to obtain the rights for the next four World Cup tournaments in Argentina  Paraguay and Uruguay  Reuters has determined that the affiliate is Mountrigi Management Group Ltd   a Swiss company formed by Televisa that obtained the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 games in those countries and across the region  Swiss company registration documents show that Mountrigi and Televisa are registered in that country under the same address and share several board members   The court documents do not state that either the companies or their executives are targets of the investigation  Neither company has been charged with wrongdoing    We have no knowledge it refers to us   a Televisa spokesman said in an email  adding that the Department of Justice has not contacted the company to ask about the FIFA case  In the court documents  prosecutors said  Broadcasting Company Executive  1  helped pay the bribes to the FIFA official  The Televisa spokesman denied the documents referred to one of its executives  Reuters was unable to determine the identity of the executive    We are certain all of the people from Mountrigi or Televisa that have dealt with FIFA have acted correctly and have not paid any bribes nor any kickback to FIFA official related to the acquisition of rights   the Televisa spokesman said   Willi Dietschi  a Swiss attorney who is listed in Swiss company registration documents as the president of the board of directors of both Mountrigi and Televisa s corporate entity in Switzerland  referred questions to the Latin American broadcaster   John Marzulli  a spokesman for the U S  Attorney for the Eastern District of New York located in Brooklyn  which is handling the case  declined to comment  The reference marks the first time a Mexican company has come under scrutiny by U S  prosecutors in the sweeping FIFA investigation  Mexican broadcasters have played an outsized role in international soccer since the early days of the sport s move into lucrative television markets   So far 43 individuals and businesses from 20 countries have been indicted by U S  prosecutors on racketeering  wire fraud  money laundering and other charges arising from the probe  Twenty people and two related companies have pleaded guilty   OTHER BROADCASTERS Other unnamed broadcasters have previously been referred to by prosecutors in the wide ranging investigation  which exploded on to the international stage in May 2015 when law enforcement agents swept into a luxury hotel in Zurich and arrested more than half a dozen top FIFA officials  An unnamed Miami sports marketing company that appeared in the indictment coinciding with the arrests turned out to be Media World  an affiliate of Spanish media giant Imagina Group  Later that year the FBI raided Media World s offices  and two executives pleaded guilty in the case  They have yet to be sentenced   Another sports marketing company described in a superseding indictment as having paid bribes has longstanding ties to the U S  entertainment company 21st Century Fox  NWSNA UL   according to securities filings and other government documents   Fox has not been accused of wrongdoing and has declined to comment on the case  A media company could potentially be held criminally liable for bribery if it benefited from a wrongful payment and its employees had knowledge of or were willfully blind to the transaction  legal experts have said   LATEST ALLEGATIONS  The allegations relating to the Latin American broadcaster surfaced in papers filed on Tuesday in Brooklyn as part of a hearing on a deferred prosecution agreement between U S  authorities and another company  the Argentine sports marketer Torneos y Competencias   Torneos agreed to pay more than  112 million in penalties for wire fraud conspiracy  In the criminal charging documents filed against Torneos  prosecutors allege that a wholly owned subsidiary   called TyC International   obtained the rights to broadcast future World Cup tournaments through a series of contracts with a major Latin American broadcaster s affiliate   That affiliate went on to pay millions of dollars in bribe and kickback payments to a high ranking FIFA official with  enormous influence  to secure the World Cup rights  prosecutors allege  Those rights were awarded long before the host countries were even picked for some of the tournaments  After FIFA awarded the World Cup rights in 2018 to Mountrigi Management  the company licensed them to TyC international  FIFA documents show  Torneos declined to comment

115550,337065,TV,Exclusive  Embattled Mexican builder ICA CEO Quintana leaving post   sources,news,"By Alexandra Alper and Roberto Aguilar
MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Alonso Quintana Kawage  chief executive of Mexico s cash strapped construction company ICA  MX ICA   is leaving his post  two sources familiar with the matter said  as the company struggles to renegotiate its multi billion dollar debt load 
The move is part of a wider restructuring aimed at regaining investor confidence after the company s steep slump into debt and a cash crunch under Quintana  the grandson of ICA s founder and who became CEO in 2012 
Both sources said that veteran company executive Luis Zarate would now be appointed CEO  while one of the sources said that current Co Chief Executive Alfonso Gonzalez Migoya would remain in his post 
According to one person familiar with the matter  Quintana would still sit on ICA s board and could be given a new position at the company 
A spokesman for the company declined to comment 
The firm  which has defaulted on about  60 million in interest payments since December  saw its net debt reach 51 147 billion pesos   2 97 billion  in the third quarter as a slump in the peso caused its dollar debt value to balloon 
ICA s shares are down 68 percent over the past year  making it the worst performing stock on the IPC index 
ICA s corporate reshuffle has been unrolled at a dizzying pace  as the firm  which built iconic structures like the towering headquarters of state oil giant Pemex  has sought to convince skeptical investors it is charting a new course 
Orlando Loera  who led the restructuring of Mexican homebuilder Geo over the last three years  was named chief restructuring officer in December  But he was quickly replaced by Guadalupe Phillips  a former Grupo Televisa  MX TLVACPO  vice president  in January 
Gonzalez Migoya  non executive chairman of low cost airline Volaris  was brought on as co CEO in December to help carry out the company s operational and financial restructuring while Quintana continued to run operations 
Still  calls for Quintana s ouster began months before the current management shift  one source said 
According to two people familiar with the matter  the latest bout of pressure came from the board  which is presided over by Quintana s father  Bernando Quintana Isaac  and includes other family members  Quintana Isaac served as CEO from 1994 to 2006 
Aided by Rothschild and FTI Consulting  ICA  which has also been hit by a slump in government infrastructure spending  vowed to draw up a restructuring plan by mid February 
But even as the company has made offers to banks to restructure debt  according to two sources and a document seen by Reuters  the lack of liquidity has hampered ICA s efforts 

One person familiar with the matter expects a plan to be presented in March  The company is slated to report fourth quarter earnings next week ",2016-02-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-embattled-mexican-builder-ica-ceo-quintana-leaving-post---sources-385915,385915

115656,337171,TV,Mexico s president signs telecoms reform rules into law,news,"MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico s President Enrique Pena Nieto on Monday signed into law new rules for the telecommunications and broadcasting industries that are designed to curb the power of billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil and broadcaster Televisa 
The legislation  approved by Congress last week  fleshes out a constitutional reform that Pena Nieto pushed through Congress last year to spur greater competition in the telecommunications market that is dominated by Slim 
 This reform will promote greater competition  more and better conditions  better coverage and service quality  as well as lower prices and costs   Pena Nieto said at an event in Mexico City where he spoke before government officials and telecoms industry executives 
Approval of so called secondary laws was delayed about eight months  complicating the work of a new regulator that is charged with reducing the power of broadcaster Televisa  which dominates television markets  and America Movil 
America Movil  which has some 70 percent of Mexico s mobile market and over 60 percent of fixed lines  said last week it would sell assets to avoid regulations that force the company to lower connection costs for competitors and share infrastructure 

After finishing the telecommunications bill last week  lawmakers are now turning toward legislation that will complete the government s most ambitious reform  the opening of Mexico s oil and gas industry to private investment after a 75 year state monopoly
