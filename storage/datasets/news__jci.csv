Financial Officer  Brian Stief Before we begin  I like to remind you that during the course of today s call  we will be providing certain forward looking information  We ask that you review today s press release and read through the forward looking cautionary informational statements that we ve included there  In addition  we will use certain non GAAP measures in our discussions  and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items In discussing our results during the call  references to adjusted EBITA  adjusted EBIT margins exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items  These metrics are non GAAP measures and are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to the presentation posted on our website Additionally  all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis  excluding the results of Power Solutions GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Johnson Controls ordinary shareholders was  0 21 for the quarter and included a net charge of  0 19 related to special items  which Brian will address in his comments  Excluding these special items  non GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was  0 40 per share compared to  0 26 in the prior year quarter Now let me turn the call over to George George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Antonella  and good morning everyone  Thank you for joining us on today s call  Before we get into the details of the quarter  I would like to provide a few thoughts as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2020 Starting on Slide 3  we continue to see good momentum across the majority of our key performance metrics  with Q1 providing a strong start to the year  We saw 70 basis points of margin expansion this quarter  this resulted from a reduction in structural costs  improved project execution  accelerated service growth  expansion in gross margins  and driving innovation  All of these initiatives will remain key focal point for us as we go forward  We ve also made significant progress in improving our cash generation profile  with important steps toward better management of our trade working capital and continued discipline around capex spending  We sure have more work to do to bring free cash conversion up to 100  on a sustainable basis  but I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made to date As we will discuss on the next slide  orders were flat in the quarter  but I am confident given the continued strength we see in our pipeline  we will see acceleration in Q2  Our primary end markets  commercial HVAC  building controls  fire and security  remain healthy and we are well positioned as leaders in each market  We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet over the course of the last nine months with ample flexibility when it comes to future capital deployment opportunities Finally  as I ve said many times on these calls over the last couple of years  we remain intently focused on execution in building a strong performance culture to drive sustained performance and maximize shareholder value Turning to some of the details for the quarter  starting with orders on Slide 4  Orders for our field businesses were flat  in aggregate in Q1  as we faced tough prior year comparisons given the timing of announced price increases  Last year our announced price increases were effective in January  which resulted in a pull forward into Q1 fiscal  19  This year  we accelerated our announced price increases to be effective in October  which resulted in a pull forward into late fiscal  19  Looking forward  our order pipeline remains robust with an attractive mix of service and a balanced profile of small and large projects  We expect order growth in Q2 to be in the mid single digit range and we remain very confident in our low to mid single digit growth target for the full year  Backlog ended the quarter at  9 billion  up 6  organically versus the prior year and up 2  on a quarter sequential basis  which provides high visibility through 2020 Turning now to Slide 5  for a quick recap of the financial results in the quarter  Sales of  5 6 billion  increased 3  on an organic basis  Within the field businesses  total service revenues grew 3  in the quarter on top of mid single digit growth in the prior year  Our service business represents over  6 billion in revenues or a little more than 40  of our field revenue base and provides us with a very profitable resilient revenue stream  As growing and expanding our service offering has been a key priority  we recently appointed a dedicated Global Service  Indecipherable   Ganesh Ramaswamy joined the team from Danaher and will drive improved consistency of fundamentals across our global direct channel  leverage our infrastructure and investments and work closely with regional leaders to execute on our strategic priorities  With the strength and depth of our portfolio  we have a tremendous opportunity to strengthen our core service business  while building and deploying new service solutions  leveraging our digital capabilities Adjusted EBIT of  448 million  grew 13  on an organic basis driven by solid 7  growth in segment profit and a continued focus on reducing corporate expense  Overall  underlying EBIT margins expanded 80 basis points year over year  excluding a 10 basis point headwind from FX Adjusted EPS of  0 40  increased 54  over the prior year with solid operational performance and a significant contribution from the deployment of proceeds related to the Power Solutions sale  Adjusted free cash was an outflow of under  100 million in the quarter  in line with our normal seasonal pattern  but a significant improvement over the last two years With that  I will turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in more detail Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerThanks George  and good morning everyone  So let s get started with a look at our year over year EPS bridge on Slide 6  You can see that operational performance  including synergies and productivity save contributed  0 06  Phonetic   deployment of the Power Solutions proceeds benefit both our year over year share count and net financing charges  which added  0 06 for the  0 03 respectively  Other net items in the first quarter were roughly  0 01  This results in our first quarter adjusted EPS of  0 40  up 54  year on year So let s move to Slide 7 and look at our segment results on a consolidated basis  Sales of  5 6 billion  increased 3  organically  led by 4  growth in our field businesses and 2  in Global Products  Segment EBITA of  625 million  grew 7  organically  driven by volume leverage from the field  strong price cost realization in our products businesses and continued productivity save and cost synergies  Lastly  Q1 segment EBITA margin expanded 40 basis points to 11 2   If you look at the margin waterfall  underlying operational improvement contributed 50 basis points and this included a 10 basis point headwind related to our retail business in North America  This was partially offset by 10 bps for other items in the quarter Now let s take a look at each segment in more detail  So starting on Slide 8  North America  North America sales grew 3  organically  with balanced growth in both install and service activity  Growth was led by Fire   Security  which grew mid single digits in the quarter led by higher install activity  Our applied HVAC and Control businesses  increased low single digits in the quarter given the double digit growth in equipment last year  Performance Solutions declined low double digits this quarter  due primarily to a tough prior year compare of over 30  As we expected  adjusted EBITA increased 2  and EBITA margin was in line with the prior year at 12   Favorable volume leverage and benefits from synergy and productivity save were offset by a 30 basis point headwind related to our retail business  And as we mentioned on our Q4 call  we expected to see continued margin headwind in retail  given the change in mix to increased project revenue Orders declined in the quarter  as George mentioned  This was primarily due to the timing of price increases in our applied HVAC business  which did provide a 3 percentage point headwind  We expected to start the year off a bit slower in North America  but we re confident that orders will accelerate to mid single digit range in Q2  given current pipeline activity  Backlog in North America remained strong at  5 8 billion  up 7  year over year Turning to EMEA LA on Slide 9  Sales grew 7  organically with install up 10  and service up 5   Growth was positive across all regions and across HVAC   Controls  Fire   Security and Industrial Refrigeration  Our HVAC   Controls business grew high single digits  helped in part by easier prior year compare  but also benefiting from order strength in the back half of 2019 for shorter cycle Controls business  Growth was particularly strong in Europe  which increased low double digits and in the Middle East  which was a soft spot through fiscal  19  we saw mid single digit growth  Fire   Security grew mid single digit  with solid growth across both Install and Service activity and in all regions  led by mid teens growth in our subscriber business in Latin America  Industrial Refrigeration  which was predominantly in Europe  remains a bright spot in the region  It was up high teens in the quarter with solid growth in both Install and Service Adjusted EBITA increased 21  and EBITA margin expanded 120 basis points to 9 7   We continue to benefit from favorable volume leverage  as well as our continued efforts around reducing structural costs and improving project execution  Indecipherable  our orders in EMEA LA increased 4   this was led by continued strength in our Controls platform  particularly in Latin America  Orders in Europe were up slightly on a tough prior year compare and backlog ended the quarter at  1 7 billion  up 8  year on year Let s move to Slide 10 on APAC  APAC sales grew 3  organically  led by higher demand for project installations  which grew 5  in the quarter  Fire   Security  which as you know  represents about 30  of APAC sales  saw continued strength of low single digits overall  HVAC   Controls  which represents remaining 70  of APAC sales was relatively flat year over year Adjusted EBITA increased 8   with margins up 60 basis points to 11 4   Favorable volume leverage productivity and synergy save and improved execution were partially offset by higher mix of install versus service in the quarter  Asia Pac orders were up 1  against the tough 9  prior year compare  consistent with the trend we ve seen over the last several quarters  Backlog in APAC  increased 2  year over year to  1 6 billion I just point out that the environment in APAC remains competitive and economic conditions in some areas remain uncertain  We continue to experience macro related headwinds in some of our key markets in Asia  including the ongoing trade dispute and now the Coronavirus  which are overhangs in China as well as the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong  That being said  we are seeing nice improvement in the underlying fundamentals in our APAC businesses  but we are monitoring the situations very closely So let s turn to Slide 11  Global Products  Global Products sales in the quarter increased 2  organically  driven primarily by strong price realization  We saw BMS sales grow high single digits in this quarter  despite a low double digit compare in the prior year  And this was led by strength in our security products business  HVAC and Refrigeration equivalent was flat  with mixed performance across the individual platforms I d also point out that we have recently restructured our distribution channels in Canada to allow us to better serve the residential and light commercial markets and to accelerate our growth  Total resi HVAC declined low single digits  driven by a high single digit decline in our APAC residential business as well as a mid single digit decline in our North American business  Let me go through that in a bit more detail  So as we detailed for you last quarter  we expected continued pressure in our APAC residential business  primarily due to the softer market conditions in Japan  Our North American business was negatively impacted in the quarter by the Canadian distribution restructuring I mentioned previously as well as the lower than expected shipments in our furnace business  due to lower heating degree days in the quarter  Given the low double digit prior year compare  we expect this weakness to continue into the second quarter Light commercial unitary grew low single digits on low teens prior year compare  with sales in North America flat due to weakness in our national accounts business  Our VRF business continues to outperform  growing mid single digits while our applied HVAC equipment declined mid single digits  primarily due to the pressures in APAC  We continue to see very strong demand for replacement chillers in North America  IR equipment grew mid single digits in the quarter  helped by a relatively easy prior year compare  Finally  specialty products grew low single digits on solid demand for fire suppression products  particularly in North America Product segments EBITA increased 6  and the EBITA margin expanded 40 basis points  as the underabsorption on lower volumes was more than offset by positive price cost and the ongoing benefit of cost synergies and productivity So let s move to Slide 12 and corporate expense  Corporate expense was down 13  year over year to  81 million  driven primarily by the continued benefits of synergy and productivity save as well as our ongoing actions to reduce our cost structure  given the Power Solutions divestiture On Slide 13  free cash flow  Reported Q1 free cash flow was just under  400 million  excluding a little more than  100 million in one time cash outflows related to integration and the  600 million tax refund that we received in the quarter  adjusted free cash was an outflow of less than  100 million  which is a  100 million improvement versus last year  This was primarily due to continued improvement in working capital management as we saw trade working capital as a percentage of sales decline 60 basis points  We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow conversion of 95   excluding the  300 million in one time cash outflows related primarily integration and the  600 million tax refund So let me turn to the balance sheet on Slide 14  Net debt was up slightly as we continue to deploy cash toward share repurchases despite Q1 being our seasonally weak cash generation quarter  You can see share repurchases in the quarter were  650 million  roughly in line with the cadence that we expect for the full year Before I turn it back to George for his closing remarks  I d want to briefly mention a couple of items on Slide 15  First  during the quarter we recorded restructuring impairment charge of  111 million  about half of that is cash and about half of that is non cash  And the cash impact of that  we ll expect to see in the current year and is included in our guidance  The cash restructuring charge reflects costs associated with the final year of the JCI  Tyco merger integration activities as well as the ongoing reduction in costs related to the Power Solutions divestiture  Secondly  in the quarter we recorded a non cash charge of  30 million related to Swiss tax reform and this will not impact our 13 5  rate for the year  And then lastly  we also adopted a new accounting standard related to operating leases  which results in a gross up of other non current assets and other current and non current liabilities in our balance sheet So overall  we re off to a great start in fiscal  20  with strong earnings and cash flow  and improving margins And with that  I ll turn it back over to George George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Brian  Before we open up the line for questions  I just want to reiterate that we continue to expect our fiscal 2020 earnings per share before special items to be in the range of  2 50 to  2 60  which represents earnings growth of 28  to 33   We have included the full details of our guidance as previously provided in the appendix to the slides Our first quarter reflects    results reflect a strong start to the fiscal year and a continued commitment to solid execution and to improving the underlying fundamentals of our business  I m confident that we are well positioned to deliver continued long term shareholder value With that operator  please open up the lines for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you sir  At this time we will begin our Q A session   Operator Instructions  Our first question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research  Mr  Coe  your line is open Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  Good morning guys George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Nigel Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystJust    obviously nice margin trends in the Asia Pac and EMEA  Latin America segments  You ve had some challenges  especially in Asia Pacific  do you feel like you are now in a better position going forward and based on the backlog and the mix kind of outlook  do you expect to continue to see sort of margin leadership from those two segments George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Nigel  we ve    we ve made really nice progress as Brian talked about within the margin structure within Asia Pac  With the growth being low single digits  we worked    this quarter we delivered 60 basis points year on year and that s also with unfavorable mix  with our installed growth growing faster than service  But I think the fundamentals  the way that we re pricing  the way that we re selling value  all of that is playing out within the structure and we believe that now with the fundamentals we re going to continue to improve on a go forward basis Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerI would just add to that  in 2018 Nigel  as you probably recall  we took a restructuring charge and some of that related to our European businesses  And I think we re really seeing the benefit in  19 and now into  20 of the results of some of those actions that were taken in 2018 Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  thank you  And then my follow up is your comments on the residential HVAC markets  we all know it s quite a warm winter  but very warm winter  but the comments on continued challenges in 2Q  is that more a function of the some of the restructuring you re doing in Canada or is that a friction more of the market George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNigel  what I would say  it s both  When you look at our performance here in Q1  it s been mainly    globally you know we re down a bit and a lot of that s driven by our performance or the market in Japan  which we re down in line with the margin    market in Japan  In North America  it s been    it s been too  When you look at the overall furnace market  we re extremely strong in that space and that market is down kind of high single digits  And right now that s continuing  and when you look at our restructuring of our Canadian distribution channels  what we ve done is we ve taken multiple channels  we ve consolidated that and now we re going to be expanding our points of distribution to be able to effectively now be much better position to accelerate growth in that that region  That is all playing out here in the first and second quarter and will be positioned in the second half to be able to pick up from a growth standpoint from there Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks George  thanks Brian OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research  Mr  Sprague  your line is open Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystThank you  good morning everyone  And thanks for pulling your call up to kind of accommodate all of us  I appreciate that  On    George on the price kind of pull forward on orders  we normally think of that being potentially kind of a residential phenomenon  but not something that would kind of impact the larger company given the nature of kind of applied and commercial projects  So you just kind of speak to how broadly the timing of orders  might have been affected by pricing and your kind of visibility on Q2 orders George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean we ve    historically we ve had our price increases in January  And as we ve been working on price cost over the last couple of years  we ve made a lot of progress  And so as we have been planning for 2020  we made a decision to pull forward  And with that  with the announcements there is a behavior that goes along with those announcements  And when you look at last year in  for instance in North America  we had high teens growth in our    in our product last year in North America because of price being effective in January  When we announced the increase in coming    being pulled into October  certainly we benefited in the fourth quarter of last year because of the same    the same phenomenon  So there is    there is a behavior around our price increases  What I would tell you Jeff is that the underlying activity is very strong across the board  Our pipelines pretty much across the board are high single digits  mid to high single digits and so my confidence in being able to deliver low to mid single digit order growth in the second quarter and be positioned here for the year is very strong and that ultimately correlates to the revenue that we re projecting for the total year Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerAnd Jeff  just to quantify the impact of that for you  When you look at our overall field orders they would be up low single digits on an underlying basis Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystOkay  thank you for that  And just on investment spend  not called out in the bridge  has this now kind of normalized and it will just kind of track with revenue growth from here or should we expect kind of other initiatives  maybe to pop up and be part of the earnings equation George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  as we ve committed over the last couple of years  our reinvestment in the sales channels as well as the reinvestment in products now as a percent of revenue is flattening out in 2020 and beyond  And so what s happening Jeff is that we re continuing to add sales in line with what we see with the market activity to be  So we re continuing to add sales  but we re getting productivity with all of the  the expansion that we done last couple of years In engineering and R D  we re continuing to obviously increase the dollars with the reinvestment  but maintaining that now as a percent of the overall revenue that s being achieved  And so we feel good and we re also similarly    we re doing combining the footprint  we re making sure that we re getting good productivity on the dollars that we re spending and ultimately tracking that to the new product introductions that we re bringing to market to make sure that we re getting the appropriate volumes and returns on those investments Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystRight  thank you  Appreciate it OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Market  Your line is open sir Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Good morning George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Deane Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystI just want to follow up on Jeff s questions on pricing  and George  so just so we re clear  will price increases be more of a dynamic decision based upon material costs or will there be a strategy around anticipating customer behavior  just address the timing of price increases going forward George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  What I d say Deane  if you go back two years ago  we had negative price cost and the market    with the market changes we weren t positioned to be able to move quickly to stay ahead of that  We ve made significant improvement now building out our strategic pricing capability across our businesses  So it is more dynamic  we re tracking the markets  we re tracking our win loss  we re making sure that we re    we re selling value and bringing value propositions to our customers instead of just annual price increase  Now there is historically that s what s happened within the industry we re in  but I believe that now we re much more dynamic relative to what s happening in the markets that we re serving  And as a result of that you saw nice progress with our  with our price cost last year  we actually turned the headwind that we had in  18 to a tailwind in  19 and that s continuing now in 2020  with probably    I estimate over a point of our topline will be driven by continued very positive price cost Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  And then just as a follow up  now that they ve declared the Coronavirus  a global health emergency  I know your 2020 guidance does not anticipate impacts  but it s likely happening given all the shutdowns going on  any sense of where and how you re tracking  steps you re taking internally  just anything you could share will be helpful  Thanks George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  what I would start by saying about 6  of our revenue is achieved in China  So overall it is    it is significant  but in the grand scheme relatively small  We ve been working very well across all of our teams that are positioned in China  We ve got not only all of the business units totally aligned  but we ve got full support of our EHS professionals  our facilities leaders  and security where we get a daily update from our Asia Pac leader  Certainly a top priority for us to    to make sure that all of our people  Phonetic  are safe and protecting them  As you know  most provinces have mandatory holiday extension now through February 10  And that most of the travel within China now has been curbed or curbed significantly And so what we    we are also assessing the supply side to have a pulse on what s happening with our supply  There could be some supply changes disruptions to date  it s been minimal  What I would say it is a fluid situation and that we re monitoring it very closely  At this stage Deane  it s hard to assess  difficult to assess but    but could have some deferral of activity  I mean certainly we ll have to keep everyone updated Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research  Your line is open sir Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystHi  good morning guys George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Scott Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystI don t fixate too much in the price  thinks it s been beaten to death  but it s pretty interesting that after all these years  pulling it forward to October  did    where the competitors been    did they do the same thing or are you out there for a whole quarter with higher prices generally than your competitors and that would have had some negative volume impact perhaps George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I believe that given the way the price increases occur within the industry  We re now ahead and so far we had the issue that last year we had a very strong first quarter with our HVAC equipment  And then this year because we had pulled it forward we had seen some of that benefit Scott  in the fourth quarter of last year and then what I would tell you is that when you look at the underlying pipeline and how the pipeline converts  we have a very strong pipeline  it s high single digits  we usually there is pretty good predictability of how we convert in the percent  And so I have confidence that we re going to get back to  like I said kind of low to mid single digit order growth in the second quarter and for the year  Very strong pipeline to deliver the mid single digit so  I mean overall we re    we re in line with where we thought we d be Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  Yeah  it s just the mechanics are interesting  My follow up is just on the replacement show  the North America replacement chiller market  is there a sense of    never seen the data out there on kind of each of the installed base  when you re talking about the bigger the bigger chillers  is there a sense that the installed base is old  And there is a long tail that there is a greater sense of upgrading  replacement for energy efficiency  Any    just some of that is a little bit obvious  but just trying to get a sense of how long that tail of demand is George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean it s all of the above  I think given the value proposition with our new chillers and the ability to be able to reduce energy consumption and drive efficiency  certainly a big value proposition there  And so it s looked at in total value  So when you look at what their current cost is to maintain and what the energy consumption is  we typically will go in and create a value proposition that not only we can improve their operating cost  but also reduce energy  So you got to look at it as in total cost  And so I think as we know launch new products  we bring our digital capabilities and how we optimize the operation of the equipment  how that integrates with the overall building systems I think there s is a real attractive value proposition for our customers  So we ve seen a nice pick up there Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  thanks  Helpful  thanks  Good luck  guys and good job this year  Thank you George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Scott OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse  Your line is open sir John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerGood morning John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystI guess a question around the retail business  you know  you ve kind of called it out the last couple of quarters  It s now in the    in the bridge  just wondering it can be lumpy  how long should we expect to kind of hear you calling out the retail headwind as it relates to the North America business George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  John our retail business when you size the business  it s roughly about  900 million  We have a presence globally  we are the industry leader  I mean loss prevention  inventory intelligence  traffic insights  it s a very profitable business because there is a high value proposition for our retail customers  And now that all being said  there s been lots of change in the industry given the proliferation of online shopping  requiring as we look at our overall offering toward digital solutions  a lot more installations that occurred during the quarter  but I believe that with the value proposition  the way that we are aligned  we re going to continue to see    see the business perform  but there s going to be a different mix within the business  So it s something that we re watching carefully  We re working very closely with each one of our retail customers and laying out what the year looks like  and how we re going to be positioned to be able to support    support their year  but it is given    given what s happening within the retail space  there is a lot of change that s happening  And we re going to make sure that we re positioned to be able to capitalize on that change and support the customers through that John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you for that  Then I guess  you know in the past you ve talked about the impact around PFAS and the AFFF  wondering if you can just provide us any kind of update there George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  there is no change in our position  You have to keep this in perspective  Tyco and Chemguard make lifesaving firefighting foam  not PFAS chemicals  And Tyco and Chemguard purchase compounds that contain trace amounts of PFAS  which they blend to make the foam  And their firefighting foam is made to exactly military standards  So majority of the foam at issue is specified and used by the US government and military and therefore subject to the government contractors  defense  And so Tyco fire products and Chemguard have always acted responsibly in producing these firefighting foams  and therefore we feel very confident in our ability to defend these clients But I also would like to share a few other facts  PFAS chemicals have been used by other companies since the 1940s  in many  many products and applications and we didn t start producing firefighting foam until the mid 1970s  which was over 30 years later and these foams are used only intimately and predominantly at very specific sites such as military bases  And then last is when you look at third party scientific studies that also recognize that firefighting foam accounts for only a very small percentage of PFAS that has historically been used in the country So overall position hasn t changed  We feel very good  Given what we ve done for our government  military customers and certainly there s really no additional updates John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  Good quarter and thanks for the update OperatorThank you for your question  Our next call or question  I m sorry  is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan  Your line is open sir Stephen Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystHey guys  good morning George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Steve Stephen Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystWhat s going on in the    so I think one of your businesses in North America  I think was down  it was the Solutions business or something  Is that like the performance contracting business  you guys still do that stuff Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean our Solutions business are the large performance contract Steve  And as we ve always talked the order intake on that can be pretty choppy  given the size of the contracts and then the flow of those contracts can give you some pretty significant variations quarter to quarter  but it s not a huge part of our business  but it can impact when we talk about that particular business  you can have some big swings quarter to quarter Stephen Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And then any    just to kind of level set people  any color on whether the second quarter  any stand out as far as abnormal seasonality anywhere    you know you mentioned orders  do you expect the orders to pick up a bit  Anything on free cash or the underlying business results that we need to kind of keep in mind for second quarter George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSteve  I ll take that  On the organic growth we re looking at low single digits and that s again against a prior year compare of 6   When you break that out  the field businesses will be low to mid single digit and that s to a compare of 5  and products will continue low single digits and that s to a compare of 7 so overall continued performance on the top line  there will be  as Brian mentioned within products  some additional pressure here in Q2 on North America resi  but as we go through the year  we still feel very good in the second half of the year  The EBITDA margins expanding in line with the guidance for the year  40 basis points to 60 basis points and we see expansion across all segments  And as you know  the normal seasonality to our year is typically  Indecipherable  in the first half  17  in the second half  But because of the share repo this year  it s a little bit more skewed to the first half And then when you look at the overall consensus  it is in line with our guidance for the year  And the guidance that I reiterated earlier was EPS range of  2 50 to  2 60  and that would be an increase Steve of 28  to 33  Stephen Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerI would just add to that Steve I think from a corporate expense standpoint  we had a pretty low quarter as is probably seen in the past  the second quarter tends to be a little bit higher  So I think we re    our guidance that s out there for corporate expense is still pretty solid as we sit here today  And then when it looked    when you look at cash flow  I think cash flow we would continue to see some improvement like we saw in the first quarter  So I think all in all  we feel real good about the second quarter Stephen Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystGeorge  just one more quick follow up on the    on just the general strategic question  I don t think anybody s asked it yet  but obviously a lot of these companies progressing on their splits  how do you guys view    any change in your view on kind of the strategic imperative to grow the residential business structurally George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean we ve been focused  when you look at our strategy Steve  we ve been focused on executing and getting the fundamentals in place  delivering on our commitments and ultimately driving results  That s the focus for us here in 2020  we ve been returning in line with what we committed a significant amount of capital to our    capital to our shareholders and we have a lot of underlying momentum across the organization  Whether it d be the margin fundamentals on how we re launching new products  we re upgrading our leadership and ultimately now deploying our digital strategy So I think when you look at our positions  that s one that we ve been investing heavily    the residential space is we ve been investing heavily with new  new products and technology  We are seeing progress because it is a critical element of our line card and how we ultimately support our customers and so we re going to continue to stay focused on executing  on delivering on the commitments  and certainly keeping a pulse on what s happening within the industry as far as any type of consolidation Stephen Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  Thanks for the detail as always  I appreciate it OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Your line is open Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning  May be    Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerGood morning Julian Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystGood morning  Maybe just a question around the EMEA LA region  The Middle East  Africa piece for you and a lot of your competitors that s been pretty soft for much of the past sort of 12 months to 18 months  albeit lumpy  I think you sounded better  Brian in the prepared remarks on trends in Middle East Africa  So maybe just help us understand how you re looking at the applied markets there and also just remind us of the scale of that piece today George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so I ll    Julian I ll give you the overview of EMEA LA  We ve made a tremendous amount of progress in EMEA LA over the last couple of years  not only in expanding our footprint from a sales  from a service standpoint  pretty much across the region  And when you look at our performance in the first quarter  organic growth 7   it was both install and service  HVAC   Controls up high single digit  Fire   Security up mid single digit  and Industrial Refrigeration  as Brian said to an easy compare  but up high teens  we ve made tremendous progress  And with that  we ve seen good leverage on the margin rate with the volume  Good productivity savings and cost synergies and so overall  we are executing extremely well  Even within the current environment  we re seeing a pipeline continue to expand and we re converting orders kind of mid single digit  with the backlog up 8   So overall we ve done    over the last couple of years of restructuring as Brian talked about  the work we ve done from a go to market is really beginning to play out Now that all being said in the Middle East  certainly part of that it does represent about 10  or 12  of the overall EMEA LA revenue  Last year was a tough year  2019 was a tough year for us  but we re beginning to see obviously with easier comps the work that we re doing around service and seeing some of the project installations come back  but    overall  I d say  when you look at the whole region  we made a lot of    lot of good progress in the last couple of years and competitively I think we re positioned in an extremely strong    strong position  I don t know Brian  you want to    Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think you summarized it well  I think we had a pretty easy comp in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal  19 and so that benefited certainly in the current year  but I think we re better positioned today than we were a year ago for sure Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThanks  And then my second question just around corporate cost  heard the color on second quarter versus first quarter  but for the year as a whole  maybe just highlight the confidence in that range for corporate cost that you ve given on Slide 21  particularly in light of a very good performance in Q1  And also where do we stand today in terms of realized stranded cost reduction since the Power divestment and how much stranded cost is still left to come out from that and whether that view has changed in the past nine months Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerSo our corporate expense guide for the year is  330 million to  340 million and we ended up at  81 million in the first quarter  That tends to be a lower quarter for us  And so I think there is going to be a tick up in the second and third quarter  So I think that guide of  330 million to  340 million is still a pretty good number  may be on the lower end of that  but I think that s probably a good number to use for now As it relates to the Power Solutions stranded cost takeout  I think we had communicated that we were going to have about a  10 million benefit that we saw in  19  it was going to be about  30 million in 2020  And then the full run rate  50 million benefit  we would see in  21 forward  We saw probably about what you would expect a pro rata portion of that  30 million here in the first quarter and we would expect that  30 million to be delivered throughout the course of the year Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi  Sir  your line is open Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystGood morning  guys Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerGood morning Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystGeorge or Brian  obviously is nice to see the tax helping your GAAP cash  but adjusted cash maybe slightly better than your normal seasonal weakness  When you look at 2020  the issues that we re going to give cash conversion down to 95  such as equity income from your JVs versus dividend and pension  do you see more improvement in trade working capital versus your expectation that can help you in 2020  And how you are thinking about ability to collect dividends from your JVs in 2020 Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerSo the trade working capital as a percentage of sales  as I mentioned did improve by 60 basis points quarter over quarter  We saw a day improvement in DSO  day improvement in DPO  we saw a five day improvement in days on hand in the inventory side  So all in all  we made progress  really across the three key metrics  As we look at the 95  for the year  that type of improvement was contemplated when we gave the 95  guidance  I would tell you that as you know  this is the first year that we are going to end up in the situation where we ve got reported cash flow in excess of adjusted cash flow because of that  600 million tax refund we got in the first quarter We still tend to be a little bit short of 100  converted because of the level of our capex  the fact that we don t get the entire amount of our equity income out in terms of dividends from our    from our JVs and then we still have this pension income that doesn t come with any cash  Now that s offset with some amortization benefits  So I think longer term  we re going to get to that 100  level  But sitting here today  the headwinds are still a little bit more than the tailwinds we ve got  So our target is 100   but I think 95  is a good number for this year Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystThanks for that Brian  And then George  can you give us more color into the inventory destock situation that you had last quarter in Japan and Taiwan  Resi HVAC was still down in Q1 there  but it wasn t    it didn t seem embedded last quarter  I know you talked about the headwinds in North America impacting Q2  but do you still see APAC situation not being a headwind as we go into Q2 George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo specially on the unitary commercial is that what you asked  Andrew Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystYeah  And because you said Japan might sort of be an overhang as you go through at least in the Q1  it looks like that may be getting a little better  but just your comment on Japan and Taiwan as we sit here over the next couple of quarters George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so when you look at the    we talked a little bit about the softness we had in our furnace business  which the market itself was down about 9   We have a strong presence in that market and certainly that hit us  And then Brian had talked a little bit about the restructuring that we re doing in our Canadian distribution with short term  we did see a little bit of a headwind  I think as we get through this first and second quarter  that s going to turn into a tailwind on a go forward basis  And we re going to significantly increase our points of distribution And so you see a little bit where you got a lot of different factors playing    playing together here  We think that Q2 will continue to be a little bit soft  but as we get through the year  we re going to be positioned to get back to above market growth within the    within our business  So does that get at what you    Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerAnd Andy  just specifically related to Taiwan and Japan  as we said last quarter  we expected the destocking to be complete in Taiwan  in Q4 and it was  So our Taiwan business was fine  On the APAC side and as expected  we did continue to have some pressure in Japan in our APAC residential business  We do expect that to start flattening out as we get into the second quarter Andrew Kaplowitz    Citi Research    AnalystThat s helpful guys  thank you OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen  Your line is open sir Gautam Khanna    Cowen   Co    AnalystYeah  thanks  good morning guys  Couple of questions  First  I was wondering George  could you comment on the M A pipeline  I know you talked about  1 billion sort of set aside for potential acquisitions  where do we stand there George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we re    we re constantly looking at bolt ons  Gautam  we re continuing to reinvest organically  We ve got a pipeline across our businesses where we have gaps  technology or products looking at bolt ons  So at this stage there s nothing  nothing significant  but we are continuing to strengthen our regional footprint and continuing to look at our product portfolio to make sure that we re making the appropriate plays in line with the organic investments we re making Gautam Khanna    Cowen   Co    AnalystOkay  And just    as you look at the portfolio  do you see any incremental potential for divestments as we move forward George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe ve been continuing to review the portfolio across the board  And we ve been making small divestitures with businesses that are non core and businesses that we don t want to continue to reinvest in  but again there has been nothing significant there  But that s a process that we continue  we re constantly looking at the portfolio  Gautam Brian J  Stief    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerGautam  I would just say to that I think when you look at the activity in the current year you know  we ve got our  Indecipherable  business as held for sale  Right now  we would expect that to close in the current year  And there are some other investments that will probably make  but I think you can almost look at our M A activity in the current year that the inflows and the outflows will be relatively the same  I don t think there s going to be anything significant in fiscal  20 Gautam Khanna    Cowen   Co    AnalystThat s helpful Brian  One last one for me  just    as we look at the fiscal  21  what do you think the lingering integration  Indecipherable  George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLet me    let me just frame  21  We gave a framework that when we gave guidance for  20 and what that ultimately would look like in 2021 as it relates to the deployment of capital with the buybacks and the like  In addition to that  I m very confident that when you look at the fundamentals of what we re building across these businesses from a margin standpoint  on a go forward basis that we re going to be positioned  we have a pipeline of productivity and savings that ultimately is going to position us to sustain margin improvement year on year  similar to what we ve seen here over the last couple of years  So I want everyone to understand that  that s going to continue Now with that there is some restructuring as it relates to some of the take out of    some of the structure that we have in place across the globe  And normally that would probably be in the 50    maybe the 50 million  maybe a little bit more range on an annual basis  but with very strong payback within the year relative to the margin rate that we can    we can achieve  So I feel very confident that with the    the framework that we provided relative to the buybacks and how that s going to play out as we position for 2021 the work that we ve done in reducing the debt cost and then now with the margin rates that we re achieving  that we re going to be positioned to deliver what I would say is incrementals that are 30 plus on our incrementals  And so that will position us extremely well to continue margin expansion and be able to deliver longer term on the margin rate that we originally said we could get to which is somewhere 15  to 16  Gautam Khanna    Cowen   Co    AnalystThank you very much guys Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerThanks Gautam OperatorThank you for your question  Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer  Your line is open sir Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer    AnalystThanks  good morning  If we could look at North America  we re seeing some improving indicators  both indicators ABI  Dodge Momentum  can you maybe just talk about the pace of quoting activity on the longer cycle project business  And what kind of confidence that gives you in sustainability of growing the backlog George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhen you look at North America and if you look at the quarter  organic growth was 3   a mix pretty much across all of the domains capabilities  margins were flat  But overall the margin rate we did operationally deliver not only with the volume and the productivity 40 basis points  but that was offset with the    with the retail mix and some of the cost pressure there When you look at orders  we did talk about the order down 1   A lot of that was timed because of the price increases  but when you look at the backlog  backlog was    backlog year on year was up 7  to  5 8 billion  So when you look at the mix of that backlog that is both short and long term projects  And as we project the year  we are positioned here for kind of mid    low to mid single digit top line growth  We are positioned here to continue to deliver orders that are kind of mid single digit  low to mid for the year  mid single digits in the second quarter  And then within the mix of those orders we ll be positioned to be able to convert those orders  Similar to what we re doing this year as we position for 2021  So the cadence that we have and how we look at backlog  how we look at turn  absolutely supports what we re going to achieve for this year and as we build the backlog as we plan for 2021  we feel confident that with the pipeline that we re currently working to convert that will position us well for 2021 Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and Communications OfficerAnd operator  with that I m going to pass it over to George for some closing comments George R  Oliver    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  thanks everyone for joining our call this morning  Again as we discussed  we re off to a strong start for the year  positioned well to deliver on our full year commitments  As it relates to orders  I feel very confident in mid single digit order growth in Q2  which then tied to the overall guidance of low to mid single digit growth for the full year  And with all of the sessions that are coming up  I do look forward to seeing many of you soon So on that Operator  that concludes our call Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  59 minutesCall participants Antonella Franzen    Vice President and Chief Investor Relations and

181771,403287,JCI,High tech dashboards signal big changes for auto parts suppliers,news,"By Alexandria Sage SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Peer at the instrument panel on your new car and you may find sleek digital gauges and multicolored screens  But a glimpse behind the dashboard could reveal what U S  auto supplier  Visteon  Corp  N VC  found  a mess  As automotive cockpits become crammed with ever more digital features such as navigation and entertainment systems  the electronics holding it all together have become a rat s nest of components made by different parts makers  Now the race is on to clean up the clutter   Visteon is among a slew of suppliers aiming to make dashboard innards simpler  cheaper and lighter as the industry accelerates toward a so called virtual cockpit   an all digital dashboard that will help usher in the era of self driving cars  What s at stake is a piece of the  37 billion cockpit electronics market  estimated by research firm IHS Market to nearly double to  62 billion by 2022  Accounting firm PwC estimates that electronics could account for up to 20 percent of a car s value in the next two years  up from 13 percent in 2015  Meanwhile  the number of suppliers for those components is likely to dwindle as automakers look to work with fewer companies capable of doing more  according to Mark Boyadjis  principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit   The complexity of engineering ten different systems from ten different suppliers is no longer something an automaker wants to do   Boyadjis said  He estimates manufacturers eventually will work with two to three cockpit suppliers for each model  down from six to 10 today  DIGITAL MAKEOVER  One of Visteon s solutions is a computer module dubbed  SmartCore   This cockpit domain controller operates a vehicle s instrument cluster  infotainment system and other features  all on the same tiny piece of silicon   So far this year  the Detroit based company has landed two big contracts for undisclosed sums  One  announced in April  is with China s second largest automaker  Dongfeng Motor Corp  The other is with Mercedes Benz  DE DAIGn   Reuters has learned  Mercedes did not respond to requests for comment  Another unnamed European automaker plans to use the system in 2018  according to Visteon   Visteon is going all in on cockpit electronics  having shed its remaining automotive climate and interiors businesses in 2016  The bet so far is paying off  The company secured  1 5 billion in new business in the first quarter  helped by growth in China  Visteon s stock price is up more than 50 percent over the past year   It s a major turnaround since Visteon was spun off from  Ford Motor Co   N F  a decade ago  Visteon filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 before emerging a year later    You have to be changing and adapting fast  If not  you re not going to keep up in this market   said Tim Yerdon  Visteon s head of global marketing   It s about reinventing yourself to stay ahead   DASHBOARD DEALS Visteon s makeover hints at the coming battle between suppliers fighting for real estate in the digital cockpit  The trend is already triggering acquisitions  as companies look to boost their offerings to automakers  Visteon in 2014 bought Johnson Controls   N JCI  electronics business  which was also developing a domain controller  In March  Samsung  KS 005930  completed its  8 billion purchase of infotainment company Harman  France s  Faurecia   PA EPED   a top seating and interiors supplier  last year purchased a 20 percent stake in Paris based infotainment firm Parrot Automotive SAS in a deal that could make Faurecia the biggest shareholder by 2019  Deal making in the wider automotive sector has been at a fever pitch over the past two years fueled by the race to develop autonomous vehicle technology  Activity in the sector was worth  41 billion in 2016  according to PwC   Analysts say German automakers are taking the lead in consolidating functions within the dashboard  Audi  DE NSUG  was the first to debut a virtual cockpit last year that combined its instrument cluster and infotainment system  CHEAPER  LIGHTER  SMARTER Streamlined dashboards can lead to cost reductions for manufacturers  who can save as much as  175 per car with an integrated cockpit  according to Munich based management consulting firm Roland Berger   They can also help with fuel efficiency  That s because vehicles are lighter when there are fewer behind the scenes computers  known as electronic control units  ECUs   Vehicles today contain 80 to 120 ECUs  numbers expected to fall sharply in coming years  But perhaps the biggest motivation for fancy cockpits is sales  Drivers accustomed to the seamless technology of their smartphones are finding today s dashboard offerings clunky and non intuitive  A J D  Power study released this month found the most complaints from new vehicle owners stemmed from audio  communications  entertainment and maps systems   Better cockpits could prove crucial to attracting younger consumers  who are not showing the same enthusiasm for cars  or even driving  that their parents did  Research company Mintel found that 41 percent of millennial car buyers are interested in having the latest technology in their vehicles   Disjointed dashboards  are one of the most noticeable gaps in user experience   what you see right in front of you   said Andrew Hart of UK based consultancy SBD Automotive  On many car models  he said  audible warning systems to alert the driver to a potential collision are not in sync with the radio  meaning your favorite song could drown out the warning beep    That s a crazy example of something when you don t consolidate ECUs   Hart said  Industry watchers say this and other safe driving features are among the systems ripe for integration  Additional targets include rear seat entertainment systems and so called heads up displays that project data such as the car s speed onto the windshield for easy viewing  Back in Detroit  Visteon says it is in talks with carmakers in China and Europe for its domain controller  a technology it hopes can give it an edge over rivals such as Delphi  N DLPH   Robert Bosch  ROBG UL   Continental  DE CONG   and Denso  T 6902   While it isn t clear who will prevail  electronics suppliers are seeing their products take on new importance as vehicles become more connected   
Five years ago  the dashboard was  a plastic molded cockpit that we stuffed electronics into   said Yerdon  Visteon s marketing chief   Now it s more about an electronic architecture that s experience driven  and we mold plastic around it  ",2017-06-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/high-tech-dashboards-signal-big-changes-for-auto-parts-suppliers-500385,500385

181853,403369,JCI,Corporate reports signal stronger US commercial building recovery,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf  Reuters    Rising orders and increasing optimism from companies like United Technologies Corp  N UTX  and Tyco International  N TYC  point to a strengthening recovery in the U S  commercial construction market  which has been limping back since bottoming more than three years ago 
The anecdotal evidence  buttressed by a strengthening index of architectural billings that is considered a leading indicator of commercial construction spending  bodes well for a variety of manufacturers whose fortunes are linked to construction spending for everything from hotels and offices to hospitals and schools  which remain far off their peaks from about six years ago 
 Everything that I m seeing and hearing is that the commercial construction portion of the business is improving   said Mig Dobre  an analyst with Robert W  Baird 
If the rebound is confirmed and sustained  it could be another strong sign that the U S  economic recovery is entering a more mature phase  Just this week the Federal Reserve gave a more positive assessment of the economy 
Non residential construction makes up roughly 60 percent of the nearly  1 trillion in U S  construction spending 
JP Morgan industrial analyst Stephen Tusa said the second quarter company reports suggest a recovery for non residential construction  though he cautioned that it is  choppy and uneven   Tusa estimates that about 15 percent of revenue from the diverse large cap manufacturers he covers comes directly or indirectly from non residential construction 
Jeffrey Hammond  an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets  also voiced qualified optimism   No one is shouting from the rooftop that it s robust  but all the directional indicators     are supportive   he said 
Spurred by his belief in a nonresidential construction rebound  Hammond in June upgraded shares of climate control system manufacturer Lennox International Inc  N LII  and Watts Water Technologies  N WTS   which sells products used for plumbing and water quality 
 UPS AND DOWNS 
Together with strong recent jobs data  a construction rebound could help justify recent lofty valuations for U S  equities  which took a hit on Thursday when they posted their worst daily decline since April 
As tracked by the U S  census  non residential construction spending on buildings  which tends to be one of the later markets to recover in an economic cycle  peaked in mid 2008  It hit bottom in January 2011 and has climbed back only 16 percent since then 
 We re pretty well into a commercial construction recovery  although it has had more than its share of ups and downs   said Kermit Baker  chief economist with the American Institute of Architects   The signs are it s going to begin to firm going forward  
Baker s organization oversees the Architecture Billings Index  which reflects a roughly 12 month lead time between architecture billings and construction spending  The index strengthened to 53 5 in June from 52 6 in May  Anything over 50 indicates an increase in billings 
Non residential building spending is seen picking up 4 9 percent this year and growing another 8 percent in 2015  according to a separate survey by the architecture institute released this week 
 SOME GOOD NEWS 
Leading the way is construction of hotels and office buildings  expected to be up 14 5 percent and 12 8 percent  respectively  this year  Conversely  government spending on public institutions  such as schools and hospitals  has been slow 
 The key to the forecast is that commercial construction continues to grow but that the public sector ceases to be a drag  and even adds some growth in its own right   said Scott Hazelton  managing director of construction industry consulting for research firm IHS 
In a positive sign  Johnson Controls Inc  N JCI   which makes climate control and other systems for commercial buildings  noted some cautious optimism about institutional projects in its recent quarterly report 
 I don t want to say the market is back  I m just saying that we are starting to see some good news  which I haven t seen in the past   the company s chief executive officer  Alex Molinari  told analysts 
Also in the second quarter  United Technologies reported a 44 percent leap in North American orders in its Otis elevators business and called the commercial construction outlook  encouraging   Tyco  which sells security and fire protection systems for commercial buildings  said orders for installations increased 9 percent in North America 
USG Corp  N USG   which sells building materials to construction companies  said steel sales through its distribution division rose 11 percent from the first quarter  an important leading indicator because steel is shipped early in a construction job 

 We re seeing some slight green shoots in our business on the commercial segment   USG s chief executive  Jim Metcalf  said on his company s conference call this quarter

181854,403370,JCI,Robots could restore  Made in Germany  label to Adidas shoes,news,"By Emma Thomasson HERZOGENAURACH  Germany  Reuters    German cobbler Adi Dassler revolutionized running when he started hammering spikes into track shoes almost a century ago  Today most of the 258 million pairs of shoes produced each year by his firm Adidas  XETRA ADSGN  are made in low cost Asia  That could soon change as cheaper  faster and more flexible robots mean manufacturing   including producing fiddly footwear   could be brought closer to consumers in high wage countries like Germany  speeding up delivery and slashing freight costs in what some call a fourth industrial revolution   Adidas is working with the German government  academics and robotics firms on new technologies it hopes will trigger a significant a shift in the footwear industry as the move led by its arch rival  Nike   NYSE NKE  to produce in Asia decades ago  The project is part of a broader drive by Adidas to catch up with Nike  which has extended its lead as the world s biggest sportswear firm in recent years with innovative products such as its  Flyknit  shoes made out of machine knitted fiber    We will bring production back to where the main markets are   Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer said in March   We will be the leader and the first mover there   Adidas hopes to be able to produce a custom made running shoe from scratch in a store in Berlin by next year  using a stitching machine and a foamer to make the sole   Nike  which has long faced criticism for using Asian sweat shops to produce its pricey footwear  is also investing heavily in new manufacturing methods  But it has not yet put a date on when it expects that to result in more U S  based production  JOBS AT RISK Key to moving footwear manufacturing closer to Western markets are technologies which cut the need for workers to piece together shoes  A machine can now  knit  an upper like a sock  robots can already complete more of the final assembly of the shoe  while 3 D printing could soon allow the production of a customized sole   That could threaten millions of jobs in the footwear industry in countries like China  Brazil and Vietnam  but potentially create new positions elsewhere  albeit for more highly skilled laborers working alongside robots  Robots  now used mainly in auto production  could soon cut labor costs by 18 percent or more by 2025 in other sectors  the Boston Consulting Group  BCG  predicts  The new technology is being closely guarded  photographers were not invited to an investor presentation at the Adidas innovation center  where it demonstrated a robot that could stick its trademark three stripes to a running shoe  Nike  for its part  tried to stop Adidas producing a knitted shoe that it said violated patents for the  Flyknit  technology it launched in 2012  However  a German court ultimately allowed Adidas to resume production of its  Primeknit  shoes  Nike says it can make  Flyknit  shoes with half the labor input of a typical  cut and sew  shoe as it has 80 percent fewer components  also resulting in 70 percent less waste as it no longer needs to cut pieces from a pattern and discard the rest  Nike co founder Philip Knight shook up the sporting goods industry that Adidas has dominated until the 1970s after putting into practice his thesis paper arguing that sneakers from lower cost Japan could compete with pricier German made versions  Today  Asia produces 87 percent of all footwear  with China by far the biggest manufacturer  followed by India  Brazil and Vietnam  according to APICCAPS  the association of Portuguese footwear manufacturers that compiles global industry figures  INCREASING SPEED TO BOOST MARGINS Nike and Adidas each rely on more than 1 million workers in contract factories worldwide to make their shoes  While the need for speed is one motivating factor  rising wage costs  particularly in China  are also driving the shift   That element is going up dramatically   said Glenn Bennett  head of global operations for Adidas who leads the project aimed at getting products to shoppers faster than the six weeks needed for shipments to arrive from Asia   Adidas is working with companies like automotive supplier  Johnson Controls   NYSE JCI   robotics experts Manz and knitting machine maker Stoll on new processes as it targets prototype in store manufacturing by next year  Adidas says more local manufacturing should leave it with less surplus stock it has to discount  helping to lift its operating margin above 10 percent from 6 6 percent in 2014  still behind the 13 percent Nike recorded last year  Nike  which saw sales in North America dampened earlier this year by delays to deliveries from Asia due to labor disruption at ports on the U S  West Coast  is unlikely to allow its German rival to get much of a headstart on localized production  During a visit by U S  President Barack Obama to Nike headquarters last month  the firm promised to create 10 000 jobs in the United States in the next decade by producing more in its home market if a trade deal with Asian countries is approved   We are putting a lot of money and a lot of resources against how our supply chain evolves to increase speed and make sure we deliver to consumers as quickly and innovatively as we can   Trevor Edwards  Nike brand president  said in March  Beyond knitting and 3 D printing  other innovations helping to speed up production include bonding and gluing technologies to fuse together fabrics as well as waterless dyeing which allows pigments to penetrate textiles more quickly  Yves Simon Gloy  an expert from the Institute for Textile Technology at Aachen University who is collaborating with Adidas and sees the dawning of a fourth industrial revolution due to the emergence of  cyber physical systems   machines equipped with sensors  cameras and motors that can be adjusted using the Internet in real time  But Bennett and Gloy do not expect these smart machines to completely usurp human workers   
 The breakthrough will probably happen in finishing the product close to the consumer   said Bennett   Not moving the whole of the operation  ",2015-06-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/robots-could-restore-'made-in-germany'-label-to-adidas-shoes-345929,345929

World  It is currently undergoing a  500 million renovation 
including  100 million to go  green  
 Anthony Malkin  president of W M Properties  which owns the
building  said the technology was devised as a model to
retrofit other buildings 
 The program carries an initial cost up to  20 million for
the first five stages of a  100 million project to make the
skyscraper  once the tallest in the world  a model of energy
efficiency and conservation  The Clinton Climate Initiative 
founded by former President Bill Clinton  which works with
cities on programs to cut greenhouse gas emissions  is a
project adviser 
 The entire plan will cut energy consumption in the
102 story building by 38 percent 
 The first five stages are expected to take about 18 months
to complete and will account for about 54 percent of Malkin s
total energy reduction goal 
 Many new buildings  such as 1 Bryant Park in Manhattan 
have built in technology to make them energy efficient  But
nearly 75 percent of the 4 64 million buildings in the United
States are over 20 years old  according to U S  Department of
Energy  and were not built to conserve energy 
 Commercial buildings are responsible for 79 percent of all
carbon emissions in New York City 
 The plan that will turn the Empire State Building  green 
was devised by energy services company Johnson Controls Inc 
project manager Jones Lang LaSalle Inc  the Clinton Climate
Initiative and the Rocky Mountain Institute  which evaluates
energy policy and initiatives 
 The group avoided the parameters for Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design  LEED  certification  a voluntary
national rating system of sustainable buildings  so it would
not be restrained  Malkin said  However  the finished project
will qualify the building for a LEED gold rating 
 Plans for the building include 
   On site upgrades of its 6 500 windows 
   New air conditioning and heating systems that adjust to
demand and also generate cool water 
   Insulating the space between radiators and the outside of
the building to trap heat and cold air 
   Installing energy efficient lighting that can be set to
light hallways and common areas only when they are occupied 
   Upgrading the existing building control system to provide
more details about demand and use of its systems 
   Introducing an Internet based system for tenants to
monitor their energy use and show them how to conserve

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Johnson Controls has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Brady has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that JCI s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
JCI currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 12  while BRC has a forward P E of 21 40  We also note that JCI has a PEG ratio of 1 67  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  BRC currently has a PEG ratio of 2 85 
Another notable valuation metric for JCI is its P B ratio of 1 57  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BRC has a P B of 3 45 
These metrics  and several others  help JCI earn a Value grade of B  while BRC has been given a Value grade of C 
JCI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that JCI is likely the superior value option right now ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jci-or-brc-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200498995,200498995

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This diversified technology and industrial company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  46 2  
Revenues are expected to be  5 55 billion  up 1 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 42  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson Controls 
For Johnson Controls  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson Controls will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Johnson Controls would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  2 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

	We re used to President Trump saying encouraging things about a deal  when he s not talking tough or putting on new tariffs   but today China s commerce ministry came out against further escalation 
	The spokesman also said the two sides were talking about a possible meeting next month 
	The market loved it  All three of the major indices jumped by well over 1  on Thursday for their third day of gains in the past four 
	The NASDAQ advanced 1 48   or about 116 points  to 7973 39  while the S P rose 1 27  to 2924 58  The Dow surged 1 25   or 326 points  to 26 362 25 
	The most welcomed comment from the spokesman  though  was that China might not retaliate against the latest round of U S  tariffs that are scheduled for Sunday 
	So here we go again  Stocks head into Friday s session with a fantastic opportunity to end its skid of four straight weekly losses 
	It s the same situation as last week  Only this time  the major indices are each up by well over 2  through Thursday  instead of just 1  
	Last Friday s session ruined that week s positive momentum as China retaliated with new tariffs on  75 billion worth of U S  goods  which led to an increase in tariff rates on Chinese imports after the bell 
	Of course  the most memorable event last Friday was probably President Trump s tweet that ordered U S  companies to look for alternatives to China

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Johnson Controls has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Axon Enterprise has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   This means that JCI s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
JCI currently has a forward P E ratio of 21 87  while AAXN has a forward P E of 62 69  We also note that JCI has a PEG ratio of 2 26  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  AAXN currently has a PEG ratio of 4 18 
Another notable valuation metric for JCI is its P B ratio of 1 58  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  AAXN has a P B of 7 27 
Based on these metrics and many more  JCI holds a Value grade of B  while AAXN has a Value grade of F

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits

Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
JCI currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 25  while AAXN has a forward P E of 68 91  We also note that JCI has a PEG ratio of 2 10  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AAXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 76

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This diversified technology and industrial company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  43 4  
Revenues are expected to be  5 79 billion  down 22 5  from the year ago quarter

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson Controls 
For Johnson Controls  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson Controls will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Johnson Controls would post earnings of  0 24 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 26  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

182048,403564,JCI,JCI Vs  ALLE  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Security and Safety Services sector might want to consider either Johnson Controls  NYSE JCI  or Allegion  ALLE   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Johnson Controls has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Allegion has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that JCI s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
JCI currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 47  while ALLE has a forward P E of 18 33  We also note that JCI has a PEG ratio of 1 13  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  ALLE currently has a PEG ratio of 1 43 
Another notable valuation metric for JCI is its P B ratio of 1 48  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ALLE has a P B of 16 90 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to JCI s Value grade of B and ALLE s Value grade of D

financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   NYSE        Morgan Stanley  NYSE    NYSE MS        Aetna  NYSE    NYSE AET        Johnson Controls International  NYSE    NYSE JCI       and LyondellBasell Industries  NYSE    NYSE LYB       Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Top Analyst Reports for Royal Dutch Shell  Morgan Staney and AetnaThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE        Morgan Stanley  NYSE       and Aetna  NYSE        These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today You can see Royal Dutch Shell shares are up  12 6  so far in 2017 vs  the  1 8  gain for the Zacks Integrated Oil industry  The integrated behemoth s upstream unit have benefited from the steady oil recovery  while production contribution of BG assets continues to be strong The supermajor has also been able to reduce operating costs and progress on its large divestment program  Importantly  the company generated a surge in cash flows during the most recent quarter  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend However  with oil unable to stay above the psychologically critical  50 threshold for more than a few days  Shell s near to medium term revenue outlook remains cloudy  The Zacks analyst is also apprehensive that the group s disposal program could affect production  which fell 11  sequentially in second quarter  Hence  the analyst advises investors to wait for a better entry point before buying shares in Europe s largest oil company  You can   Morgan Stanley s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Bank industry  over the last six months   20 8  vs   16 4    The performance was supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters The company s efforts to offload its non core assets to lower balance sheet risk and cost saving initiatives  Project Streamline  will likely lead to improvement in profitability  However  continued fall in corporate loan balances remains a near term concern  This is significantly hurting the company s interest income growth  You can   Buy rated Aetna s shares outperformed the Zacks Health Maintenance Organization industry year to date  increasing  26  vs  a gain of  24 7   The Zacks analyst expects the company to derive long term growth from its Government business  Cost reduction initiatives and growing ACO collaborations pave the way for long term growth A strong balance sheet is another positive  Its International expansion is also perceived as an opportunity in the face of increased regulation in the U S  Following strong second quarter results  Aetna rasied its earnings guidance which cements investors  confidence in the company  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 6 3  upward over the last 90 days Aetna has  however  been incurring losses in its public exchange business and has been exiting exchanges to avoid losses from this business  Furthermore  its membership growth remains under pressure  Increasing medical benefit ratios are also likely to hurt margins  You can   Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Johnson Controls International  NYSE       and LyondellBasell

Factors Influencing this Quarter
Johnson Controls expects earnings per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of  1 17  1 20  up from  1 07 recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  Revenues should benefit from an improvement in results in the Building Efficiency and Power Solutions segments as well as higher automotive production 
The company is focused on its comprehensive cost saving program along with improving productivity  In Sep 2015  Johnson Controls announced plans to reduce its workforce by 2 5  in the next two years to achieve annual cost savings of  250 million  Some of this benefit is expected to reflect in the quarter to be reported  Further  Johnson Controls is gaining strategic contracts which are aiding its business expansion  In Aug 2016  the company signed a  12 9 million technology contract with Methodist Healthcare  In Feb 2016  it signed a  15 million energy performance contract with Arkansas State University 
However  the divestiture of several businesses has been weighing on the company s revenues and profits  Further  negative foreign currency translation is affecting Johnson Controls  results  Revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 dropped 3 4  year over year due to deconsolidation of the company s automotive interiors business and foreign exchange headwinds  This trend may continue in the quarter to be reported 
Earnings Whispers

182258,403774,JCI,Stocks Rally On Lies  Fantasy  And Hope ,opinion,"What should we make of the rally in stocks  world stocks  metals  materials  oil  junk bonds  and everything else that could be counted as an asset in the third week of February  2016  Well  not much  When central banksters want a rally  we get a rally 
The stock rally can easily be explained through  calendar ization   This is a term that I coined a few years back so if you reuse it  send me some money  What it means is this  Every year  central bankers and their shills  Wall Street  bankers  financial media  goose asset prices in the fourth quarter so investors will get a pretty statement in January  Knowing that the next quarterly statement doesn t get printed until April  these same manipulators take off the better part of January to rest and restock their inkjet money printers  Naturally  asset prices swoon  Realizing that most investors get monthly statements as well  these manipulators go into panic mode and begin to goose asset prices to mute the damage of January  If the selling in January is too brutal  as was the case this year  2016   the manipulators hold off until February  Then we get a rerun of the same movie 
All is well  The economy is recovering  Unemployment is falling  People are getting raises  Retail sales are increasing  We are all the best looking duck in the pond  Whatever it takes  The manipulators plow into stocks at least by mid February so that investors don t get spooked by a double digit stock loss in the first two months of the year  If that were to happen  investors and consumers might elect to withdraw from playing in the carnival anymore  So magically  we get a February rally  Yawn  We have seen this before 
Gasoline prices have fallen  Therefore  consumer spending should increase  Huh  We hear this all the time from the Wall Street cheerleading society  Let s put a brain cell to work  If I have  100 dollars and gasoline costs me  20 dollars  I can spend the other  80 dollars on food  medicine  and clothes  If gasoline only cost me  10 dollars  I can spend  90 on that other stuff  However  the math does not change such that I can spend more  Regardless of what gasoline costs  I only have so much to spend in total  So  to think that lower gas prices leads to higher overall spending is mendaciously false 
Let s look at the rally s metamorphosis  1 25 16  McDonald s  N MCD  announces earnings  These are always fun  News articles written begin with the wonderful news that the burger chain was on the rebound with same store sales increasing for the first time in two years  After all  McDonald s is now a high priced Dow stock and manipulating the Dow higher means that McDonald s has to lead the charge regardless of truth  Earnings and sales both beat  analyst projections   Of course  writers these days always either omit the truth or wait until the end of the article  And there it is appearing as the last line in the article  Revenue for the company actually decreased by 3 5   When we need a rally  all news is good   
Oh  I m sure the rest of you have been worrying about this like I have but we can all rest easy now  JPMorgan  N JPM  announced that CEO Jamie Dimon received a nice salary increase this year  They managed to bump him up from  20 million a year to  27 million a year  Wow  That s a nice increase for a guy who ran his company into bankruptcy in 2008 only to be rescued by the Federal Reserve s pilfering of the US Treasury  JP Morgan was given back all the money that they lost gambling on derivatives  Mr  Dimon got to keep his job  now he gets a fabulous raise up to  27 million a year  and the US tax payers get to pay more and more taxes to pay for the now  20 trillion in debt the government has racked up saving companies like JP Morgan so people like Jamie Dimon can make  27 million a year  I m so happy for him  Who says the Federal Reserve Bank serves no purpose  And did any of the big banks lower any of the fees that they charge us for banking  Did any of them raise the interest rates that they pay us for our piddly savings accounts 
Johnson Controls  N JCI  is buying Tyco  N TYC  in another  tax inversion  deal  like Pfizer  N PFE    Johnson is a large US based company and Tyco is based in Ireland with half the capitalization of their buyer  The company will technically move headquarters to Ireland thus saving some  150 million per year in corporate taxes  Would you move to Ireland for  150 million per year 
Stocks are rallying  Consumers are spending more and tooth fairies are leaving us all money under our pillows regardless of any extracted teeth  Unemployment is near zero and we are all getting raises  Ain t it fabulous  Meanwhile  Walmart  N WMT  is closing 154 stores in the US and Macy s  N M  is closing 40  Oil producers are laying of tens of thousands but not to worry because they can all get jobs at america s fastest growing job producer   bartenders and waiters 
2 22 16  Stocks rallied  How many of the indices of the world were in the green  All of them  How many of the 30 Dow stocks were in the green  All of them  So today  everything in every part of the world was a buy  Nothing was sold  Yeah  sounds like a real  market  to me 
The Federal Reserve is busy buying every stock it can to drive up the Shanghai Composite stock index  Uh  I mean the PBOC is buying every stock it can to drive up the Dow  Wait  wait   it s the BOJ buying every stock in China  Hold on  Central bankers are all the same  It is so hard to tell the difference since formerly sovereign nations no longer control their sovereignty  Without central banker intervention on a daily basis in the capital markets  citizens would be free to realize price discovery on their own and Jamie Dimon would likely not be receiving a raise this year  Yes  while to White House purveyor of fantasy fiction purports positive economic statistics  we must understand the motive  These  statistics  are solely for the purpose of our psychological manipulation  This is nothing new  Please review the NAZI party in 1930s Germany 
While central bankers everywhere report improving economics  we must understand their statistics are just lies  The stories they tell us are simply fantasy  Economic growth is simply fantasy  Economic failure now lies at the foot of the economic keepers   the central banks  They are directing sovereign policy  They are directing data  banking  and psychology  Economic failure now would require a regime change  Central bankers would be exposed for the thieving frauds that they are  Is it far fetched to think that the same central bankers control stock indices  After all  the PBOC  the BOJ  and ECB all admit to buying stocks  The FRB does not admit to buying stocks because they know the American audience is still too stupid and has not yet caught on 
So  let s look at a few charts to see if we can recognize a pattern here 
Again  for the last three years  the Fed s stories about a  robust  Christmas shopping season turned out to be lies and the 4th quarter rally based on fantasy faded to a January selloff  Central bankers rested in January only to come to work in February with a fist full of money meant to rally equities  Take a look at the two month chart of 2014 below  January falls  February rises  
 DJIA Jan  and Feb  2014  Chart courtesy StockCharts com  Now take a look at the same two months of 2015  Same movie    DJIA Jan  and Feb  2015  Chart courtesy StockCharts com  Now take a look at the same two months of 2016  Same movie    DJIA Jan  and Feb  2016  Chart courtesy StockCharts com
So  kids  what have we learned 
One  stock prices always go up in the fourth quarter of the year  Lies  fantasy numbers  and the Fed will see to it  Yes  the stock carnival is rigged 
Two  stock prices always fall in January  The calendar dictates that when the Fed knows yearly statements are printed  they can take some time off from their busy schedule of manipulation 
Three  stock prices always go up in February because the Fed gets anxious about investors realizing that asset prices are in a bubble  Hope for an  improving  economy joins lies and fantasy to support the Fed rally attack 
The question now is what happens in March  This outcome is not so certain  One thing is certain  These serial manipulators hate negative quarterly statements so with indices still down for the year  March might again see a rally  Central bankers are not so much interested in a prolonged rally as much as they are the day to day manipulation of our psychology  Or  more accurately  the calendar ization of monthly investor statements is now the lone function of the most fraudulent  corrupt  mendacious  nefarious group on the planet   the central banksters  Bear market  What bear market  Stock index correction  What correction  Nothing to see here  See  indexes only went into  correction  territory for one day  And then  ssssccchhhwwwwiiiiing     Weeeeeee    Right back up we go  See  everything changes in a day  It is all in the calendar

182280,403796,JCI,Johnson Controls  Back To Consistency  ,opinion,"Johnson Controls Inc  NYSE JCI  traces its roots back to an interesting bit of history  One hundred and thirty one years ago  Warren Johnson was a professor in Whitewater  Wisconsin  It was here that he invented and installed the first electric tele thermoscope   known today as the thermostat   in his classrooms  The invention served a dual purpose  it kept his students more comfortable and put an end to the hourly interruptions from the janitor checking the rooms  temperature  Of course we can t confirm this  but it would be our guess that Professor Warren was a regular student favorite   
Shortly thereafter the Johnson Electric Service Company was launched in 1885  and in the coming decades the business brought evenly regulated temperatures to buildings around the world  Today the company is known as Johnson Controls and still has a hand in global temperature regulation  For instance  Johnson Controls   building efficiency  segment contributes roughly a third of Johnson Controls  sales by increasing energy efficiency for more than one million customers in the heating  ventilating and air conditioning areas  However  Johnson Controls has diversified greatly such that the roughly half of its business is now derived from the segment  automotive experience    with 240 worldwide plants  a global capability to supply more than 50 million cars per year and a focus on seating  instrument panels and interior electronics  Finally  roughly a seventh of the business is classified as  power solutions  where Johnson Controls supplies over a third of the world s lead acid batteries to major automakers 
If you put it all together  the corporation has grown from a single idea in the 1800 s to a  30 billion company with about 170 000 employees  1 300 worldwide locations and sales of  42 7 billion last year 
Perhaps equally impressive to the company s story is its record of consistently rewarding shareholders  Most to this point is Johnson Controls  dividend record  Johnson Controls has paid a dividend every single year since 1887   that s consistency in 3 different centuries mind you  More than that  the company also increased its dividend every single year from 1975 to 2008  Now  it is true that Johnson Controls had to freeze its payout during the Great Recession   which was due to the massive collapse of automakers during this time  However  since 2010 Johnson Controls has gone back to its roots by increasing the payouts by an average rate of 14  per year  In other words  one might be hard pressed to find other companies with such dividend consistency that are not on fellow Seeking Alpha Contributor David Fish s  CCC lists   
Furthermore  the company also announced a  3 billion increase in its share repurchase program which it intends to execute over the next few years  So the propensity to reward shareholders is quite high 
With that  let s take a look at the company s past operating history along with how analysts are presenting viewing this company through the fundamentals analyzer software tool of F A S T  Graphs    
We have already described the company s steady history  but here we can see that Johnson Controls had been a very consistent company up until the most recent recession   in fact  revenues had increased every year for 62 years until the financial crisis  Yet unlike other very consistent companies   for instance Wal Mart  WMT  or Johnson   Johnson  JNJ    whose profits barely noticed the recession  Johnson Controls  business rode the cyclical automotive wave and took it on the chin 
Earnings per share dropped from  2 27 in fiscal year 2008 to just  0 26 in 2009  Moreover  it took the company four more years to finally eclipse its previous EPS record mark  However  the long term picture is a bit more reassuring   Since 2001 earnings have grown by about 9  a year and since 1996 the number has been closer to 12  per annum 
 
When we look at the performance results  it s clear that the recession didn t permanently impair Johnson Controls  business  A hypothetical  10 000 investment at the end of 2000 would now be worth about  52 000  More than that  an investor would have received roughly  7 000 in dividend income as well   bringing the total annualized return up to 14 4   This compares to the S P 500 returning just 3 6  during the same time period  Furthermore  we think it s important to underscore the dividend per share column 
As discussed above  Johnson Controls was forced to freeze its dividend from 2008 to 2010  However  notice that this was a freeze rather than a cut  Despite the seemingly bad news for shareholders  a patient investor at the beginning of 2008 would still have seen their income increase by about 9  a year since then   despite 2 years of stagnation  Even great companies can run into short term problems  how they emerge is sometimes more important than how they got into the situation 
 
From a historical standpoint everything appears solid   despite the recession blues  But alas one cannot prudently make investment decisions by always looking through the rearview mirror  Thus it s paramount to also consider the company s prospects moving forward  One way to accomplish this is by viewing the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator provided by F A S T  Graphs  
Here we see that Johnson Controls is presently trading at a blended P E ratio of about 16  with a 1 9  dividend yield  More importantly  notice that analysts are projecting much higher EPS in the next couple of years along with a longer term growth rate of almost 15   If the estimates materialize as forecast   and Johnson Controls trades at a 15 P E multiple in the future   this would represent a roughly 16  annualized 5 year total return estimate including dividends   
 
When other sources are considered these estimates appear more than reasonable  However  this is certainly not to suggest that this is an absolute   the above is simply a calculator based on analysts  consensus estimates  The company could experience more hardship in the future and continue to be subject to the whims of the cyclical automotive market  More than that  any one of the company s 16  general  risks and 17  specific  risks listed in the firm s 10 K could materialize  For that matter  a risk outside of the 33 mentioned could formulate  It s important to remember that there is always risk involved in owning an equity investment 
Taken collectively  we have found that Johnson Controls has been a remarkably consistent company with a nice story spanning back to the 1800 s  It is true that the most recent recession caused Johnson Controls to temporarily stumble  but it appears the company has gotten its feet back under itself  In the future profits might be more cyclical than they had been  but we still find the underlying business prospects to be favorable  Today s valuation is slightly higher than it has been historically  yet it might be warranted if earnings materialize as forecast  As always  we recommend that the reader conduct his or her own thorough due diligence

182311,403827,JCI,Our Top 40 Favorite Dividend Champions  Blue Chip Dividend Growth Stocks,opinion,In part one of this two part series  Found Here  I laid the groundwork for why I believe that blue chip dividend paying US equities represent not only a viable  but also a safer investment choice than many give them credit for  I also pointed out why I believe the risk profile on bonds is currently upside down  arguing that for one of the few times in history they may actually be more dangerous an investment than equities This is not normal  and therefore  I believe requires looking at investment choices differently than we traditionally have  I once read a comment from the renowned spiritual leader Dr  Wayne Dyer that summarizes my point quite nicely   when you change the way you look at things the things you look at change   In today s investment environment I think we need to change the way we look at bonds and simultaneously change the way we look at equities  At least temporarily regarding bonds  until interest rates normalize  which I believe they eventually will  But perhaps we should change the way we look at equities more permanently    I believe a critical part of changing the way we look at equities is by the recognition that there are wide differences in the safety profile of various equity classes  For example  many highflying non dividend paying growth stocks tend to carry a lot more risk than more established dividend paying stalwarts  There are many reasons for this that goes beyond just the fact that the latter pays a dividend  On the other hand  the dividend itself is a great mitigator of risk  Maybe the best way to understand this is through a quote attributed to Will Rogers   I m not as concerned about the return on my money as I am the return of my money   Every time a company pays you a dividend  you are receiving a return of your money as well as on it  Therefore  with each dividend paid you technically have less money at risk    Additionally  the legendary investor Ben Graham shared his feelings on the safety of dividend paying stocks when he wrote in the value investor s Bible  The Intelligent Investor in Chapter 11  Security Analysis for the Lay Investor as follows     4  Dividend Record  One of the most persuasive test of high quality is an uninterrupted record of dividend payments going back over many years  We think that a record of continuous dividend payments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor in the company s quality rating  Indeed the defensive investor might be justified in limiting his purchases to those meeting this test     Of course it should go without saying  those companies on the prestigious Dividend Champions list of companies that have not only paid a dividend for 25 consecutive years  five more than Ben required   but also increased their dividend every year as well  goes beyond Ben Graham s definition of a quality company  And therefore  since a defensive investor is by definition one that is wary of taking risk  it would only seem logical that dividend paying equities  especially Dividend Champions  possess the safety characteristics they desire  at least according to Ben Graham and yours truly   to David Fish s list of dividend champions     My Top 20 Dividend Champions    Before I reveal my favorite Dividend Champions  a few more introductory remarks on this specific equity class  and equities in general  are in order  First and foremost  even though every stock in the prestigious Dividend Champions list shares the characteristic of 25 years of consecutive dividend increases  they are not all the same  In truth  the discerning investor will discover many differences among the characteristics between the individual companies  105 in total  and the overall group  But for purposes of this article  I will concentrate on two primary subsets within the group as I screen for my favorite 20  Then  I will create two top 10 lists for each subset based on the different characteristics that each subset possesses    The reason I am focusing on these two different classes of Dividend Champions is because they each provide characteristics that best serve the unique needs of dividend growth investors with different goals and objectives  One set will serve the dividend growth investor that is perhaps already retired and seeking maximum current income  while set number two might better serve the dividend growth investor that is near retirement but still has some time to accumulate assets before needing to harvest yield  Therefore  subset one will focus on yield with total return secondarily  and subset two will focus on total return with yield secondarily  Nevertheless  yield on cost  or what I prefer to call growth yield  will be an important attribute of both groups    Dividend Champions That Were Screened Out   Instead of providing a long list of metrics that I used to eliminate Dividend Champions  I thought it might be more efficient to illustrate it with pictures  I ve always felt that utilizing statistical representations from which to make investment decisions is fraught with error  Even though the statistics can be accurate  they can mislead you due to their lack of what I consider to be relevant details  For example  as most readers may know  the Dividend Champions list is comprised of 105 companies that share a vital data set  Each company on this prestigious list possesses a consecutive streak of at least 25 years of dividend increases    Therefore  on the surface  it would be easy to assume  based on this statistic  that each company on the Dividend Champions list has a consistent long term record of earnings results  This assumption is logical  because dividends are paid out of earnings  In other words  a consistent and long term consecutive streak of dividend increases implies steadiness  Here is where the phrase a picture is worth 1000 words really becomes apparent  The following three examples utilizing  are Dividend Champions that were rejected because of a significant lack of evenness with their operating results    Nacco Industries  NC   NACCO Industries  Inc  is an operating holding company with subsidiaries in the following principal industries  lift trucks  small appliances  specialty retail and mining  Old Republic International Corp  ORI  Chicago based Old Republic International Corporation is one of the nation s 50 largest publicly held insurance organizations  Its most recent financial statements reflect consolidated assets of approximately  16 16 billion and common shareholders  equity of  3 77 billion  or  14 74 per share  Its current stock market valuation is approximately  2 29 billion  or  8 82 per share Note  ORI announced a spinoff of subsidiary RFiG along with a leveraged buyout  Therefore  the future prospects of this company may be changing for the better giving it speculative appeal  Mercury General Corp  MCY  Mercury General  NYSE MCY  is the leading independent broker and agency writer of automobile insurance in California and has been one of the fastest growing automobile insurers in the nation  It is ranked as the third largest private passenger automobile insurer in California  with total assets over  4 billion  Mercury also writes automobile insurance in Arizona  Florida  Georgia  Illinois  Michigan  Nevada  New Jersey  New York  Oklahoma  Pennsylvania  Texas and Virginia  In addition to automobile insurance  Mercury writes other lines of insurance in various states  including mechanical breakdown and homeowners insurance  Performance and Dividends Impacted By Operating StressIt should be clear from the above graphs that the earnings records of these three Dividend Champions have been far from steady  consistent or reliable  Therefore  I cannot get comfortable in either recommending them or investing in them because I cannot get comfortable predicting what their future operating results may be  Furthermore  by examining the performance results associated with the above earnings and price correlated graphs illustrates a lot of uncertainty  A focus on the earnings growth rate column illustrates a lot of stress on each company s ability to keep their dividend streaks alive  Blue Circles  The Overvaluation RejectionOther reasons besides irregular earnings growth that caused a Dividend Champion to be rejected include one of my all time favorites  valuation  Or to be more precise   overvaluation  The following example  McCormick   Co   MKC   represents one of my favorite Dividend Champions based on a very consistent above average record of earnings growth that produced its impressive dividend streak  The only reason that this Dividend Champion was rejected was because of current overvaluation Top 20 Dividend Champions That Made The CutCurrently  there are 105 Dividend Champions  however  as I ve already pointed out  I do not feel that a company should be invested in just because of its dividend streak  There are many other considerations that I think are important  Anyone who s a regular reader of my work will know that current valuation is one of the most important to me  But I also covet an above average growth rate  both historically  and even more importantly  forecast to continue in the future  The consistency of the company s operating results  regardless of growth rate  is also important  And of course  there is the yield versus total return issue that many dividend growth investors enjoy debating about  There are others  but these are the essential ones to me The important point that I am iterating here is that not all equities are the same  and also not all Dividend Champions are the same  But most importantly  the differences between the individual companies can make all the difference in the world regarding whether or not they should be invested in  Sometimes  the differences are temporary  for example  an overvaluation situation that may one day correct itself  In other cases  a permanent deterioration of fundamentals may soon render a current Dividend Champion a dud  and end its streak of dividends Top 10 Dividend Champions For YieldThis first top 10 list is offered for dividend growth investors that are most focused on current yield  My primary consideration here was a minimum current dividend yield of 3   greater than the 30 year T bond   However  I also put a premium on consistency and safety based on the assumption that this investor may already be retired and living off the income of their dividend growth portfolio  Finally  each of these companies had to be fairly valued  and some I would even consider significantly undervalued  Therefore  this list is presented in order of highest dividend yields to lowest Top 10 Dividend Champions For Total ReturnMy next top 10 list focuses more on total return than current yield  I offer this list for the dividend growth investor that may still be in the accumulation phase  Although the primary emphasis here is on total return  how it will be accomplished can vary from one company to the next  In some cases  return is a function of above average expected earnings growth  In other situations very low valuation may be the generator of future return  Or perhaps return will be driven by a combination of both Many companies in this group can be identified by the highest estimated five year earnings growth rates  Others in this group can best be identified by the lowest PE ratios relative to estimated earnings growth  The remainder will be represented by some combination of the above factors Top 10 Dividend Champions Bonus ListIn addition to my top 10 favorite Dividend Champions for total return  and my top 10 Dividend Champions for yield  I will offer two additional lists of 10 each  One I will call my bonus list containing companies that could theoretically make either of the top two favorite lists  total return or yield  My second additional list I will call the honorable mention top 10  This list will contain an additional 10 Dividend Champions that were simply hard to exclude  In other words  although they did not make a favorites list  they each represent solid and attractive candidates that the dividend growth investor might want to consider Actually  there are several companies on these lists that qualified for either or both of my favorites lists  For example  Aflac  AFL  and or Emerson Electric  EMR  could easily be on both lists  My point is that I feel the reader should give the same consideration to each of these names as they would the two top 10 lists  To be clear  selecting the top 10 was difficult and therefore to a great extent subjective on my part  My method was to simply run a F A S T  Graphs  on each Dividend Champion with above average total return calculations  Then my lists were created by picking and choosing those companies that from my review looked best based on value  earnings and safety Top 10 Dividend Champions Honorable MentionThis final list of 10 Dividend Champions I have dubbed as honorable mention candidates  As I suggested with the bonus list  I feel this group also contains attractive candidates for the prudent dividend growth investor to consider  Summary and ConclusionsWhen I invest in stocks  I invest in the business not the market  Therefore  I intend to be a shareholder of the business for a very long time  Consequently  I am rarely too concerned about current market volatility because I focus more on the business behind the stock  It s important to remember that in truth you only get real information on the business four times a year  when the company s quarterly announcement is made  Exceptions would be major announcements such as acquisitions  mergers or some other material events that could permanently affect the viability of the business As a result  there are only three reasons that would prompt my desire to sell a fine business 1  If the valuation became too high thereby making the market risk too great to ignore  In this case I would sell and replace with another company offering better value 2  If I felt that there was a permanent fundamental deterioration in the business prospects of the company 3  If I came across an exceptional opportunity that was too good to pass over  then I might consider replacing what I perceived to be my current holding with the least potential with the new irresistible opportunity  it should be noted that this opportunity would have to be really extraordinary to cause me to consider such a move  What I feel I ve offered here is a list of 40 Dividend Champions that represent worthy candidates for consideration by the prudent dividend growth investor  Some of the names I offered for their yield  and others I offered for their total return potential  Although I believe that each of the candidates on the various lists represent Dividend Champions that are reasonably priced today  they are not necessarily all cheap  In other words  some are fully valued  some are attractively valued  and some are downright cheap  I leave it to the reader to conduct their own comprehensive due diligence on their own However  I do believe that these lists represent an efficient group of prescreened opportunities that are worthy of further consideration  There are other dividend candidates such as Johnson Controls  JCI  and Illinois Tool Works  ITW  that were covered in the previous article Part 1  that do not meet the standard of consecutive dividend increases  Accordingly  I do not consider this a comprehensive or complete list of all possible dividend growth opportunities  but I do consider them a great place to start looking  Finally  this article is also offered as a follow up to my previous article  Both of these articles and their lists of Dividend Champions are offered as candidates for long term ownership of the businesses behind the stocks  I have always held that long term is defined as at least a business cycle  3 5 Years Minimum   When I invest in a company  I buy earnings in a company today that I believe will grow into more earnings tomorrow  This is my expected source of greater dividends and capital appreciation from the capitalization of my greater earnings  Not from fickle Mr  Market behavior Disclosure   Long MKC  JCI  ITW
