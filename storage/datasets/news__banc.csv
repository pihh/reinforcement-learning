Prepared Remarks 
OperatorHello and welcome to Banc of California s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call  All participants will be in a listen only mode   Operator Instructions  After today s presentation  there

Today s presentation will also include non GAAP measures  The reconciliation for these and the additional required information is available in the earnings press release  The referred presentation is available on the Company s Investor Relations website Before we begin  we would like to direct everyone toward the Company s safe harbor statement on forward looking statements included in both the earnings release and the earnings presentation I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr  Jared Wolff  Banc of California s President and Chief Executive Officer Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning and welcome to Banc of California s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call  Joining me on today s call is Lynn Hopkins  Chief Financial Officer  who will talk in more detail about our quarterly results  and Mike Smith  Chief Accounting Officer and Director of Treasury  who will also be available during Q A 2019 was a terrific year for Banc of California and in the fourth quarter  we continued to make meaningful progress on our core initiatives  resulting in net income available to common stockholders of  10 4 million and diluted earnings per common share of  0 20 I ll talk some more about the highlights in a moment  but first I want to welcome Lynn to our first earnings call with Banc of California  Lynn joined us just last month and brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to our leadership team  As we have previously discussed  Lynn and I have known each other for nearly 20 years and we re closely together for over a decade  So I know how much value she brings to our organization  She shares my vision of how we are transforming Banc of California into a relationship focused community bank and I look forward to working alongside her as we continue executing on the business strategy  I ll turn the call over to her in a few minutes  However  I want to first talk about some of the business results and trends that set us up well for 2020 When I joined the bank three quarters ago and after careful analysis of the business  I gave our management team three initiatives to focus on in order to build short and long term value for the bank  First and foremost  we needed to reduce our cost of deposits  During the fourth quarter  our cost of deposits was 1 27   down significantly from the 1 67  we reported on my first earnings call  Through internal deposit incentive programs and a concentrated effort to remix our deposit portfolio  demand deposits made up almost 50  of our total deposits at year end with non interest bearing deposits comprising just over 20  of total deposits  up from 13  when the year began The second goal we set out to accomplish was lowering our quarterly expenses  Total non interest expenses for Q4 were  47 2 million  which when annualized would be a 17  improvement over the full year of 2018  As we continue to transform the balance sheet and invest in business initiatives aligned with our core objectives  our operating expenses may fluctuate  I expect our operating expenses are currently in the lower end of the range for the near term  However  we will remain diligent to ensure our expenses are at an appropriate level and we ll continue to look for efficiencies Finally  we targeted the asset side of our balance sheet  specifically  non core assets with the goal of remixing the balance sheet in order to optimize the Bank s earning power and lower our overall risk profile  During 2019  we lowered our securities portfolio from 19  of total assets at the start of the year to under 12  in Q4  and we significantly reduced balances of brokered multifamily and brokered single family loans by 33  and 31  respectively  Our balance sheet is now much stronger with total assets at  7 8 billion  Further  as a result of these efforts  our NIM expanded to 3 04  for the quarter As discussed when I joined the Bank  the purpose of these three goals was to create a foundation that would have a sustainable franchise value and set us up for future success  We believe that foundation has now been established  And while there is more work to do  in many ways we are a very different  more focused bank today than we were nine months ago A key area of focus for us in 2020 will be keeping our balance sheet at the right size as non relationship loans pay off and we originate new high quality relationship loans that result in changing the mix of our balance sheet  This is a process and our transition will continue through the year  but we are doing it from a base that is more representative of the bank we want to be In addition to adding Lynn to the team  we also welcomed Conan Barker and Andrew Thau to our Board of Directors during the fourth quarter  Conan and Andrew have deep roots within the Southern California business community  and I look forward to their valuable contributions in 2020 and beyond  With their addition  our Board is now comprised of 10 directors  nine of whom are independent  Staying on the topic of corporate governance  in December  we were pleased to be notified by the SEC staff that they have concluded the investigation opened in January of 2017 and that they do not intend on recommending an enforcement action against the Company to the Commission  As you know  I expressed the desire to move past as much of this as possible and we are excited to close that chapter and finish 2019 a much stronger Company than when the year began with a clear focus and stable foundation from which we intend to become a high performing relationship based bank I ll end my opening remarks by thanking our amazing colleagues at Banc of California for their tireless work this year  Our organization is filled with highly professional and capable team members dedicated to excellence and determined to ensure our clients receive the best possible service  It is through their significant efforts this year that we were able to successfully execute on all of our initiatives and are now poised to enter the new decade as stronger and more focused community bank Now  I d like to introduce Lynn Hopkins  who ll provide more color on our operational performance  Then I ll have some closing remarks before opening up the line for questions Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Jared  and thank you for the kind introduction  First  I d like to start off by saying how pleased I am with the teamwork and enthusiasm I have gotten to be a part of since starting with the Bank about six weeks ago  It s clear that team has been able to accelerate the Bank s transformation considerably over the past 10 months and I think that is a reflection of their exceptional commitment to the Company s vision as well as a high performance culture Jared has built in partnership with the executive team and throughout all levels of the organization  I m inspired to have joined such a great team and look forward to make it a meaningful contribution for the benefit of all of our key stakeholders Moving on to our quarterly results  Assets declined  797 million  resulting from a net decline in loan balances of  431 million  along with the decline in unsettled security sales of  335 million and a decline in cash of  153 million  These declines were offset by an increase of  137 million in securities  The Bank benefited from this decline by reducing reliance on wholesale funding During the quarter  in furtherance of our plans to create a more traditional securities portfolio  we sold the remaining  39 million of our longer duration agency mortgage backed securities and purchased  192 million of new securities  comprised of  126 million of agency commercial mortgage backed securities   53 million of municipal bonds and  14 million of corporate debt securities  At the end of the year  CLOs represented 79  of our securities portfolio  and we remain comfortable with the credit quality  We will opportunistically look to transition out of the CLOs to the extent we find other interest earning assets that provide an equivalent yield at the same or lower risk profile At the end of the fourth quarter  our overall securities portfolio has a lower duration and outside of our CLO balances  it s transitioning to a more distributed and traditional bank securities portfolio  representing 11 7  of total assets  We expect to complete the rebalancing of our securities portfolio in the first quarter and that securities will stay in the range of 10  to 15  of total assets going forward  We also saw a positive effect from changing the mix of our loans within our total portfolio as total commercial related loans represented 72 4  of our loans held for investment  up from 71 3  at the end of the prior quarter  The overall decline in loan balances was due mostly to accelerated payoffs in the brokered single family and multifamily portfolios  payoffs from a few large C I loans as we continued to timely manage our potential credit risks  and lower total warehouse loans  The decline in loans included reductions in most categories  including lower single family residential mortgage loans of  185 million  C I loans of  98 million  commercial real estate loans of  72 million  and multifamily of  69 million  The loan portfolio mix of brokered single family and multifamily loans is 52  at quarter end  which is consistent with prior quarter end  but down from 59  at the end of prior year and we expect these loans to represent a lower percentage of the total portfolio over time In addition  C I balances are 28  of our total held for investment portfolio and within our target range for C I loans of 25  to 30  of the overall portfolio  The new loan production totaled  182 million during the quarter at a weighted average rate of 4 82   The average production rate has come down  in line with the decrease in market interest rates generally  However  the fourth quarter average production rate is 11 basis points higher than the current average portfolio yield of 4 71   On the margin  we believe this will continue to be the case as the loans we re bringing in are more relationship based  which will then contribute to a better earnings profile and a stronger balance sheet in the long term  In the short term  the challenge  of course  will be to maintain our earning capacity as we rebuild the balance sheet against the backdrop of payoffs in the brokered portfolio Overall  the loan portfolio yield declined by 4 basis points quarter over quarter as we have originated and repriced our loans in the lower rate environment and as higher coupon commodity loans continued to be refinanced to other financial institutions  The fourth quarter loan yield does include 7 basis points due to a higher level of loan prepayment fees and accelerated discount from the repayment of purchased loans  However  the positive impact of higher prepayment fees was not enough to offset the impact of lower market interest rates Turning to deposits  Total deposits decreased by  343 million during the fourth quarter  driven mostly by controlled run off of higher costing deposits  including matured CDs that were not renewed and other non maturity accounts  Brokered CDs decreased  54 million to 0  higher costing savings decreased by  157 million  and non brokered CDs decreased  163 million  In addition  non interest bearing deposits declined  19 million  Phonetic   while interest checking increased  31 million  While spot balances were down for non interest bearing checking    average non interest bearing checking and interest checking increased  95 million for the quarter  Non interest bearing checking represented over 20  of our total deposits at year end  Overall  our efforts to place a higher priority on gathering lower costing relationship based deposits combined with the impact of lower market interest rates reduced our average deposit costs by 21 basis points to 1 27  from the prior quarter We reduced our reliance on wholesale funds  including lower FHLB advances during the quarter  We used the proceeds from our prior quarter asset sales to pay down the FHLB advances by  455 million or 28   We should continue to see the reliance on higher costing wholesale funds decrease in the coming quarters as our funding needs are expected to be achieved through our deposit initiatives Looking at the income statement  net income available to common stockholders for the quarter was  10 4 million or  0 20 per diluted common share  After adjusting for non core items  along with the amortization expense associated with our solar tax equity program  our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were  48 1 million  Normalizing our tax rate to 24   operating earnings from core operations were  0 18 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter  Reconciliations for this are located within today s earnings presentation  For 2020  we expect our tax rate to be in the 22  to 24  range Net interest income was  56 7 million in the fourth quarter  down  2 3 million from the prior quarter due to the impact of lower average earning assets  offset in part by a higher net interest margin  Average earning assets decreased  781 million and our net interest margin increased 18 basis points to 3 04   The net interest margin expansion is due mainly to a 20 basis point decline in our overall funding costs to 1 55   while the yield on interest earning assets remained flat at 4 50   The earning asset yield remained flat due to an improved asset mix  This higher yielding loans represented a higher percentage of our interest earning assets  combined with an increased yield on our securities portfolio and offset by a lower loan portfolio yield Non interest income was down by  6 4 million from the third quarter due to  478 million decrease in average portfolio balances  combined with the 4 basis point decline in average yield as previously described  Interest income on securities declined by  2 2 million on lower average balances  offset by a 12 basis point increase in the average yield to 3 72   The increase in the securities yield is due to the higher yielding CLO portfolio  representing a higher percentage of this earning asset class  offset by an overall lower yield on the CLO portfolio as the CLOs have reset lower based on three month LIBOR Fourth quarter interest expense from deposits decreased by  4 6 million due to lower average interest bearing deposits of  468 million and a 21 basis point decline in the average cost of such deposits  Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased by  2 1 million from the prior quarter due to a lower average balance of  313 million and a 4 basis point decline in the average cost of these funds  The overall average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by 18 basis points to 1 85   Average deposit balances decreased by  408 million  due to the decline in average interest bearing deposits  offset by a  60 million increase in average non interest bearing deposits  Average non interest bearing deposits represented 19 4  of total average deposits and this contributed to the lower total deposit costs and lower total funding cost as previously described Looking ahead to the first quarter  we have a good opportunity to continue this trend and maintain our net interest margin above 3   We will continue to focus on remixing our loan portfolio away from single family and into other high yielding loan types  which should help to offset the impact of the September and October market rate changes  In addition  with continued emphasis on relationship banking  we expect to improve both the mix and pricing of our funding base We recognized the reversal in our provision for loan losses during the quarter of  2 7 million due to the  431 million reduction in total loan balances  The allowance for loan loss coverage ratio of non performing loans is 133   while the overall allowance ratio to held for investment loans is 97 basis points Total non interest expenses for the quarter were  47 2 million and as I mentioned a few minutes ago  adjusting for non core expenses  fourth quarter core operating expenses were  48 1 million or 2 42  of average assets annualized  We expect on average our quarterly run rate expenses to remain below  50 million for the near term  However  as a reminder  there are historically more expenses built into the first quarter of the year  so we expect to see an uptick in expenses for Q1  Our capital position remains robust and above well capitalized  due mainly to a smaller asset base  Tangible common equity increased to 8 68   up from 6 34  one year ago Our Series D preferred stock is redeemable in June 2020 and we re currently evaluating various options for funding the redemption of our Series D preferred stock  In addition  the Company filed a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to provide the Company with flexibility and enable it to access the public capital markets to respond to financing and business opportunities that may arise in the future  The Company s prior Shelf Registration Statement expired in August 2019 Finally  I ll move on to credit and asset quality  Asset quality remained strong as total criticized and classified loans declined by  25 8 million in the quarter  Our non performing assets also decreased  1 8 million to  43 4 million as of year end  The decrease to non performing loans was due to the sale of a  11 9 million of non performing loans and  4 1 million returning to performing status  offset by  14 3 million of loans being placed on non accrual status  Our non performing loan balance includes two large loans that make up 54  of our total non performing loans  One is a  14 million shared national credit that went on non performing status in the third quarter and the other is a  9 million single family residential mortgage with a 38  loan to value ratio that went on non performing status in the fourth quarter  Aside from those two loans  non performing loans totaled  20 million and approximately 48  are single family loans  We believe the risk of loss on the single family portfolio is low and that we are appropriately reserved but due to consumer rules  single family loans tend to take longer to work through Non performing loans to total assets ratio was 55 basis points at the end of the year  up from 52 basis points at the end of the prior quarter  The increase was due to a decline in total loans relative to the decline in non performing loans  The total delinquent loans increased by  1 3 million to  57 6 million  resulting in a year end delinquent loans to total loans ratio of 97 basis points  The increase in delinquent loans to the linked quarters includes the addition of one  5 billion C I loan with a real estate developer that is expected to be worked out  Single family loans represent 75  of the total delinquent loans and the other segments reflect continuing positive results That will finish up my summary of the fourth quarter financials  So I ll go ahead and turn the call back over to Jared Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Lynn  2019 was a truly transformational year for Banc of California  We accelerated the transition of the Bank into a relationship focused business bank  We executed on meaningful capital management activities to unlock value within our balance sheet and to put excess capital into areas which better optimized our business  We are remixing our entire balance sheet to drive the earnings power of our franchise and we reduced our expenses to better fit our size and footprint  What you have now is a bank with a solid foundation upon which we can build a high performing relationship focused business bank for the long term We would not have been able to accomplish so much this past year if not for our talented Banc of California colleagues and their unyielding dedication to meeting and exceeding our clients  expectations  By providing superior service and solid solutions for our clients  we develop relationships built on trust and instill  Phonetic  confidence that our clients will have all of our resources at their disposal in our high touch service to meet their banking needs  Our focus on service is a hallmark of Banc of California and we look forward to serving even more business clients in the upcoming year We make sure that we listen to what our clients are telling us  Last quarter  I updated you about various technology initiatives we were working on and some of which resulted from feedback from our clients  We will constantly evaluate how we can improve our clients  experience and continue evolving our technologies to meet the increasingly integrated needs of our business clients Now that we ve successfully executed on our strategic initiatives for 2019  we are well positioned heading into 2020 to show improvements on both sides of the balance sheet  Our teams are focused on bringing in relationship loans and deposits and as a result  we expect to improve our mix of deposits as well as our overall costs  while maintaining our loan yield as much as possible  The loan remixing will also result from the normal course pay offs of brokered SFR and multifamily loans and we will redeploy that capital into lower duration  higher yielding  C I and bridge real estate loans As we ve stated before  over time  CRE loans  which are comprised of commercial real estate  multifamily  and construction balances should move closer to a range of 70  to 75  of our total loan portfolio  while C I loans make up the remaining 25  to 30   This will be due mostly to initiatives to grow our portfolio of relationship real estate loans and the incremental business it is expected to generate for the Bank Over the next few quarters  pure earnings might be a little more tempered as we build assets back up  However  we are building this Bank the right way for the long term and creating true franchise value in the process  As we head into 2020  we have several key objectives we are focusing on for the year  Cost of deposits  the mix of our loans and deposits  and our net interest margin are the areas where we expect to show progress throughout the year  Additionally  our key objectives for 2020 include the rollout of technology initiatives  as well as the further training and development of our colleagues to ensure our teams have the skills and strategies to succeed in this highly competitive market  We are in the midst of an exciting and rewarding multiyear transformation and I look forward to showing progress on these initiatives as much as we succeeded in 2019 Thank you for listening today and I look forward to updating everyone on our progress toward those initiatives during our next quarterly earnings call  With that  let s go ahead and open up the line for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  Ladies and gentlemen  we will now begin our question and answer session   Operator Instructions  The first question today comes from Matthew Clark of Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystHi  good morning Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Matt  How are you Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood  Maybe first question  just I m wondering what the spot rate was on your interest bearing deposits at the end of the year Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe spot rates    hi  Matt  this is Lynn  We did not disclose that in our materials quite yet  So we will be providing that subsequent to the disclosure Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe can tell what the averages were  So for    overall is 1 25   Phonetic  as you know  For CDs  it was 2 24   Phonetic  and there is a big bulk of CDs that are going to be repricing in the first quarter and so we expect to have the opportunity to reprice those down  Interest   Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd then   Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYep Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystThat s fine  Okay  And then just on the size of the balance sheet  it looks like it might be down a little bit further here in the first quarter  but I guess what are your thoughts on the size of the balance sheet from here and your net loan growth prospects Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It really depends on the payoffs  If the payoffs continue at the same pace that they did in the fourth quarter  I would expect for the year for our balance sheet to remain flat or perhaps a little bit larger  but not much  If payoffs reduce  then we should be able to show more growth through the year  There    the single family and multifamily loans that are on our books that are higher yields are repricing notwithstanding the prepayment penalty  That s how much of a delta there is with rates  And so  it s just    it s to be seen how much they re going to reprice Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just on capital    I mean  a smaller balance sheet your capital ratios jumped quite a bit this quarter and you comment in the release about opportunities to deploy it to optimize  franchise and improve earnings  Can you just talk more about what you mean there Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  obviously the balance sheet size coming down means we do have a lot of excess capital  So we did file the Shelf Registration Statement yesterday with the SEC  so that should give us options as we look forward to 2020  The preferred stocks  Indecipherable  is redeemable in June  So we re taking a look at that and then we re evaluating other options as well with the additional capital Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just any update on CECL and what the day one impact might be Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  I believe in the third quarter release  the 10 Q  we had given a range of about zero to 25   So  as the balance sheet has come down during the fourth quarter and we ve continued to run our models there  I think we have refined our range to be between 0 to 15  Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think it will be at the upper end of that range as of now  We re going to keep looking at it and we have till 03 31  Phonetic   but I think it s going to be    as of now  Matthew  it s feeling like it s the middle to upper end of that range Matthew Clark    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  Great  Thank you OperatorYour next question today comes from Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Timur  we can t hear you Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystI m sorry  Is this better Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYep  How are you Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystYeah  and how are you  Sorry about that Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystAm I correct in that you exited all of the brokered single family mortgages this quarter Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I mean  we still have a portfolio of brokered single family mortgages that s fairly substantial  There is a    we    they are truly brokered their non relationship base  We don t have much of a connection with the borrowers  And so we ceased that business originating those loans several quarters ago  And so  there are payoffs that are going to incur with that portfolio Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  So the business has been exited  Okay  And so  I guess  what s the balance of the brokered SFR and multifamily loans Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe don t    I don t think we break out the distinction between what s brokered and what s not in our financials  So we can tell you the size of the portfolios  but we don t break out what s brokered and what s not  It s kind of a mixed bag  I would look at the pace of payoffs in the last quarter and as of right now  we don t know that that s going to change and so we re originating new loans to replace those loans  And so we think the remix will improve our balance sheet  We ll have more    we re getting deposits with every loan that we bring in and I m pleased that we were able to hold our portfolio yield pretty well  And so  we re getting the leverage from reducing our deposit costs much faster than our loan yields are declining  But it s to be seen  I mean  it s just something we can t control and we just want to keep putting on really good loans Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And you had mentioned that there is a large chunk of CDs that are maturing in the first quarter  Can you quantify that number and what the expected cost benefit is if you to keep those on  Or is the expectation that they roll on Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  While we re looking for the exact number  what s our going rate right now for the CDs that we think Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThey are in the range of 1 50   Phonetic  to 1 75   Phonetic   And so  just specifically in the near term  for the first quarter  the CDs that are coming up are around  250 million and they have a weighted average rate right now around the 2 40   Phonetic  mark  So those we re repricing down into the current rate Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd our retention rate on those CDs is around 50   maybe a little bit higher  So we re not going to save all of them  Some of them are just    they re just going to shop with highest rate but our retention rates have gone from like 18  all the way up to 50  as we revised our model and figure out what we want to keep  We could keep all of it  it s just  I think we can do better than that and we re trying to get the most pricing leverage we can Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  And as that translates into broader funding costs  impressive move this quarter  Is the expectation that the pace of future funding cost declines kind of decelerates or as you guys look out at the funding schedule as this type of pace is going to be sustainable for at least the next couple of quarters Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think a lot of the low hanging fruit has been eliminated  I would be very pleased if this quarter we are able to match last quarter  I appreciate your comments and I agree with the healthy drop  It s really going to depend upon our pace of bringing in DDA  non interest bearing and low cost checking accounts  And I think that s our    we have a big opportunity that we have some chunky CDs and    but we have less than we used to  And so over time  the bigger impact is going to become    coming from the pace of new clients with new money coming in at low rates with business accounts and less from repricing our existing portfolio Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  And just one last one from me  looking at the gain on sale of loans category  any help you can provide there and how we should be thinking about that going forward  I know that line has kind of been all over the place recently  but any guidance there would be helpful Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think we have the opportunity to do that going forward  It s just going to depend on    we have a great multifamily engine  We have the opportunity to generate loans that we might not want to hold because of the low yield  but the market will give us benefit for it and we can have some gain on sale  And while we build up our other business lines and while the teams that we hired get stabilized and start building up their pipelines and generating growth  that may be a lever that we choose to pull  I don t believe that long term having a huge gain on sale line is true franchise enhancing  But I think we want to keep earnings up  we want to keep producing money for shareholders and so to the extent that that s a lever we chose to pull  we would look to do so Timur Braziler    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThe next question today comes from Luke Wooten of KBW  Please go ahead Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystHi  good morning  guys Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Luke Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystJust wanted to talk    I think you guys had given the CDs  you guys have a repricing  they re currently at a 2 40   Phonetic  and you were saying    you guys are    current offering rate is 1 50   Phonetic  to 1 75   Phonetic   Did I hear that right Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLet me just clarify  These are    we re working with the clients on a relationship basis  So we re reaching out to them and looking to work with our customers  So it s not going to work for everybody  This isn t necessarily a posted rate  So this is doing outreach with our customers and value in those relationships  So we do expect them to reprice down Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystOkay  That s definitely helpful  And then I think just one of the earlier questions was just on the brokered single family residential portfolio  Just kind of trying to frame what the yield cut off would be just as those pay off  I mean  with that portfolio currently yielding around  I think  it s at 3 94   so we should see that come down  Is there a rate that you guys are posting for the single family portfolio that we can kind of use as a benchmark or it is still kind of not disclosed so Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerWhen you say a rate that we re posting for  what do you mean  Because we re not originating single family Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystOkay  So    but I didn t know if there was    so that entire    I mean  just based on that single family portfolio  I mean  you said that there was a portion of it that was brokered and then a portion of it  I imagine  was originated and held internally  So I didn t know if there was    there is anything   Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerLuke  I will tell you that a massive part of that portfolio was just broker originated  I mean  there are no deposits associated with it  And so it s a    they re all strong loans  We think the credit quality is good  It s a disproportionate percent of our NPLs  but overall    relative to the size of the portfolio  it s very  very small  And so  we think it s good credit quality  I d be happy to keep it  I think for our community bank and for a relationship focused business bank  obviously  having a large SFR portfolio is not what you would normally see in the mix  So we anticipate replacing those loans over time with better yielding relationship loans where you get deposits  I don t have a cut off for you of what    where that s going to settle in terms of loans  My expectation is that payoffs are going to slow  I mean  I think it s    to the extent that you want to reprice your multifamily loan or your single family loan  just in talking to clients  people wanted to take advantage of interest rates when they moved and they want to do it before interest rates moved again at the possibility that they could go the other direction  So I think there was a huge urgency around it and I think people repriced it  There may be others that lag and so I expect there will be more pass  I have a hard time thinking the pass are going to be at the same pace but it s to be seen and our expectation is that we re going to replace those    that run off with new high quality loans Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystOkay  That s really helpful color  Thank you for that  And then  Lynn  just a question for you  just I mean touching on the investment portfolio  there s great success in the repositioning this quarter given the pickup in yield  and just kind of wanted to know what reinvestment rates are on that portfolio and if we should see    I mean  because obviously it s moved from  I think essentially all CLOs are now just  I think  there are roughly 70  and I didn t know if there should be more repositioning in that manner toward diluting the effect of the CLOs and the security portfolio or just kind of do you mind giving us a little update on that Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So  I m going to say generally with the investment portfolio  we re looking to keep it in the range of about 11  to 15  of the balance sheet  probably at the lower end of the range  The CLOs now represent obviously a higher percent of that  At the end of the third quarter  there was some unsettled securities that came in in cash and that was redeployed during the fourth quarter  which I addressed  There is still a portion that we re addressing during the first quarter  But during the fourth quarter  let me say the reinvestment rates range between 2 40  up to at the high end  I think  4   I m going to say  So the key there is that the duration is shorter  So to the extent that we came out of a 2 40  rate  those were longer duration and we went back in at a 2 40  rate for a shorter duration  So they were better structured  even if the rate was similar  So the range is about 2 40  up to about 4  based on the type of security and we re looking to invest in sort of the same diversified basis that we were able to do in the fourth quarter As far as the CLOs  just generally we don t necessarily have any plans to sell them specifically  I appreciate that they are a large portion of the portfolio  but until such time we have an opportunity to redeploy them into another interest earning asset class with similar credit quality  we ll probably hold on to those Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystOkay  That s definitely helpful  And then just one last one for me  I mean    and you kind of touched on it earlier just with the S 3 filing and everything like that  I know historically  you guys have kind of tempered with the idea of potentially issuing some sort of sub debt just to kind of either buy back stock or pay down the preferred and I didn t know if that was still in the toolbox or I mean  given the current capital ratio  if you think that you wouldn t have to kind of issue any capital in order to redeem some of the outstanding Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe probably don t have to  I mean  we have  96 million coming due in June of 2020 and then we have another slot coming due in June of 2021  We want to be smart about it  We don t know which way rates are going to move  and we want to be appropriate with our capital  So we are looking at issuing sub debt  We haven t made a decision yet  Rates are pretty attractive  There s obviously with the trading at 7 375   the preferred  obviously with sub debt  you would have interest expense deductible above the line  And so whatever rate we go out at  it s going to be immediately accretive relative to the preferred  I don t think we re going to need to issue  100 million  We have plenty of capital  So we can use a combination and stuff  but we re looking at all those options Luke Wooten    KBW    AnalystOkay  That s really helpful  Thank you guys for taking my questions Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Luke OperatorThe next question today comes from Gary Tenner of DA Davidson  Please go ahead Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystThanks  Good morning Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Gary Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystHey  A couple of questions here  So  on the loan production for the quarter  understanding that the payoff activity obviously drove numbers down  but can you talk about specifically within C I and CRE where you re having the most success bringing in the types of credits that fit your profile and kind of relationship banking focus Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  sure  So I think there s two areas where we re going to show the most growth  both the natural dollars and percentage dollars  So on a percentage basis  we re going to show the most growth in traditional C I loans to businesses in our footprint  And I think we ve talked about in the past  I don t think we were doing a very good job at that previously  We didn t have the right team in place  We ve built the right team  we re adding players as we talk  and I think just traditional lending to businesses in our footprint of all stripes  lines of credit and term loans is going to show good growth for us because we re starting from a relatively low base  They re all coming with deposits  These are doctor offices  these are manufacturing facilities  these are local businesses that need our specialized service and appreciate our execution From a dollar percentage  I think we re going to show probably the most impact from bridge lending on the CRE side  lending to well heeled real estate sponsors who are active in dense urban markets where we have our footprint  who are buying properties  they need to rehab them and then ultimately  they ll take them out with permanent financing from us or somebody else  That s a big part of the market in Southern California  You get paid more for execution and for ready access to capital and when you re lending to people who do this over and over again from multifamily and other types of properties  you can build up a good track record and they call you and say   Hey that building we did last time  we ve got another one just like it  and you become their go to lender  And we re really focusing on that with the team that we brought in  As I said in the prepared remarks  it takes time to build this stuff up and we re in the middle of a process in terms of transforming our bank  It s not going to happen overnight  And so  over this year  we look to remix the balance sheet and I think the real growth is going to come in terms of higher levels of loan growth next year  I could be wrong because payoffs could temper and then we ll have the opportunity to show real growth along with deposit growth  but for right now  I think it s going to be kind of remixing story and hopefully that s going to make us more profitable Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystOkay  Thanks for the color there  And then just one other question  you guys have been under  10 billion for four consecutive quarters now  Could you remind us what the mechanics are for a bank to get out from under Durbin if it s dwells under  10 billion for some period of time and just from an impact perspective  if that would be meaningful Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So we have effectively no Durbin impact here  but I can talk more generally about being at  10 billion and what it means from a regulatory perspective  Generally  the regulators want to see you stabilize for a long period of time to make sure you re not bouncing back and forth between the different tiers of regulatory oversight  So  if there is no prospect of going back over  they ll kind of look at you and say  OK  it looks like you re below  10 billion and we ll treat you as such  We don t see a major impact from being below  10 billion  We have really good relationship with the regulators  It could be the timing of exams  maybe you would have them less frequently or they might group them a little bit differently  We re not that complex of business to begin with  We re pretty simple  but we don t see a major impact from a regulatory perspective being above or below  10 billion Gary Tenner    DA Davidson    AnalystGreat  Thanks  Jared Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo problem OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Moss of B  Riley FBR  Please go ahead Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystGood morning Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Steve Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystI want to start off on credit  I realized from the comments on the call there was a decrease in classified and actually an increase in criticized  Wondering  in particular  if you give some color around the  24 9 million commercial credit that was downgraded in the quarter  what the industry type and so forth Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s a C I credit  It s a client that we know  They were going through some changes  We expect that loan to be upgraded over the    possibly this quarter  but if it s not this quarter  it will be next quarter Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  And then just as we think about the loan loss provision and the reserve ignoring CECL for a moment here  kind of hard to see whether or not  call it  relatively stable balances  what would you expect for credit cost here going forward Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou re right  That s a tough one given that we are going to adopt CECL in January 1  So what I would expect is with the balance sheet or the loan portfolio continue to undergo its remixing to a certain extent the balances will be  let s just call them  relatively flat as the single family and multifamily continue to pay down and we re originating loans in our core business line  So  based on the factors and the modeling  we would expect that there would be provisions related to the new production  but it s    again  we re assuming the impact to be around    between the call it  10  to 15  and then we ll be carrying it forward from there based on our current quarter s production  As well now we re recognizing the provision for the entire estimated life of the loan at the time we put that on the balance sheet  So  it could be elevated levels as we move forward Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  CECL really penalizes duration and so to the extent that we re no longer originating long term fixed rate loans  we re going to benefit there  but we can t    what we have in our portfolio is what we have in our portfolio and that s going to be get marked under CECL day one  Also  CECL has different peer averages for the different classes of loans that you put on  And so by March 31  we will have gone through this process and figure it out  I think one thing that s going to affect banks generally is they re going to have to price loans differently  With the CECL impact  could be punitive and you ve got to figure out and make sure that you re making money on your loans and so that could change pricing on some loans and that s something that we re looking at very carefully and it s something that we thought about as we thought about the asset classes and the types of loans that we wanted to go into going forward to be    to make this Bank as good as we can On credit generally though  Steve  I would tell you that we feel really good about it  I mean  our credit is very stable  Overall  criticized and classified loans went down by  25 million  We had an uptick in the classified as you mentioned  but criticized went down by 40 million  And so the combined group went down by  25 million  So  I think we feel good about it  and I m not seeing any signs of weakness on the horizon that make me nervous  We got those two large NPLs  one s in SFR  which is  9 million and is a low loan to value and it just takes time to work out and the other one is the shared national credit we ve talked about in the past and everybody knows we re not doing those anymore So overall  I feel good about our credit quality Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then on the securities portfolio  you guys talked about completing the remixing here in the first quarter  Just wondering for the purchases  should we look for a similar level of municipal securities and corporate debt securities purchases  And kind of what is the level of credit risk you re interested in taking within the securities portfolio Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo generally  I would start with the credit risk that we re taking in the securities portfolio  We are    it will be a high quality securities portfolio  So  there ll be limited credit risk  generally speaking  and we are interested in some municipals as well as agency securities  So  I think you can expect to see a similar mix going forward Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  So the BBB portion of the portfolio is not likely to grow much basically Lynn M  Hopkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  that s a fair comment Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then in terms of the    in terms of just the    on the capital front  one more time  I m sorry if I missed this  in terms of return  it sounds like you guys are going to return capital  I know it s  Indecipherable  about the preferred  But does that include any thought on buybacks Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerWe re evaluating everything  I mean  we re looking at it all and that we obviously have enough capital to take more than one action  And so it s something that we re currently evaluating Steve Moss    B  Riley FBR    AnalystOkay  Thank you very much Jared M  Wolff    President and Chief Executive OfficerNo problem  Thank you OperatorThank you  Ladies and gentlemen  this does conclude today

106880,328395,BANC,MSCI  Banc Of California  Melco Crown Entertainment  Wynn Resorts And MGM Resorts International Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 14  2017   Zacks Equity Research highlightsMSCI  NYSE   NYSE MSCI      as the Bull of the Day Banc of California  NYSE   NYSE BANC      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Melco Crown Entertainment  NASDAQ   NASDAQ MLCO       Wynn Resorts  Limited  NASDAQ   NASDAQ WYNN      and MGM Resorts International  NYSE   NYSE MGM      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Investors have witnessed a huge surge in interest for all types of passive investing products  These types of investments and in particular  those in the ETF world have seen sizable inflows as more and more look for a buy and hold approach  or seek to reduce costs by looking to index based funds instead of actively managed securities which tend to be a bit more expensive  on average  This has been great news for index companies  as their benchmarks have become increasingly in demand as of late  And with fund companies often paying licensing fees to use the indexes based on assets under management  a boon in fund assets is a win for index providers too These trends make index providers worth a closer look  and that is why investors might want to put MSCI  NYSE      on their radars now Why MSCI  MSCI operates in a couple different areas  including analytics  ESG social research  real estate analysis  and of course  the index division which provides equity benchmarks for companies  as well as portfolio construction and rebalancing solutions  Analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on this business model as of late  and it doesn t hurt that the company has a great track record in beating earnings estimates either In fact  it is showing an average earnings surprise of 5 6  in the past four quarters  and it appears somewhat optimistic on the full year time frame too  I say that because analysts have also been increasing estimates for the current quarter and the current year as of late  and we actually haven t seen any estimates  at all  go lower for the current quarter or the current year in the past two months These analyst moves have also had a nice impact on the consensus estimate  as this has seen a boost over the past few weeks  In fact  the current quarter estimate has increased by roughly 5 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 4 4  in the same time frame Bear With North Korean tensions dominating the headlines  investors are piling into safe havens  This is having a huge impact on Treasury bonds  pushing yields lower in the process It is also dulling the prospect of a rate hike by the Fed in the near term  and while we have seen a broad market sell off a result  the impact has been especially poor for the financial sector  That is because this segment depends on a solid yield to fuel profits  and a risk off environment doesn t help that trend We can see a great example of that in many names in the financial space as of late  while some in particular have been suffering from longer term issues too  These types of companies which are experiencing both short term woes and longer term trouble may make for poor investments in today s environment  and investors may want to consider avoiding them in the near future  A great example of this is with Banc of California  NYSE       today s bear of the day Why BANC Banc of California has a few major issues when we consider its fundamentals  including a poor recent history in earnings season  This includes two straight misses  something that is definitely indicative of a poor trend That isn t all though  as the company is seeing sliding earnings and sales when compared to the year ago period  while analysts are increasingly bearish about the company s future  This includes several analysts slashing estimates in the last month for both the current quarter and the current year  and also a complete lack of analyst estimate upgrades in these time periods We have also seen a huge cut to the consensus estimate as a result of these analyst downgrades  In just the past month  the consensus estimate has declined by nearly 40  for the coming quarter  and close to 30  for the full year  Clearly  the stock has earned its Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  ranking and may be poised for more weakness in the future too Additional content Casino Stocks Fall  Is North Korean Tension to Blame Shares of some casino industry powerhouses fell across the board on Thursday  many of which have ties to Macau  the world s newest gambling Mecca  However  with tensions surrounding North Korea escalating  the hotspot s close

travel from nearby Hong Kong fell by 3 9   and Taiwanese tourism dropped by 9 9  The report cited expensive transportation costs and pricey accommodation as possible reasons for June s slowdown in tourism But it seems for now casinos can breathe easy if June numbers hold  as visitor rates weren t down across the board  The number of overnight visitors to Macau grew for the 23rd month in a row Japanese tourism increased by 13 5  and South Korean numbers skyrocket by 42 2  according to the OCBC report  However  June was a long time ago in terms of the geopolitical climate  If the North Korea situation keeps getting worse  which seems like a strong possibility  travel to Macau could slow and in turn help bust some casino stocks Investors should keep a close eye on these numbers from Japan

106886,328401,BANC,TCF Financial s Digitization Efforts On Track  Time To Buy  ,opinion,"On Jan 2  we issued an updated research report on TCF Financial Corporation   NYSE TCF    The company s digitization efforts to fulfill customer requirements and solid organic growth indicate its upside potential 
Though escalating expenses and declining fee income remain concerns  the company s strong capital position keeps it well poised to undertake opportunistic growth ventures Shares of the company have gained 4 4  in a year s time  outperforming 3 3  growth of the  it belongs to 
Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has been revised 1 1  upward  over the last 30 days  As a result  it currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

TCF Financial s consistent organic growth keeps us encouraged  Over the five years ended 2016  the company s loans and deposits have witnessed a CAGR of 3 7  and 5 1   respectively  Also  aided by the improving economy  uptrend in these balances is likely to continue in the near term The company s focus on strengthening footprint in the Chicago region along with introduction of digital platforms are likely to help it better serve customers  In February 2016  it had announced its plan to close 33 retail branches located inside Jewel Osco grocery stores in Chicago and replace them with advanced ATMs 
Recently  TCF Financial closed the acquisition of Rubicon Mortgage Advisors  LLC  With offices in Minnesota and North Dakota  Rubicon is a residential mortgage lender  Such inorganic growth activities reflect its strong capital position 
Further  its credit metrics have been improving over the last few quarters  Also  its diversified loan portfolio helps in keeping credit quality at normalized levels 
However  consistently increasing expenses and falling fee income are likely to deter bottom line growth to some extent

106901,328416,BANC,If The Fed Raises Interest Rates  Buy These 3 Banking Stocks,opinion,"Minutes from the Federal Reserve s April meeting suggest that officials are open to the possibility of raising interest rates as early as June   After the minutes were released  stocks as a whole went lower   However  one sector saw shares shoot up  
While most industries will have to pay more to finance operations with debt  the banking industry stands to gain a lot from a rising interest rate environment   Banks are the primary lenders for corporations  so when the federal funds rate increases  so do the rates at which banks lend at   At higher interest rates  banks stand to earn higher profit margins  
If you believe that jobs growth  consumer spending and inflation will rise  then you may also believe that the Fed will raise interest rates sooner than later   If this is the case  then you will want to buy banking stocks which have the best chance to beat earnings expectations when they report their quarterly earnings  
Below are three such banking stocks that are well positioned with regards to posting a beat on our EPS consensus   They each have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   so they look like solid investment candidates to pick up over the short term
