14402,235917,ED,New York Deals Critical Hit to  1 Billion Shale Gas Pipeline,news," Bloomberg     New York denied a key permit for a  1 billion Williams  NYSE WMB  Cos  shale gas pipeline  dealing a critical blow to a project that would shuttle fuel to customers in New York City and Long Island 
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation said Wednesday that the pipeline would result in water quality violations  including those caused by kicking up hazardous metals and disturbing seabed habitats  The denial was  without prejudice   meaning the company can reapply  Williams said in a separate statement that the DEC had raised  a minor technical issue  with the application  which it will resubmit quickly 
The decision comes as states tussle with the Trump administration over pipelines designed to carry abundant natural gas to the Northeast from shale basins in Pennsylvania  Ohio and West Virginia  President Trump has taken action to speed up approval of interstate gas conduits  last month signing an executive order that aims to short circuit state regulators who have held up projects by denying necessary permits amid environmental concerns 
Northeast Supply Enhancement  which would add pipeline segments in New York  Pennsylvania and New Jersey to an existing Williams system  joins a slew of gas proposals in the region that have faced delays  Construction of new conduits has failed to keep pace with growing demand for the heating and power plant fuel  leading Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED   to stop accepting applications for new gas service in New York s Westchester County 
Northeast Supply Enhancement
Another proposed Williams pipeline  Constitution  remains stalled after failing to obtain a water permit from New York  The state s regulators initially denied the certificate for Northeast Supply Enhancement last year  saying Williams submitted an incomplete application 
Environmental groups have argued that Northeast Supply Enhancement is unnecessary and would further New York s reliance on fossil fuels  Williams and one of its customers   National Grid   LON NG  Plc  say the project is needed to meet demand during the winter months  when consumption of the heating fuel peaks and prices can spike 
National Grid  which has customers in Brooklyn  Queens and Long Island  said it remains cautiously optimistic the project will be in service on schedule by the winter of 2020 21  The company will continue to advise new applicants that its ability to provide guaranteed service depends on construction of the pipeline  a spokeswoman said by email 
Pipeline opponents have said the state s decision would be a signal of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo s commitment to address climate change  Cuomo has introduced a state level version of Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez s Green New Deal  calling for the New York s electricity to be 100  carbon neutral by 2040 
 The state has made it clear that dangerous gas pipelines have no place in New York   Kimberly Ong  senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council  said in a written statement   Instead of further locking in our reliance on fossil fuels  New York is rightly capturing the power of the wind and the sun and investing in a local clean energy economy  
Northeast Supply Enhancement  which gained federal approval earlier this month  is also awaiting a water permit from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  The agency is expected to make a decision by June 20 
In its letter Wednesday to a unit of Williams  the DEC focused on the impacts of the 17 4 mile  28 kilometer  stretch of 26 inch diameter pipeline  referred to as the Raritan Bay Loop  which would run underwater en route from New Jersey to Queens  The agency said construction of the project would result in the re suspension of sediments and other contaminants  including mercury and copper  and disturb shellfish beds and other seabed resources

14405,235920,ED,Cuomo Expands ConEd Probe as Heat Wave Triggers 53 000 Outages,news," Bloomberg     New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is expanding a probe into recent New York City power failures as Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED   reported about 53 000 customers suffered outages amid a heat wave and record demand 
ConEd s website Sunday night showed customers without power at various times included more than 37 000 in Brooklyn and 13 600 in Queens areas  Cuomo s office said it directed the State Department of Public Service to expand its investigation into ConEd outages  which was opened after a failure last weekend left 72 000 customers in Manhattan s West Side without power 
 We have been through this situation with ConEd time and again  and they should have been better prepared   Cuomo said in a statement   This was not a natural disaster  there is no excuse for what has happened in Brooklyn  
The company didn t respond to an emailed request for comment on the governor s statement  It said in a release that it preemptively took customers in southeast Brooklyn out of service in order to protect equipment and to help restore power as soon as possible 
The affected Brooklyn neighborhoods in Sunday s outage include Canarsie  Flatlands  Mill Basin  Old Mill Basin  Bergen Beach and Georgetown  The company reported on its website 20 922 customers without power across its service area as of 4 39 a m  local time Monday 
Relief Expected
Sunday s outage comes as relief is expected from dangerous heat baking a swath of the U S  Lower temperatures are forecast after heat advisories and excessive heat warnings stretched from Oklahoma to Ohio and along the East Coast from Maine to South Carolina 
ConEd had earlier in the day asked customers in southeast Brooklyn and parts of Queens  as well as some Bronx neighborhoods  to conserve energy while crews work to repair equipment

14406,235921,ED,PG E negotiates price cuts on five solar  battery contracts,news," Reuters    PG E Corp  N PCG  on Thursday told a U S  bankruptcy judge that it had reached agreements to cut prices by at least 10  on five power contracts  according to court papers 
The company said it had reached the deals with three energy generators and storage providers  including Recurrent Energy  a unit of Canadian Solar Inc  as well as energy storage providers mNOC AERS LLC and Hummingbird Energy Storage LLC 
PG E said in court papers on Wednesday that it  strongly disagrees  with a suggestion in a Wall Street Journal article that the utility company knowingly deferred maintenance on equipment that caused California s Camp Fire  the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state s modern history 
PG E s bankruptcy poses a major threat to up to  42 billion of power contracts  mainly for renewable solar and wind energy  Those agreements are critical to California s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting its aggressive climate goals and what happens to them in bankruptcy is being closely watched by both investors and state officials 
The utility estimates that it can save about  20 million from the negotiated discounts  PG E said  adding that the companies had asked PG E to renegotiate their contracts to stem the uncertainty and the risk of obtaining the financing needed to complete underlying projects 
The deals include three solar projects by Recurrent and two battery storage projects 
A U S  bankruptcy court ruling in June that a federal regulator had no say in whether utility PG E may reject its power purchase agreements if it chooses to while in bankruptcy

14407,235922,ED,EQM stops some work on WV VA Mountain Valley natgas pipe,news," Reuters    EQM Midstream Partners LP  N EQM  told U S  federal regulators the company would stop some work on its long delayed Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia as the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service reviews a couple of permits 
Despite the delay  analysts on Friday said they expect Mountain Valley will enter service in the third or fourth quarter of 2020  The company has said the  4 8  5 0 billion pipe would enter service in mid 2020 
Officials at EQM were not immediately available for comment 
In a letter to the U S  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  on Thursday  EQM said it was voluntarily suspending new work on Mountain Valley in areas where such activities present a potential risk to endangered species or destruction of critical habitat areas 
EQM s decision to suspend work was in response to a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club earlier this week in the U S  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  according to analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington 
In that case  the Sierra Club asked the court to vacate Mountain Valley s biological opinion and incidental take statement  which allow construction of the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species 
The analysts said they do not expect the Fish and Wildlife Service or EQM will pursue litigation since the Fourth Circuit would likely side with the Sierra Club as the court did in a case against another long delayed project   Dominion Energy Inc s  N D  Atlantic Coast pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina 
Instead  EQM decided to voluntarily suspend work  the analysts said  noting the company had already completed work in those areas or was already barred from working in them until it gets a new permit from the U S  Army Corps of Engineers that would allow the pipe to cross streams and other waterbodies 
Height Capital expects the Army Corps will reissue the permit in coming months 
When EQM started construction in February 2018  it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about  3 5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018 
The 303 mile  488 km  pipeline is designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day  bcfd  of gas  One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U S  homes for a day

14408,235923,ED,Treasuries  Top Trade at Risk as Long Dated Yields Take Flight,news," Bloomberg     The Treasury market s top performing trade is under threat as the U S  and China appear to be closing in on a partial trade deal  boosting prospects for global growth and quicker inflation 
U S  government debt due in a decade or more has returned more than 15  this year through Nov  5  on track for its biggest annual gain since 2014  according to a Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  index  But the performance has started to fizzle  with the measure extending declines to a third straight month as 10  and 30 year yields touch the highest since September  And investors will be keenly focused on the longer end of the curve this week  with the U S  Treasury preparing to sell 10 year debt on Wednesday and 30 year bonds the day after 
The recent sell off in longer maturities may simply be the result of investors trying to lock in returns as 2019 draws to a close  according to  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  Investment Management  Duration    the longer it is  the bigger the gains when yields fall    has been the biggest contributor to fixed income returns  bar none   said portfolio manager Jim Caron 
 If duration giveth  duration taketh away   Caron said   If rates go back up  you re going to find that people will be very quick to try and preserve those gains  
Rates on 30 year Treasuries climbed as high as 2 35  Tuesday  up from a record low of 1 9  touched in August as angst over the global ripple effects of trade friction spread and inflation expectations tumbled  They were at 2 32  in early U S  trading Wednesday 
Benchmark 10 year yields  which touched a high of 1 87  on Tuesday  are around 1 84   up from a three year low of 1 43  set in early September  Ten year yields are still down more than 80 basis points in 2019  compared with a drop of close to 70 basis points for the long bond 
Bonds around the globe have mirrored the recent move in Treasuries  with yields on 10 year German bunds rising 43 basis points from a September low  A similar Australian benchmark has also climbed more than 40 basis points from its August trough 
Caron says the U S  economic outlook argues for the 10 year yield to be closer to 2   a level last seen in August  He s been reducing duration in his portfolios since early October 
Surprisingly strong U S  services data released Tuesday and optimism that the Trump administration may remove tariffs on Chinese goods prompted traders to dial back Federal Reserve rate cut expectations  Market based measures of inflation expectations are on the rise again  and the yield curve is steepening 
Auction Pressure
The back up in longer dated yields comes as the U S  prepares to auction a combined  46 billion of 10  and 30 year bonds Wednesday and Thursday 
The supply of Treasuries should widen the gap between 5  and 30 year yields  according to JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  rates strategist Jay Barry  He estimates that from current levels around 67 basis points  the curve is roughly 15 basis points too flat 
 It s natural that as the Street and investors make room for the longer duration supply that comes in the middle of the month  the curve steepens in anticipation   Barry said 
A similar trend has also been seen in Japan  Yields on 10 year Japanese sovereign bonds climbed to the highest in more than five months on Wednesday after weaker than expected demand at a 2 1 trillion yen   19 billion  auction 
 Higher yields could become a trend if the U S  China trade talks continue to progress   said Tadashi Matsukawa  head of fixed income investment at PineBridge Investments Japan Co 
In U S  credit meanwhile  investment grade bond deals non financial issuershave also been targeting longer maturities  The average for new deals in the market Tuesday was about 26 years  up from 15 years on Monday  and about 13 years for this year so far Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  placed a bigger than expected  600 million in 40 year bonds tight to its existing curve 
Double Down
Not everyone is convinced higher yields are in the offing  For one thing  a trade accord between the U S  and China is hardly a done deal 
TD Securities strategists recommend  doubling down  on long 10 year Treasury positions  targeting a drop in yields to 1 6  
 Global growth and trade uncertainty remain headwinds  despite recent positive headlines  analysts Priya Misra and Gennadiy Goldberg wrote in a Tuesday note   Foreign inflows this year have been the highest since 2012  and low global rates suggests these flows are unlikely to abate  
Brown Advisory s Thomas Graff sees long bonds losing regardless of whether the economic outlook brightens or worsens from here  On the one hand  it s unlikely that inflation expectations will surge and buoy longer yields  But at the same time  the 30 year probably won t rally as much as shorter maturities should the Fed be forced to cut rates meaningfully in the months ahead 
For that reason  he s underweight the longest parts of the curve 
 If you have a lot in the 30 year  I feel like you re vulnerable on both ends   said Graff  head of fixed income at the  6 2 billion asset manager

14448,235963,ED,Consolidated Edison  ED  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Consolidated Edison  ED  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 50 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 06  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Con Ed 
For Con Ed  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 52  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Con Ed will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Con Ed would post earnings of  0 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 58  delivering a surprise of  3 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Con Ed doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consolidated-edison-ed-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200479039,200479039
14449,235964,ED,Consolidated Edison  ED  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"Consolidated Edison  ED  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 54 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 59 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 56 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  3 14   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility would post earnings of  0 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 58  delivering a surprise of  3 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Con Ed  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  3 37 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 80   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 33 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Con Ed shares have added about 20 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 2  
What s Next for Con Ed 
While Con Ed has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Con Ed was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

However  declining vehicle demand in North America and frequent vehicle recalls are concerning Toyota  Amplified labor costs  majorly in Japan  Asia and North America  along with increased raw material costs across regions are adding to the company s expenses  Thus  investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point

Meanwhile  uptake of key drug  Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions  However  Amgen is progressing with its pipeline  In the past five years  Amgen has launched nine products  including two in new therapeutic areas  Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars pipeline  which could be an important long term growth driver for the company

Markedly  continuous rise in consumer traffic and strong merchandising policies are fueling comps  These along with TJX Companies  off price model  strategic store locations and impressive brands have been driving store and online performance  This was reflected in the company s second quarter fiscal 2020 results  wherein customer traffic rose for the 20th straight time

142354,363869,ED,No new natural gas hookups in New York s Westchester County  Con Ed says,news," Reuters    New York energy company Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED  said on Friday it still plans to impose a moratorium on new natural gas service in parts of Westchester County after March 15 despite a  250 million plan by the state to reduce energy usage   The moratorium will still go into effect after March 15   Con Edison spokesman Allan Drury said  noting the company needs to stop hooking up new gas customers to avoid compromising gas system reliability because of limited space on existing interstate pipelines into the region   Westchester County is north of New York City  New York State has blocked construction of new interstate pipelines for environmental reasons for years as Governor Andrew Cuomo and other state officials want utilities to focus more on renewable power sources and energy efficiency programs  instead of building more gas and other fossil fuel fired power plants and infrastructure  Consumers  however  want access to more gas to heat homes and businesses because it is cheaper and cleaner to burn than oil  This winter  U S  Northeast households  on average  are expected to spend  723 to heat with gas and  1 646 with oil  according to federal estimates  Drury said Con Edison has received more than 1 300 applications for new gas hookups since notifying the state of the moratorium on Jan  17  well above the number the company normally receives during a two month period  On Thursday  the state announced several steps totaling  250 million to reduce energy consumption and fund alternative energy programs  The state said the programs will  provide immediate relief to Westchester County businesses and residents affected by Con Edison announcement that it will put new applications for firm natural gas service on a waiting list beginning March 15   The programs  which are estimated to reduce energy consumption equivalent to the amount of gas needed to heat over 90 000 homes  include funding for clean energy alternatives like electric heat pumps and high efficiency appliances  The problem with those programs is they only reduce demand  not boost gas supplies  To provide gas to more customers and maintain system reliability  Con Edison has said it needs more programs to reduce demand and more interstate pipelines and storage facilities

142357,363872,ED,Earnings Preview  Consolidated Edison  ED  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Consolidated Edison  ED  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 6  
Revenues are expected to be  2 67 billion  down 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 3  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Con Ed 
For Con Ed  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 25  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Con Ed will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Con Ed would post earnings of  1 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  2 22  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Con Ed doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-consolidated-edison-ed-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200445078,200445078

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Con Ed shares have added about 11 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 9  
What s Next for Con Ed 
While Con Ed has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Con Ed was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

142390,363905,ED,Consolidated Edison  ED  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Consolidated Edison  ED  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 39 billion  up 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 6  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Con Ed 
For Con Ed  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 07  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Con Ed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Con Ed would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of  1 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Con Ed appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consolidated-edison-ed-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200410990,200410990
142391,363906,ED,Consolidated Edison  ED  Surpasses Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Consolidated Edison  ED  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 38 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 35 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 37 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2 22   A quarter ago  it was expected that this utility would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of 1 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Con Ed  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  3 51 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 58   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 36 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Con Ed shares have added about 11 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for Con Ed 
While Con Ed has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Con Ed was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 63 on  2 76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 36 on  12 55 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

142422,363937,ED,Financial firms fear turmoil over fraught U S  debt ceiling talks,news,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price WASHINGTON  Reuters    Financial firms are sounding alarm bells and dusting off contingency plans over fears an increasingly dysfunctional U S  Congress may fail to reach a deal to raise the country s debt limit  Several lobbyists  representing dozens of bankers  investors and credit rating agencies  told Reuters they are worried that dynamics at play in Washington   a bitterly divided Republican party and unpredictable President Donald Trump   could rule out a deal before an October deadline   Policymakers have vowed to provide disaster relief to areas affected by Hurricane Harvey  boosting hopes the debt limit battle could be included in an agreement on a legislative package  But the acrimonious atmosphere following Trump s remarks about the Charlottesville protests this month  which cost him key backers in the business community and raised worries about his ability to broker a deal  still lingers  The debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations  Failure to raise it from the current  19 8 trillion could lead to default  sending shockwaves across global markets   The stakes here are incredibly high  The economic impact associated with debt default is so immense   said Rob Nichols  president and CEO of the American Bankers Association  ABA   one of the country s key financial lobby groups    We re monitoring this extremely closely and we will mobilize as needed throughout September   While leading lawmakers and the administration have pledged it will get done  some corners of financial markets are already on edge  After all  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimated that failure to lift the cap would force a government spending cut equal to between 3 and 4 percent of U S  gross domestic product  which would have crippling economic consequences  Moreover  previous debt limit negotiations went down to the wire  and the now notorious 2011 standoff led S P Global Ratings to downgrade U S  sovereign debt for the first time  The episode wiped  2 4 trillion off U S  stocks   The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  SIFMA   a trade group representing hundreds of financial firms  said it had reprised contingency plans drawn up during the previous showdowns and was working with firms to prepare for extreme volatility in the event of a default  These plans aim to ensure firms have enough technology capacity  staff and cash to handle high trading volumes   A separate plan being reviewed by another trade organization  the Treasury Market Practices Group  TMPG   includes protocols for trading in defaulted Treasuries  according to information on its website  SIFMA is also planning for that    We want to make sure we re on the same page and prepared  should anything happen   said Robert Toomey  SIFMA s managing director and associate counsel   We believe this will get done  but we still have to prepare for it notwithstanding   A spokesman for the TMPG was not immediately available for comment   DEMOCRAT VOTES Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to raise the cap by Sept  29 and said last week he was  100 percent confident  this would happen  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have also promised the United States would not default But Wall Street players  who are highly exposed to any potential market mayhem  are worried Mnuchin and McConnell will not be able to get a divided Republican party to play ball  Many conservative Republicans have indicated they will only vote for a debt limit bill that contains promises of federal spending cuts  meaning Trump  Mnuchin and McConnell will likely need Democrat votes to get the bill through  The president is also seen as a wild card after he failed to denounce Nazi sympathizers at protests in Charlottesville  This  combined with his attacks on members of his own party  has raised questions over Trump s ability to build consensus on the debt limit  one bank lobbyist said   Everyone is very worried   he added   Trump last week tweeted that the ceiling was  now a mess  blaming Ryan and McConnell   He took the two people he has to count on for this  and smack  ed  them around  It s going to make it harder   said Steve Bell  a former Republican director of the Senate Budget Committee and now director at the Bipartisan Policy Center  referring to Trump s tweet   The White House did not respond to a request for comment  Industry executives also point to an understaffed Treasury  which has yet to hold meetings with banks and investors   a tactic used by the Obama administration to calm Wall Street jitters   Lobbyists said they expected to hear from the administration after Labor Day  when they would also attempt to persuade skeptics in Congress to pass the limit   Treasury routinely reaches out to market participants to foster a steady dialogue on key issues  including the debt limit   said a Treasury spokesperson

142426,363941,ED,NGG Vs  ED  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Utility   Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with National Grid  LON NG   NGG  and Consolidated Edison  ED   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
National Grid has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Consolidated Edison has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that NGG likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ED has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
NGG currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 95  while ED has a forward P E of 19 34  We also note that NGG has a PEG ratio of 9 30  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ED currently has a PEG ratio of 9 67 
Another notable valuation metric for NGG is its P B ratio of 1 48  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ED has a P B of 1 56 
These metrics  and several others  help NGG earn a Value grade of B  while ED has been given a Value grade of C 
NGG sticks out from ED in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that NGG is the better option right now ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ngg-vs-ed-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200403059,200403059

When looking at the last two reports  this utility has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 36   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Con Ed came out with earnings of  0 77 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 76 per share  representing a surprise of 1 32   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 48 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 56 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 41  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Con Ed  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Con Ed has an Earnings ESP of  2 42  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner

142451,363966,ED,Consolidated Edison  ED  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Consolidated Edison  ED  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 80 billion  down 5 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Con Ed 
For Con Ed  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 44  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Con Ed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Con Ed would post earnings of  1 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 56  delivering a surprise of  5 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Con Ed appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consolidated-edison-ed-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200388230,200388230

Dollar traders remain pessimistic  focusing on twin deficits instead of rising inflation

Key Events
Yesterday  all four major US indexes the S P 500 Index  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  the NASDAQ Composite and the Russell 2000 extended their rebounds to a fourth day  even as Treasury yields climbed to a four year high  after consumer price data increased bets the Federal Reserve will accelerate its tightening cycle 
The S P 500 Index advanced 1 34 percent  led by Financials  which bagged a 2 38 percent gain since expected higher rates would benefit bank earnings  Utilities underperformed  suggesting investors were rotating back out of defensive stocks and into growth equities  The Real Estate sector also lost 0 63 percent in value  as traders cashed out after shares outperformed in Wednesday s session with a 0 73 percent rise  The SPX is now back to positive territory year to date  up 0 95 percent  after tumbling 11 8 percent from its January 26 peak 
The Dow is up 1 04 percent after yesterday s trade  higher by 0 8 percent for the year  reversing its harsh 12 25 percent slump from the index s January 26 high 

The NASDAQ Composite was the leader of the pack  jumping 1 85 percent  The tech heavy index also outperformed peers on a year to date basis as it returned to a positive 3 5 percent after falling 11 5 percent from its January 26 peak 
The Russell 2000  while coming in as the second best performer yesterday with a 1 75 percent jump  is underperforming for the year so far and holds the dubious honor of being the only major US index still down for the year  0 85 percent in the red 
January s employment report showed that wage growth increased 2 9 percent YoY  the fastest pace since 2009  Wage growth is a leading indicator for the overall inflationary trend  as companies tend to raise prices to consumers to cover added labor costs  Higher prices raise inflationary pressure and thus the likelihood that the Fed hikes interest rates as a counter measure  Higher interest rates would in turn boost the cost of borrowing  making it more difficult to support record high equity prices 
In other words  stocks fell  because the economy is strong and is able to support higher interest rates  As such  all eyes were glued to yesterday s CPI figures  to gauge whether they would confirm the faster economic growth trend highlighted by January s wage growth reading 
Indeed consumer prices jumped 0 5 percent MoM  beating analysts  0 3 percent estimate  Initially  stock prices fell  However  equity markets closed higher  Why  How is that possible 
It was the second set of US data investors received  projecting higher inflation  that ironically propelled stocks higher on the day  Retail sales decreased 0 3 percent  missing a 0 2 growth forecast and posting the biggest decline in 11 months  as households cut back on motor vehicles and building materials  The underwhelming figure raised questions over the strength of the economic growth trend 
In textbook economics and stock analysis  the market is a leading indicator for the broader economy  The overall intelligence of smart money is ahead of the curve when it comes to economic turns  In other words  company earnings are dependent upon the nurturing environment of a healthy economy 
However  investors are conditioned human beings  They have been spoiled by unprecedented accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve  which seems to have led investors to no longer care about the state of the economy  Rather  investors have grown used to focusing squarely on the bottom line of company earnings  So much so that they bet a strong economy would hurt corporate earnings  a bet that was enough to prompt the worst two week equity selloff in two years 
Conversely  when they read that retail sales experienced their weakest month in nearly a year  they gather that companies will profit  pushing them to extend the current stock market rebound into a fourth day 
Meanwhile  new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested on Tuesday that the Federal Open Market Committee would forge ahead with gradual tightening even as it keeps an eye on financial system risks following the recent equity rout 
Global Financial Affairs
This morning  global equity markets extended their rebound  starting from the Asian session  Even shares in Tokyo rose for the first time in four days  with the TOPIX index bouncing off a four month low  even as the yen continued climbing after hitting a 15 month high yesterday  Until Wednesday  the stronger yen forced Japanese shares to buck the trend and miss out on a powerful rebound  as a stronger currency hurts exports and renders stock prices more expensive after going through the exchange rate  But the fact that Japanese shares could rise forcefully against such a powerful yen underscores investor bullishness  they are betting that stocks will rise even against weaker exports 
Stocks advanced in Australia as the S P ASX 200 Futures Index climbed  Hong Kong equities on the Hang Seng finished their best three day run in more than two years in shortened trading ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday 
The STOXX Europe 600 Index followed in the footsteps of Asian indices  advancing for a second day  S P 500 Futures suggest US stocks will open higher 
Bond traders increased their expectations for the number of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes to four by the end of next year after a report showed US consumer prices rose more than projected in January  The inflation figures gave little comfort to dollar bulls  who are instead focusing on the US twin deficits   the national economy s current account balance and the government budget balance  giving rise to debate among investors and traders on the breakdown in market correlations 

Yesterday  the dollar Index slipped 0 3 percent to 88 879 after losing more than 0 6 percent overnight despite the strong CPI inflation numbers 
The recovery in broader risk sentiment was seen weighing on the dollar  which had gained during the market turmoil earlier in the month  The US currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year  including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easier monetary policy 
Technically  the USD price is nearing its January 26  88 44 trough  A lower price would signal a resumption of the downtrend  It is interesting to note that the lowest price for the dollar index since December 2014 coincided with the highest price for equities  before the selloff 

Exante Data s founder and CEO Jens Nordvig  that there s a  very profound  disruption of long standing correlations behind the moves seen in the dollar yen   The FX market has been very surprised by some of the breakdowns in correlations we ve seen   he noted  adding that the USD JPY exchange rate decoupled from US interest rates   The really big story is that the dollar is tanking  
Comments by Japan s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso that the yen s strength is not marked enough to intervene  supported the Japanese currency s rally into a fourth day  as the dollar deepened its descent against all major peers 
Technically  the USD JPY price has dipped below and bounced back above the bottom of a falling channel since December 2016  After a 6 percent decline this year  it may be ripe for an upward correction within the downtrend 

The yield on US 10 year Treasurys kept chugging closer to 3 percent  reaching 2 93  continuing its steady advance from last year s low of 2 01 percent in early September 

Metals gained on the dollar s weakness and oil benefited from the comeback of risk appetite  Technically  WTI s price peaked above its broken uptrend line since August 31 and shifted back down 

Gold extended a rally to a fourth day  nearing its January 25   1 366 13 peak  A higher price would signal a resumption of the uptrend 

South Africa s rand traded near a three year high after President Jacob Zuma stepped down on escalated government pressure  Technically  the USD ZAR pair confirmed the completion of a continuation pattern by the name of Rising Flag  bearish within a downtrend  aided both by a strong rand on the political development and a weak dollar

142505,364020,ED,Consolidated Edison Had A Solid First Quarter,opinion,"Summary

NYC City and surrounding areas are growing  and the region s LEIs are up  indicating further growth is probably on the horizon 
Consolidated Edison Inc  NYSE ED  had a nice increase in gross revenue last quarter 
While they had higher expenses  lower taxes led to higher net income 
 This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community    

I begin most of my reviews of specific utility companies by examining a few broad macroeconomic statistics of the geographic area where the utility operates  Utilities  like any other business  can really only expand when the underlying economy is growing  Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  sells power in and around the NYC area  This map from the Edison Institute provides better detail 

The Northeast economy is centered around a few metropolitan areas  with NYC being the most predominant and important  The city s GDP has been expanding at a consistent pace 

 Data from BEA  author s calculation 
From 2010 to 2016  NYC grew between a 1 5  and 5 5  Y Y pace  Over the last four years  the average Y Y percentage rate of growth was 3 6  
However  the most recent data is less bullish 

In the 3Q17  NY GDP s annual growth rate was 0  

 Data from BLS gov 
The unemployment rate moved slightly below 5  at the end of 2015  where it has remained 
However  the immediate economic future looks strong 

 Data from the Philadelphia Fed 
The leading index  which is primarily comprised of building permits and initial unemployment claims  points to continued growth over the next 6 12 months 
Consolidated Edison is the 6th largest electric utility by market cap  which is  23 92 billion  It is currently the cheapest  with a current PE of 3 6  But this number is abnormally low due to one time factors  the forward PE  17 7  provides a more realistic measure of the company s current valuation  Compared to 53 other electric utilities  ED s forward FPE makes it the 31st cheapest  Its dividend of 3 62  is about 65 BP  LON BP  higher than the current 10 year Treasury and is the 22nd highest among its electric company peers 
Like all utilities  ED must get approval from its respective state utility authority to raise rates  This is an ongoing process with all utilities  According to the latest 10 Q 

ED increased their latest NY rate request by  2 2 million to  22 million 
Decreased their gas request by  1 7 million to  2 7 million

These are their two primary requests 
Across the country  utility officials are asking utilities to reevaluate their rate increase requests to include the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December  In situations where we have a final decision  this has unanimously resulted in either a rebate passed onto customers or a decrease in the utility s base rate  The New York authority and ED are currently negotiating on this very point  investors should expect a decrease in the utility s rate request 
ED is facing higher expenses due to two reasons  The first was a subway shutdown that occurred over the summer  According to 

Through March 31  2018  the company incurred costs related to this matter of  149 million  Included in this amount is  27 million in capital and operating and maintenance costs reflected in the company s electric rate plan and  122 million deferred as a regulatory asset pursuant to the rate plan  The company  which plans to complete the required actions in 2018  expects to incur costs related to this matter during the remainder of 2018 of  115 million  Included in this amount is  5 million in expected capital and operating and maintenance costs reflected in the rate plan and  110 million expected to be deferred as a regulatory asset pursuant to the rate plan 

The second was the negative impact from this winter s severe storms  which cost the company an additional  106 million  so far  
Let s turn to their quarter quarter earnings table from their latest earnings release 

The company s Y Y increase in quarterly earnings was 4 21    a good rate for a utility  Two sources of revenue contributed to the increase  a 10  increase in gas sales  caused by more inclement winter  and a 74  increase in  non utility  income  The former accounts for 28  of the company s revenue and is therefore far more important  The latter only accounts for 7  of revenue  Moving on to expenses  purchased power decreased  But  due to the more severe winter  gas costs were up 18  while maintenance advanced 13   As a result  operating expenses were higher leading to a decline in operating income  But  thanks to a lower tax bill  income tax expense declined nearly 50    net income was higher 
As with all utilities  the company s primary risk going forward is regulatory  While the new administration is most assuredly more friendly towards the industry  New York is very much a blue state  which means a less friendly atmosphere 
Looking at the stock s technical situation reveals a currently bullish environment 

The above table and chart show the relative strength of the 10 largest constituent members of the XLU relative to the SPYs  With the exception of Dominion  D   all members are currently outperforming the SPYs  This observation includes ED 
ED s stock chart is also attractive 

ED started to sell off in mid December  this was in conjunction with the bond market sell off  due to their heavy dependence on debt financing  utilities are disproportionately sensitive to bond market movements   ED then dropped with the broader market correction that started in late January  But it has been rising consistently since  Prices are now right about the 200 day EMA 
ED is an attractive utility  They had a solid quarter with a good increase in revenue  Thanks to the tax cuts passed in December  ED had more income flow to the bottom line  They should be able to recoup some of their increased expenses over the next 12 18 months  And  the chart is technically attractive  If you ve ever wanted to own ED  this would be a good place to take a position

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Visa  NYSE          Shell  NYSE         and HSBC  NYSE         

	Buy rated Visa shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Services Transaction sector over the last year  up  16 1  vs   14 7   but is behind rival Mastercard  up  19 4    Visa s earnings beat expectations and also increased year over year  Results were driven by the acquisition of Visa Europe and solid growth in payments volume as well as processed transactions 

	The Zacks analyst likes the company s strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing efforts  In addition  global economic uncertainty and legal headwinds are major concerns  Higher client incentives also pose a risk on profitability   You can   

Shell shares have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry over the past six months  up  6 5  vs   2 6  gain for the industry  as well as its smaller rival BP  LON BP   up  4 4    The integrated behemoth s upstream unit swung to a Q1 profit from a year ago loss thanks to steady oil price recovery during the period and production contribution of BG assets 

	The Hague based supermajor was also able to reduce operating costs and progress on its large divestment program  Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company generated a surge in cash flows  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend  However  with oil falling below the psychologically critical  50 threshold again

HSBC  shares underperformed the Zacks categorized Foreign Banks industry over the least six months  gaining  9 1  vs  14 5   Further  the bank s first quarter 2017 net income declined  reflecting absence of Brazil business results  A dismal European economy and weak loan demand are expected to lead to muted revenue growth in the quarters ahead

142615,364130,ED,Valuation Is A Measurement Of Soundness  Not The Primary Total Return,opinion,"Introduction
Much of what I write about is related to the importance of valuation in one way or another  I do this  because I am a fervent believer that one of the most important metrics that investors should be considering before investing in a stock is the relative valuation of the shares they are purchasing 
To summarize what I m saying  if they are interested in investing in a company and discover that the current market valuation is very high  I contend they should either wait or look elsewhere for better valuation  In contrast  if valuation is fair or sound  then I contend they could comfortably go ahead and make the investment  Finally  if the valuation is significantly undervalued  I contend they might consider investing aggressively 
However  before they even get to that step  they should be investigating a company that meets their specific goals  objectives and risk tolerances  This is vitally important  because valuation is not the final say in the rate of return they can expect from their investment in a given company  Instead  valuation is primarily a measurement of soundness or risk 
Although it is an important component of the possible rate of return they might achieve  it is not the primary driver  Once sound valuation is identified  from there the primary driver of future returns will be the growth rate of the earnings and dividends  if any  that the company generates going forward  Investing when valuation is sound empowers the investor to safely earn a rate of return that is commensurate with the operating results that the company they invest in produces in future time 
With this article  I intend to demonstrate the importance of fair valuation and how it mitigates risk  and how it can be utilized to assist in evaluating the future rate of return you can expect from investing in a given stock  This is consistent with the importance and utilization of the P E ratio as a measurement of soundness or fair value  In my experience  both the relevance of fair valuation and the importance of the P E ratio are grossly misunderstood by many  With this article  I intend to bring some enlightenment and better understanding of both 
Choose Common Stock Investments That Are Appropriate to Meet Your Goals or Objectives
There are many types of common stock investments available to investors  In other words  common stocks come in all sizes and shapes with each possessing their own individual characteristics  There are companies  stocks  that grow at very high rates and others that grow at moderate rates and some that grow very slowly   and everything in between 
Consequently  if you re an investor looking for maximum capital appreciation  a company with a slow rate of earnings growth will not fit your needs  In contrast  if dividend income is what s most important to you  then you want to look for companies with consistent records of paying a dividend and or growing that dividend over time  Additionally  you also have the consideration of yield in combination with growth  Some stocks offer high yield and low growth  some offer moderate yield and moderate growth  and some even offer high growth with very low yield  Of course  there is also everything in between 
The trick is to understand the characteristics of the common stocks you are considering  and most importantly  making sure that they are suitable to meet your own specific needs  goals and objectives  In other words  I believe it s imperative that investors recognize what the potential capability and specific opportunities that any stock they are considering might be capable of giving them  Not all stocks are the same  and not all stocks fit in every portfolio 
However  in order to choose the common stocks to meet your own goals and needs  you also have to be realistic and understand a couple of important facts  For starters  you cannot solely depend on a company s historical track record of growth  You must be cognizant of the fact that earnings growth rates change  and as a general statement  the bigger the company gets the harder it is for it to continue growing at high or above average rates 
This last statement is conceptual in that there can also be companies that are growing slowly  but can be expected to continue growing at historical rates  In other words  what I am suggesting is that you understand as comprehensively as possible what the companies you are considering are capable of generating on an operating basis going forward 
Although you cannot invest in the past  you can learn from it  Moreover  it also pays to be realistic and even conservative with your expectations of the potential of any company you are examining  Again  this is important because you can only invest in the future potential of any common stock you are considering  Whether your expectations turn out to be accurate or not  your total rate of return will end up being a function of the actual operating results the company produces in conjunction with the valuation you initially paid to purchase those results 
Many times in the past I have stated that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  However  I would like to modify that statement a little bit in order to make it more relevant  Measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation in conjunction with growth potential is a job half done 
I believe that when an investor understands the importance of valuation  and possesses a reasonable expectation of the growth potential of the companies they own  they are empowered to make safer  better and more profitable long term decisions  I call it investing with your eyes wide open 
In order to illustrate these principles more clearly  I offer the following examples illustrating how growth and valuation impacts long term rates of return  However  I am not capable of presenting every possible situation or option  Therefore  I will only be offering a few disparate examples in order to illustrate as clearly as possible the principles underlying the primary thesis of this article 
Utility Stocks  Slow Growth Above Average Yield
Most utility stocks could be described as consistent  low growth businesses with high payout ratios offering above average current yield  Consequently  it would not make sense to invest in a utility stock with the expectation of achieving a high rate of capital appreciation  The characteristics of utility stocks simply do not present that opportunity  Instead  utility stocks can be included in a portfolio when above average current yield is a priority  However  it would also be unrealistic to expect a high rate of dividend growth  In the long run  a utility stock s dividend is likely to grow consistent with and in conjunction with its earnings growth rate 
In a similar fashion  this would also be true of investing in bonds  Investors do not invest in bonds with the idea that they might double  triple or quadruple their money  Instead  bonds are typically invested in when the investor is looking for safety in the form of return of capital  not return on capital  and predictable yield  Of course  today yield on bonds are low  Consequently  utility stocks could be considered as bond alternatives  However  they do not possess the guaranteed return of principal offered by the bond  but they do offer reasonable yields with modest growth and relative consistency 
 Consolidated Edison  Inc  a Classic Utility Stock Example
I chose Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  as a stereotypical example of a utility stock to represent the characteristics utility stocks typically offer  As usual  I will turn to  the fundamentals analyzer software tool in order to illustrate my points  With my initial graph  I present only the earnings and dividends that Consolidated Edison has generated over the timeframe 1998 to its last completed fiscal year 2015 
The orange line on the graph represents a P E ratio of 15 and is offered as a fair valuation reference  In other words  at this point I m suggesting that a P E ratio of 15 on Consolidated Edison represents soundness or fair value  However  as previously indicated  fair valuation only tells part of the story  The second aspect of the orange line that is critical to understand and recognize is the slope of the line  By slope  I am referring to the average earnings growth rate that that orange line represents in this example 
The color coded FAST FACTS to the right of the graph lists the 15 P E ratio in the orange section  and the dark green section lists the average earnings growth rate  slope of the line  of only 1 7   The dark green shaded area represents a mountain chart of the company s earnings  and the white line plots dividends with the area below it representing the company s dividend payout ratio  The light green shaded area on top of the orange line represents dividends after they ve been paid out to shareholders  Note  these representations will apply to all subsequent graphs to include other companies  however  the numbers will be different with different examples 

This next graph adds monthly closing stock prices  the black line   and here is where the valuation reference discussed earlier becomes important  When the price is touching the orange line  P E ratio 15  fair valuation is implied  When the price is below the orange line undervaluation is indicated  and when the price is above the orange line overvaluation is indicated 
There are a couple of important observations that I would ask the reader to evaluate  First and foremost  note how the price tends to correlate to and with the fair valuation reference  Stated more simply  where earnings go price has followed  However  there are times when the two become disconnected which represent the overvaluation or undervaluation situations 
The next  but equally as important consideration  is to note that over the long run the price has not appreciated very much because neither have the earnings  The average earnings growth rate of a mere 1 7  clearly has limited the long term capital appreciation potential that Consolidated Edison has provided shareholders 
These principles will hopefully become clearer when you examine the performance report associated with the above graph  Capital appreciation  Annualized ROR  has only averaged 2 5  annually  see yellow highlight   which is highly correlated to the company s earnings growth rate  It is only slightly higher because initial valuation had price slightly below the orange line  and ending valuation had price only slightly above it 
The cumulative dividends illustrate the value of investing in a slow growth utility stock  if dividend income is your goal  However  the reader should also note that the average dividend growth rate has only been 1 3  and the compound average growth rate  CAGR  of 1 2  both correlate closely to the company s earnings growth rate over this time period  Clearly  investing in utility stocks is all about the dividend income and not about a high rate of capital appreciation 

The only way that you can expect to get capital appreciation greater than the company s earnings growth rate is to buy the stock at a low valuation and then measure future performance when its valuation is high  My next example looks at Consolidated Edison from 2006 when the stock was fairly valued to current when the stock is now significantly overvalued  Once again  note how the stock price correlates to and tracks closely to earnings  But more importantly  note how quickly price returns to fair value when it does get disconnected 

When you look at the performance report associated with the above graph  you note that capital appreciation of 4 9  exceeded the company s earnings growth rate of only 2 8   Consequently  when you measure the performance and recognize that the company was fairly valued at the beginning and is now overvalued  you understand why capital appreciation exceeded earnings growth  To repeat  measuring performance without simultaneously measuring appreciation and earnings growth is a job half done 

With this next graph  we scroll back in time and look at 2012 to 2015 where we can clearly see the effects that even moderate overvaluation can have on a slow growth stock like a utility  During this timeframe  we see the slope of the line or the growth rate at 3   which is almost double the long term historical we saw earlier on the long term graph  However  the starting P E ratio on January 1  2012 was 17  only moderately higher than the 15 fair valuation reference P E ratio 15  and the ending valuation was a P E ratio of 15 8 which is only slightly higher than fair value 

When we look at the associated performance report  we discover that capital appreciation is only  9  in spite of the 3  growth  The point being that even moderate overvaluation when investing in a slow growth company severely limits the capital appreciation you might receive  Consequently  when investing in low growth investments like utility stocks  the importance of valuation is heightened 

With my final set of graphs on Consolidated Edison I present the timeframe 2010 to 2015 where valuation was approximately fair at both the beginning of the period and the end  Note that in this timeframe Consolidated Edison s average earnings growth rate was 4 7   which is still relatively low  but higher than what we saw on the other examples 

With valuation closely aligned in both the beginning and the end  a quick check of the associated performance report shows capital appreciation of 5 9  which is generally in line with the company s earnings growth rate over that timeframe  To summarize  what I have attempted to show with these examples on Consolidated Edison is that valuation is a reference of risk and soundness  When thinking about total return  valuation in conjunction with the company s earnings growth achievement must be also considered 

Lessons on Valuation  Johnson   Johnson Higher Growth Blue Chip But Growth Is Slowing

By moving from the low growth utility sector to the faster growing blue chip dividend growth stock Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   we can learn several additional lessons on valuation  Since 1997  Johnson   Johnson has grown earnings at the average rate of 9 4   However  on December 31  1996 Johnson   Johnson was trading at a P E ratio of 23 which is significantly above the fair value reference of a P E ratio 15  Currently  Johnson   Johnson trades at a lower blended P E ratio of 18  which indicates a P E ratio contraction versus the initial purchase 

Nevertheless  even though you overpaid for the stock in the beginning  the above average rate of earnings growth still enabled you to earn a total annual return of 9 5   The point being  if the company is growing fast enough  you can pay more than fair value and still earn a decent rate of return over the long run  The calculated performance on the following graph shows that shareholders that purchased Johnson   Johnson on December 31  1996 earned an annualized rate of return of 9 5   Most people would take that rate of return if it was guaranteed 



However  if we take a deeper look at the performance results we discover that capital appreciation only averaged 8 3   which was less than the company s earnings growth rate of 9 4   However  dividends made an additional contribution which brought the total return up to the 9 5  total annualized rate of return  Moreover  Johnson   Johnson s valuation from 1997 all the way out to 2007 was higher than earnings justified over that entire timeframe  Although the return was decent  I would argue that the risk associated with achieving it was rather high as I will illustrate next 



This next illustration shows the risk associated with investing in even a high quality AAA rated blue chip like Johnson   Johnson when its valuation is high  This is an extreme example from the perspective of investing in Johnson   Johnson at an all time high valuation and then measuring its performance 8 years later at an all time low valuation  What is not shown on this graph is the fact that this was a time period when Johnson   Johnson grew earnings at 11 7  per annum  Consequently  you could have owned it and lost money investing in this blue chip based on high valuation  even when the company itself was performing in an exemplary manner 

With my final Johnson   Johnson example  I once again illustrate that had you not panicked and sold at the bottom and still held Johnson   Johnson today  you would have received a positive total annual rate of return of 5 8   Once again  that is not a horrible return assuming you had the intestinal fortitude to hold on during all the valuation challenges that followed  Valuation is a component of total return  but its primary value relates to risk assessment and soundness 

Cisco Systems  Inc 
With my final example on this essay on valuation as a measurement of risk and soundness  I will turn to Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   Most investors should remember the incredible bubble in technology that began to burst in the summer of 2000 to 2002  At its peak on August 31  2000  Cisco was trading at an incredible P E ratio of 132  To me  this represents a pure picture of the risk associated with high valuation  Although it is extreme  it clearly illustrates how valuation can destroy returns over time  even when the company performs well on an operating basis 

Had an investor purchased Cisco on that fateful day in calendar year 2000 and were foolish enough to have held all these years  that investor would have lost more than half of their money  But most importantly  the company did well as a business  and instituted a dividend in 2011 that has grown at an incredible rate  Although extreme  this is a clear picture of valuation as a risk assessment 



With my next Cisco example I also look at a period of time when Cisco was overvalued   but not at the extremes I showed in the first example  Once again  we see that Cisco performed rather well where earnings grew at a 6  average rate  and just a few years before they started paying a dividend  Cisco s P E ratio at the beginning of this performance measurement was 21 6  That is still high  but nothing like we saw in the previous example 
Although Cisco was able to eke out a modest rate of return over this timeframe  it was hardly justified and certainly not reflective of how the business itself performed  Cisco is a high risk investment that time  and the subsequent returns  illustrate the risk of paying too much 

With my next and final example on Cisco  I look at a time when Cisco was significantly undervalued and available at a P E ratio of only 9 6  Similar to what we saw with the previous graph  Cisco was growing earnings at an average of 6 6  per annum during this time 

However  in contrast to what we saw when we overpaid for the stock  the exact opposite is true when Cisco was purchased at a bargain  This was the timeframe when the company was paying a dividend and was simultaneously undervalued  Over this timeframe  capital appreciation came in at 14  which is slightly more than double the earnings growth rate  and when you add in dividends to total annualized rate of return came in at 16 3  

Not only is this an exceptional rate of return  but it also significantly outperformed the S P 500 over this timeframe  But most importantly  the risk taken to achieve this return was extremely low relative to what we saw previously  Valuation is clearly a measurement of soundness and risk  but when you get it right  it can also produce powerful and better than justified total returns

Summary and Conclusions
With this article  I have primarily covered the principles of valuation and earnings growth from a historical and current perspective  My primary objective was to illustrate the importance of fundamental valuation as a measurement of soundness and risk control  Additionally  although attractive fundamental valuation will contribute to total return  it is not a guarantee of high returns  However  sound valuation in conjunction with the future operating performance that the stock you invest in achieves will be the key factors that generate long term results 
In part 2  I will continue my discussion on valuation and earnings growth  however  my primary focus will be on assessing the future  I believe that investors should have a clear perspective on the potential returns that an investment in any given stock might be able to achieve for them  Importantly  this does not suggest that investors can precisely know what rate of return an investment in a stock might generate  However  they can have a reasonable expectation and understanding of what a given stock investment might be capable of achieving  I call this investing with your eyes wide open  In part 2  I will discuss how those perspectives can be developed

142619,364134,ED,The Week Ahead  Time To Look Past The Gloom ,opinion,"We have a huge week for economic data  The Fed is now on hold until after the election  The election can still go either way  It is easy to find something to worry about  That said  the fourth quarter is usually good for stocks 
Should investors look past the gloom  
Last Week
There was plenty of economic news  and it was generally positive  The election had a lean to Clinton  which the market seems to like  but not a decisive verdict  There were two wild cards   the rumors about an OPEC deal and the concerns about Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   Both introduced day to day volatility  but not a lasting effect  The jury remains out on both 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted a focus on the first presidential debate  wondering if this would provide a clear path for investors  That was half right  The debate dominated discussions early in the week and post mortems continued for a couple of days  There was no clear KO  so the election effects are still in doubt 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500 from Doug Short  Stocks had a flat week and a rocky path 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all of the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective  You can easily see the whipsaw on the OPEC and Deutsche Bank stories  In a break from recent trends the market traded inversely with oil early in the week before the  OPEC rally   Some attributed this to the debate  The Deutsche Bank story sent markets lower on Thursday  with many seeing another  Lehman moment   One day later  the pundits explained why the circumstances were not the same as in 2008  Who really gained from the scary stories on Thursday 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
The Good 
Earnings are set to improve  Earnings guru Brian Gilmartin has been on this theme for weeks and adds to the evidence  Dr  Ed Yardeni joins in  suggesting that Q2 was the trough 

Congress avoided a government shutdown   Are prospects for compromise better 
Trucking increased sharply  Calculated Risk 
Global activity is stronger   that stable oil prices might be the reason  Readers may remember that I mentioned the possibility of a  sweet spot  in oil several weeks ago 
New home sales were strong  beating expectations and up almost 21  year over year   why this is important for the economy 
Chemical activity is stronger  I noticed that several sources are now following this data series   shows the leading quality of the indicator  represented in this chart 


The Bad 
Pending home sales declined 2 4   missing expectations 
Restaurant performance decreased 1  from July  Several sources are citing a  restaurant recession  
Deutsche Bank faces a large fine  possibly requiring more capital  Many worry about effects on other banks  Some hedge funds have reduced trading and maintaining collateral with DB 
Durable goods production showed no increase 
The Ugly 
Potential   While it is unlikely to change the outcome  it is important that results are perceived as legitimate   Yes  I have heard of Mayor Daley   Even Nixon accepted the 1960 results  The  that Congress should warn Russia 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week I want to highlight Evidence Soup  by   She definitely has the right idea in her work   of whether immigrants disrupt US employment is both important and timely  She highlights evidence that supposedly disproves this notion  but there is a lot of work in evaluating it  I sympathize with this challenge  What do you think 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have a very big week for economic data  While I watch everything on the calendar  you do not need to  Check out WTWA to focus on what is really important   and ignore the noise 
The  A  List 
Employment report  F   Rightly or wrongly  even rather small changes create large reactions 
ISM Index  M   Rebound expected in a private indicator with some leading qualities 
ADP private employment  W   A strong measure of employment changes  deserving of more respect 
Auto sales  M   Private data on an important growth sector 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
ISM Services  W   Not as interesting as the manufacturing index  but only because the series is shorter 
Construction spending  M   Important sector  but August data 
Trade balance  W   Important part of the GDP calculation for Q3 
Factory orders  W   Volatile August data  but an important sector 
Crude inventories  W   Often has a significant impact on oil markets  a focal point for traders of everything 
Did you get enough FedSpeak after the FOMC meeting  the press conference  the speeches last week  and the Yellen Congressional testimony  No  If not  you will have several more opportunities to get even more transparency and clarity this week 
Next Week s Theme 
Despite warnings to sell in May  the worst month of August  and the dangers of September  stocks have posted another positive quarter  The fourth quarter is positive over 80  of the time  But wait  To some the list of worries seems more important than usual  The biggest include the following 
Election uncertainty
Recession chances economic weakness
Length of the bull market
Misleading corporate earnings
These factors have most market participants in a gloomy mood  The market resilience this year will have the pundits wondering  Is it time to look past the gloom  
The ever witty  if sentiment is detached from reality 

Yes  and it s always been that way  the consensus of opinion and the investor herd move in exactly the wrong direction at exactly the wrong time 


That s because investors rarely focus on anything beyond what they re hearing and seeing today 


And in the words of our good friend  in Chicago   It s not what s now that matters  it s what s next  

Bill Kort uses actual reader counts to demonstrate the effect of negative headlines    He notes   The articles I publish with overtly negative titles draw far more readers than those with neutral to modestly negative elements  
As always  I ll have a few ideas of my own in the conclusion

Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read AR every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  There are always several great choices worth reading  My personal favorite this week is  of  deplorable  investments  I see the ads for many of these and become ill  If there was only some way to help individual investors before they lose a lot of money on an overpriced  illiquid asset  Here is a list of products that provide big fees to those offering them  and significant restrictions on the buyers 
Equity Indexed Annuities   How about an investment with limited upside but large potential for a substantial loss  Throw in a  and no dividend participation  50  of historic market returns  and we have the ingredients for a deplorable retirement scenario 
Funds with 12b 1 Fees   Fund size and investment returns are negatively correlated  Investors are paying a  designed to increase assets and reduce returns  Kind of like paying a restaurant to give you food poisoning 
Proprietary Mutual Funds   This is cross selling at its most heinous  Never buy a mutual fund created by a broker s employer  this is the ultimate  
Non Traded REITs   A false promise of safety combined with 10  upfront commissions  this is a true   Just because something is not traded doesn t mean it cannot go down in value  By the way  their publicly traded cousins have vastly outperformed this group over time  because of greater transparency and lower fees 
Commodity Funds   High risk combined with low returns rarely ends well  These products specialize in something called  Contango   Investor translation  Nearer dated futures  prices are lower than the longer dated ones  or more commonly known as buy high and sell low  rinse and repeat 
Variable Annuities   These are often sold on the pretense of guaranteed income and tax deferred growth  In reality  very few investors need this product fraught with   These are often placed inappropriately in tax sheltered accounts  investors do not need both a belt and suspenders 
Front Loaded Mutual Funds   Investors pay a premium of 5 75   and an additional 1  a year in fund fees to purchase an investment that is almost guaranteed to underperform an unmanaged index fund costing  05   annually  There is NEVER a reason to pay this fee 
Over Niched ETFs   Healthcare Shares Dermatology and Wound Care ETF and  funds are all that needs to be said  The prosecution rests its case 
Hedge Funds   2  annual fees combined with 20  of yearly profit makes it pretty hard for investors to bring home any type of meaningful positive returns  While there is a  of hedge funds that are worth the steep price  they are either closed or have account minimums that rule out everyone except for the Bill Gates  crowd 
Market Linked C D s   The ultimate vanilla investment has been  Unless you enjoy paying a 3  commission and having the possibility of losing principal due to early withdrawal  run away from anyone who approaches you with this nonsense  Purchasing a complicated structure that will underperform your Credit Union s basic offering is a deplorable choice

Final Thoughts 
Concerning the debates  there are three different methods of scoring 
Points on specific issues   the method for formal debates  You look at each issue and determine who got the better 
Technique  This is how we coach  You look for opportunities to insert carefully prepared  blocks   These have pre tested language and evidence 
Change of opinion  This is  of course  what ultimately matters 
As someone who has judged hundreds of debates and followed them closely in all presidential elections  I thought that Secretary Clinton did better on point one and decisively better on point two  Being a coach for Mr  Trump would be very frustrating  He really likes to wing it 
That said  there was no knockout blow or major blunder  Voters are not watching this like debate judges  Mr  Trump s message obviously resonates with many  The polls show a slight move toward Clinton  but the issue is still open with two debates to go 
Recession odds are low  Every week we see wannabee analysts who have no track record  This includes those at big name firms  Understanding the economic cycle is one of the biggest advantages for the astute investor 
Bull markets  and economic cycles  do not die of old age  This is another great misconception  The odds of four heads in a row is 1 16  What do you think it is after you have already flipped three 
Energy earnings have colored overall results  We need to look forward 
The current market worries are no worse than ever  For perspective  look back at how negative everyone was when people criticized me for  Dow 20K

I never invest in a common stock without a clear expectation of the future returns that it can generate for me  Consequently  I consider this one of the most important steps in my research and due diligence process  Unfortunately  my experience in dealing with investors has led me to conclude that this important step is rarely taken  Most investors possess only a vague idea of what they might earn from investing in a given stock  Many people simply buy a stock hoping that it will go up  and if it pays a dividend  hopeful that the dividend will increase over time 
With this article  I m going to share my specific process on how I estimate the future return that a stock can be expected to offer me  My primary example will be based on a current investment in the blue chip Dividend Aristocrat Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Through this exercise I will offer a methodical approach designed to determine whether Johnson   Johnson is a viable investment choice at today s valuation 
Johnson   Johnson  Forecasting Future Returns
In part 1 of this two part series I reviewed Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   Consolidated Edison  Inc  NYSE ED  and Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  from a historical perspective  Reviewing a company s history and how the market has typically valued the company s operating results is typically the initial step in my due diligence process  However  I consider forecasting the future potential of any company the most crucial step in my due diligence process 
Directly stated  I will never invest in a stock until I have made a determination of what rate of return the investment might potentially produce for me  This is essentially done under a most likely case  best case and worst case scenarios  I m not na ve enough to believe that I can make these calculations with absolute precision  Instead  my objective is to determine future return possibilities within reasonable ranges of accuracy and predictability  But most importantly  this gives me more that a vague idea of what the return potential that a company might produce for me  I call this investing with my eyes wide open 
However  before I move on to my forecasting process  I would like to briefly review what I saw when I examined Johnson   Johnson s valuation history over different time periods  You can examine my historical approach more comprehensively by reviewing the link to my previous article above 
In order to review historical valuations  I rely on the  fundamentals analyzer software tool  I always start by looking at all of the company s history available to me  The following long term earnings and price correlated graph on Johnson   Johnson revealed two important aspects related to valuation  First of all  I noticed that the market applied a premium valuation on Johnson   Johnson shares from 1997 through the spring of 2007  However  from that point forward the market was valuing Johnson   Johnson s shares at a lower valuation  I have drawn a line on the graph separating these two time periods  Note that the normal P E ratio calculation of 20 2 is high because it is skewed by the high valuations over these first 10 years or so 

When I shortened the timeframe to cover the period 2006 to current  I discovered that the normal P E ratio that the market has applied over this timeframe has been approximately 15  Importantly  I consider these more recent valuation levels more relevant  Therefore  my fair value assessment for Johnson   Johnson is set at the more conservative P E ratio of 15 than at the longer term normal P E ratio of 20 2  Consequently  with the current blended P E ratio at 18 1  I would consider Johnson   Johnson moderately overvalued at these levels  As promised  what follows will be the rate of return calculations I believe this valuation level offers 

When writing articles like this I can only include a picture of a live fully functioning graph  Therefore  I have arranged to have a live fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  available to readers  Next I will offer a few simple calculations utilizing the Forecasting Calculators and their calculating functionality  However  the calculators allow me to run numerous  what if  calculations based on various assumptions  If the reader follows the below link they will be able to quickly and easily run as many of their own calculations as they desire 
Here is the  for a FAST and FUN Preview of F A S T Graphs using the stock symbol JNJ
Once you follow the link  scroll down to the Forecasting Calculators where you will find five calculators that can be utilized to estimate the future return potential on Johnson   Johnson  Each calculator is color coded and the following screenshot illustrates how to access each calculator  My first calculation will be based on utilizing Johnson   Johnson s normal P E ratio of 15  the dark blue tab and border  

The calculator is presenting forecasts based on the consensus analyst estimates reporting to S P Capital IQ  With this Johnson   Johnson example there are 23 analysts forecasting earnings for fiscal year end December 2016 and 25 analysts forecasting earnings for fiscal year end 2017  From there  the number of analysts drops off to 17 analysts for fiscal year end 2018 and only 11 analyst for fiscal year end 2019  This information is found at the bottom of the graph as    Analysts  
Assuming that these analysts are reasonably correct  and the company s stock price was valued at a normal P E ratio of 15 3  red circle   then Johnson   Johnson would be expected to deliver a total annualized rate of return of only 3 57  out to December 31  2019  Personally  I would consider this too low of a rate of return potential which is due to moderately high current valuation  I consider this  as I will elaborate later  my most reasonable case scenario 

In contrast  if I ran these calculations utilizing the long term historical normal P E ratio of 20 1  red circle   the investment in Johnson   Johnson looks a lot more attractive  Although I would consider this a possibility  my confidence that Johnson   Johnson would trade at that valuation is low  Therefore  I would consider this more of an optimistic or best case scenario  Nevertheless  the 11 97  total annual rate of return would be considered attractive 

At this point  I ve run these expected and best case scenarios utilizing the specific consensus analyst estimates over the next few years  However  many investors hold a rather jaundice view of the accuracy of analyst estimates  On some companies these negative views on analyst estimates are justified  however  there are certain companies where the analysts  track records have been exceptional  Johnson   Johnson happens to be one of those companies that analysts have tended to estimate correctly 
The following  Analyst Scorecard  summary shows that analysts have been accurate with their forecasts on Johnson   Johnson virtually 100  of the time  This record assumes a 10  margin of error for forecasts made one year in advance  and a 20  margin of error for forecasts made two years in advance 

This next screenshot provides a more detailed look at the record of analysts making a one year in advance forecast of earnings on Johnson   Johnson  Therefore  I think it is reasonable to assume two things about Johnson   Johnson s estimates  One  Johnson   Johnson must be a relatively easy company to make forecasts on  Two  in my opinion  since analysts rely heavily on company guidance  Johnson   Johnson s management must give good solid guidance  However  the main point I am making with these scorecards is that my confidence level is high regarding the earnings forecasts in the above calculators  Therefore  I feel it is highly likely that they would turn out to be reasonably accurate 

Once I have run calculations utilizing specific consensus estimates for the next few years  I like to examine the return possibilities utilizing a longer term 3 to 5 year trend line calculation  The calculator utilized to run these calculations would be found on the third tab on the forecasting calculators  options 

There are 9 analysts  see FAST FACTS box to the right of the graph  offering a 3 to 5 year trend line earnings growth estimate on Johnson   Johnson at 6 07  on average  If those trend line estimates happen to come to pass and Johnson   Johnson traded at a P E ratio of 15 on December 31  2001  it would only offer me a 4 8  rate of return  Once again  I would not be too excited about that long term rate of return possibility notwithstanding Johnson   Johnson s impeccable quality 

On the other hand  if I utilize that same growth expectation but applied the long term normal P E ratio of approximately 21  my rate of return potential would be much more attractive  However  recent historical data suggests that valuation level might be overly optimistic  Nevertheless  this would be another possible best case scenario 

Once I have examined the consensus trend line estimates based on analysts reporting to S P Capital IQ  I like to check other sources to see what other analysts think  Therefore  I checked the five year growth forecast on Johnson   Johnson from Morningstar  Here I found a much lower estimate for longer term growth of only 3 8  on average 
 Morningstar Five Year Growth Forecast 


Consequently  I then went to the  Custom  calculator option and entered a custom trend line growth rate of 3 8   red circle  according to Morningstar  Once again  utilizing the normal P E ratio of 15  my rate of return calculation on Johnson   Johnson based on Morningstar estimates only averaged 2 35  per annum  Perhaps this could be considered a worse case   or maybe even just a bad case scenario for this blue chip Dividend Aristocrat  Nevertheless  it provides additional insights generated by my due diligence process 

Additionally  I often like to run rate of return calculations where I utilize historical earnings growth rates in lieu of analyst estimates  This is an approach that Ben Graham suggested  This next calculation utilizes the  Historical CAGR   Compound Annual Growth Rate  of 5   red circle  on average for Johnson   Johnson over the past 5 completed historical years  All things considered  I consider this 5  growth rate achievable for Johnson   Johnson  Consequently  I would consider this a plausible case scenario 

However  I never stop with just running calculations based on analyst estimates or historical earnings growth rates on any company I am researching  My next step is to check other research providers in order to assess the validity of the assumptions utilized in my calculations  What follows is one example utilizing Morningstar research and their discussion of Johnson   Johnson s economic moat  However  I will check several other research providers for additional information as well 

  Morningstar Research  Economic Moat 07 19 2016  We believe Johnson   Johnson carries one of the widest moats in the healthcare sector  supported by intellectual property in the drug group  switching costs in the device segment  and strong brand power from the consumer group  The company s diverse revenue base  strong pipeline  and robust cash flow generation create a very wide economic moat  An extensive salesforce makes J J a powerful candidate for a smaller biotechnology company looking to partner on a new drug  which strengthens Johnson   Johnson s ability to bring new products to market 
Johnson   Johnson s diverse operations are a major pillar supporting the wide moat  The company holds a leadership role in a number of segments  including medical devices  OTC medicines  and several drug markets  Further  the company is not overly dependent on one particular operating segment  the pharmaceutical business  medical device group  and consumer products represent 40   40   and 20  of total sales  respectively  Additionally  within each segment no one product dominates sales  as Pfizer  NYSE PFE  s Lipitor did  Despite carrying some lower margin divisions  J J maintains strong pricing power and has posted gross margins above 68  during the past five years  validating its strong competitive position  

Finally  after checking numerous research sources  I like to conclude my due diligence by going to the company s website to see what they have to say about their future  The following excerpts are from Johnson   Johnson 2nd Quarter 2016  






One of the areas I am most interested in is the company s earnings guidance  The following slides and the accompanying F A S T  Graphs  Forecasting Calculator illustrate that the company guidance and analysts  estimates are aligned  The 2016 earnings forecast of  6 69 is in the middle of the guidance range provided by Johnson   Johnson 






Johnson   Johnson   Why I m Not Selling
After running the above return calculations for Johnson   Johnson going forward utilizing various scenarios  I have concluded that I do not consider Johnson   Johnson a compelling investment at today s valuation  However  I make a distinction between making a buy decision versus a sell decision 

The following historical graphs on Johnson   Johnson are marked with a green dot indicating the day that I bought this blue chip  With the first graph  I have run a calculation of the rate of return I have achieved on my Johnson   Johnson investment thus far  As you can see  this has been a very profitable holding  Because I purchased the stock when it is undervalued  and considering that it is now moderately overvalued  my results have been better than what the company produced on an operating basis 

With such a nice profit on my investment  it would be very tempting to sell and harvest that return  However  one of my primary reasons for investing in the stock was the company s impeccable history of increasing their dividend every year  Consequently  if I sold  I would be giving up that future dividend  But as previously suggested  I believe in investing with my eyes wide open 

Therefore  I have run a calculation to see what my rate of return would be if the company reverted to the mean by year end 2017  Obviously  if that happened it would be lower  On the other hand  I would still be earning a double digit return  And of course  there is the possibility that Johnson   Johnson s stock price would maintain its current P E ratio  Once I ve established a solid position in a great business like Johnson   Johnson  I am very reluctant to sell unless valuations become extreme  I don t consider Johnson   Johnson s current valuation extreme  therefore  I plan on continuing to hold it for a long time 

The Bottom Line

I hope the reader recognizes that the primary message I m attempting to deliver with the above exercise is to always invest with your eyes wide open  To me this means establishing a reasonable expectation of what the business behind the stock is capable of delivering  and then calculates a reasonable rate of return expectation on that basis  In other words  never invest on just a hope or a prayer 

Follow up Examples From Part 1

In part 1 of this two part series I covered two additional companies  Therefore  in this part 2 I wanted to give the reader the opportunity to run their own calculations regarding the future return potential of Consolidated Edison  Inc  and Cisco Systems  Inc  However  I will spare the reader from repeating the exercise as I did with Johnson   Johnson above  Instead  below I have provided links to live fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on both of these companies  Additionally  I have provided a few screenshots just to get you started   you choose to take the opportunity to follow the links and run your own calculations

Summary and Conclusions

As I stated in part 1 of this two part series  common stocks come in all sizes and shapes  There are certain companies that might be attractive based on their dividend yields  Other companies might be attractive based on their future growth potential  And  of course  there is everything in between  This simply implies that different types of companies are capable of producing significantly different future rates of return  The primary drivers will be the growth potential of each business  coupled with the valuation you paid to purchase those results 

The key to success is to identify the types of companies you are comfortable investing in  and that are capable of meeting your own goals and objectives  However  I believe that no matter how much you like the company  you should always be keenly aware of the valuation you are being asked to pay  One of the best ways to implement and apply a disciplined approach to investing is to run the numbers out to their logical conclusions 

With this article  I utilized the  Forecasting Calculators  provided by the F A S T  Graphs  research tool  However  the same process could be applied utilizing a simple spreadsheet  Earnings estimates are available from many sources  and there is never a substitute for conducting your own comprehensive research and due diligence  My key message with this article is to always invest with your eyes wide open

142686,364201,ED,Safe Retirement Income With A 4  Dividend Yield,opinion,"Utility companies are far from exciting businesses  but their dependable cash flow  defensive characteristics  and typically reliable dividend payments can make them compelling stocks for investors living off dividends in retirement 
Consolidated Edison  N ED  possesses many characteristics that make it appealing to conservative dividend investors  The company has served the New York marketplace for more than 180 years and has grown its dividend for over 40 consecutive years  In fact  ED is the only utility company in the S P 500 with 30 or more years of consecutive dividend increases
Business OverviewED provides electric service to about 3 7 million customers and gas service to approximately 1 2 milliion customers mostly in New York City  ED is mainly a distribution company and has little power generation activities  and the far majority of its income is derived from regulated activities 
ED also plays a meaningful role in the renewable energy market  The company is the 6th largest owner and operator of solar PV in North America  behind Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKa   Sunedison Inc  N SUNE   SolarCity Corporation  O SCTY   NRG Energy Inc  N NRG   and had 446 megawatts of solar and wind projects in operation at the end of 2014 Business AnalysisMany utility companies operate like monopolies in local or regional markets where it would be too costly to have multiple competitors offering electricity services  There are also few substitutes for electricity  and customers have historically had little to no choice over which supplier they receive service from and the price they pay 
Barriers to entry are generally high for several reasons  Maintaining transmission infrastructure to move electricity and gas from power plants to customers is extremely capital intensive and demands chronic maintenance and repair  For example  ED invests over  2 billion per year into its systems to remain competitive  In addition to cost  new entrants would need to obtain consent from the state authority  meet various safety and service standards  install transmission facilities to provide the service  comply with ongoing state regulations  and more 
Furthermore  following a wave of utility industry restructuring in the 1990s  all of the electric and gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by just four investor owned utility companies or one of two state authorities  Given the local   regional nature of the business and the high amount of government regulation  it seems unlikely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery services where ED already has a presence 
Finally  the pace of change in the utility sector has historically been very slow  Much of the core technology developed for transmission lines has remained stable for decades  More recently  attention has increasingly focused on efficiency upgrades  e g  the smart grid  and preparing for wider adoption of renewable energy sources  e g  solar  Key RisksDespite the competitive advantages enjoyed by utility companies  they face several important limitations that serve to restrict their growth and profitability 
Traditional monopoly companies typically demonstrate strong pricing power  However  as most income investors know  maximum retail prices charged by regulated utilities are set by state governments  This limits the profitability a utility can enjoy and can significantly impact profitability  However  it does provide them a guaranteed rate of return  in most cases  
Given the capital intensity of transmission infrastructure and the government s interest in keeping electricity prices reasonable for consumers  utilities typically earn a relatively low but stable return on equity 
Income investors should be aware of government regulations in the key states that a utility company operates in  Some areas are much friendlier than others  and rate policies can change over time 
If utilities receive unfavorable rate increases  they might be unable to offset cost increases they incur  Given their high debt loads  this can be a big deal  For example  during 2009  Moody s downgraded ED s credit rating by two notches after the company experienced a series of unfavorable rate cases 
Most recently  ED received news that  for the third year in a row  The high cost of living in New York probably doesn t help the case to push rates higher each year  While it s disappointing to not get a rate increase and puts more pressure on 2017  we think the company remains in good shape 
Overall  New York s regulatory system has generally been consistent and reasonable over the years  Importantly  it includes revenue decoupling for electric and gas services  This means that the utility company s profits are disassociated from its sales of the energy commodity itself  In other words  rates are adjusted up or down to help the utility meet a targeted rate of return regardless of how much product is sold 
Looking longer term  renewable energy sources will continue to impact the utility sector  For example  New York targets 50  renewable energy by 2030  twice the amount installed in the state today 
Finally  it s worth mentioning that most utility companies will continue to deal with  in the U S   energy efficiency  and a desire by customers to find cheaper  cleaner energy  including renewables  If customers are able to increasingly generate their own electricity  e g  solar panels   it could take away sales from utilities and lead to higher costs for other customers 
We believe ED is better protected from this risk compared to other utilities because of its substantial investment in solar  6th largest operator in North America  and presence in New York City  wind farm activity is severely limited   We hope the renewables market will develop to allow utilities to own the renewable energy sources on behalf of customers rather than handing over more control to third parties  but we will continue to watch for new developments Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
ED earned a very strong dividend Safety Score of 78  suggesting its dividend payment is very secure  The company s payout ratio is reasonable  it generates consistent cash flow  and its business is protected by government regulations 
Over the last four quarters  ED s earnings payout ratio is 70   While this would be risky for cyclical companies  it is reasonable for a stable utility company like ED 
Looking below  we can see that ED s earnings payout ratio has remained between 60  and 70  most years  in line with management s target Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Not surprisingly  we can see that ED performed well during the financial crisis  Sales fell by 4  in 2009  and operating margins actually improved  While demand for electricity drops a little during economic slowdowns  it is still an essential need for consumers and businesses Source  Simply Safe Dividends
As we previously mentioned  ED s profitability is determined by state authorities  which determine rate increases and an acceptable return on capital for utility companies  For this reason  we can see that ED s return on equity has remained very stable at 9 10  over the last decade Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking at the balance sheet  ED maintains a lot of debt relative to its cash on hand  With that said  utilities have been able to maintain more debt than an average business because their cash flow generation is so consistent  The company has reasonable credit ratings with S P and Fitch Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  it s worth mentioning that ED suspended its dividend in 1974  which was the first time since 1885 that the company omitted its quarterly dividend 
Why did this happen  At the time  ED was much more involved in power generation and relied heavily on various fuels for its generating facilities  The price of residual oil unexpectedly quadrupled  crimping profitability  Management also made a few executional missteps  and ED was heavily dependent on capital markets to finance its ongoing operations  Investor confidence in utility companies plunged 
We don t view this as a risk today  ED is not involved in electricity power generation  only distribution   but it s worth mentioning  Altogether  we believe ED s dividend payment is very safe Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
ED s dividend Growth Score was 9  suggesting its growth potential is very low  As a mature utility company with a 70  payout ratio and limited earnings growth opportunities  this shouldn t come as a surprise 
As seen below  the company s dividend has grown between 1  and 2  per year over the last decade  Despite the low growth rate  ED is on  and has raised its dividend for 41 consecutive years  the third longest streak in the electric utility industry  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Since ED s EPS payout ratio  70   is at the upper end of management s target  60  to 70    we expect future dividend growth to track earnings growth and remain in the low single digit range ValuationED trades at 16x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 4   which is a little below its five year average dividend yield  4 26   
With future earnings growth likely in the 2 4  range  the stock s total return potential would appear to be 6  to 8  per year  For retirees and conservative income investors concerned with capital preservation  we believe ED appears to be reasonably priced 
ConclusionED is one of the most reliable utility companies that conservative income investors can find  With an operating history going back more than 180 years and over 40 straight years of dividend increases  ED has proven to be very durable and committed to its dividend 
The utility sector is being forced to evolve as renewable energy markets enjoy rapid growth  but ED appears to be reasonably positioned for this trend  recall that ED is the 6th largest owner and operator of solar PV in North America   We think the bigger risk is future electricity rates allowed by New York s public utility commission ",2015-12-30,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/safe-retirement-income-with-a-4-dividend-yield-378225,378225
142687,364202,ED,When The Lights Go Down,opinion,"For market bulls  it s been tough to get excited about stocks so far this year 
Last Friday  the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in correction territory  And the S P 500 Index booked the  for a year in history  finishing down 6  
The bears have certainly come out of their caves  proclaiming this lengthy bull market to finally be at an end  If you re feeling rather ursine yourself and want to get short the market  here s where you want to be 
Desperate Times   Desperate Measures 
In 2009  the Federal Reserve adopted its zero interest rate policy  ZIRP  to spur economic growth in the wake of 2008 s devastating financial meltdown 
Since then  yield starved investors have latched onto dividend stocks  particularly the defensive utilities sector 
These stocks pay better dividends and experience lower volatility than the broader market  But with rates so low  many utility firms borrowed heavily to upgrade their aging infrastructures  Today  an alarming number of these companies are leveraged up to their eyeballs 
As interest rates rise  profit margins will go down  and the cost of servicing debt will go up   and that means things are about to get ugly for utilities as we head into the latest interest rate hike cycle 
Among the victims will likely be the renowned Dividend Aristocrat  Consolidated Edison Inc  N ED  
Founded in 1884  Con Edison is one America s oldest utility companies  It delivers regulated electric  gas  and steam to customers across the state of New York 
At the start of the ZIRP era  the company offered a fatter yield than both the S P 500 and the benchmark 10 Year Treasury notes  Shares also outperformed the broad market from the latter half of 2008 to 2013 
But by 2013  Con Edison  along with its industry peers  had begun to lag the large cap index considerably  And today  the stock appears prohibitively expensive 
The Devil Is in the Details
Because of the mad defensive rush into ED  the company s forward yield dropped to 3 9   compared to an average of 4 8  for its peers 
Shares currently trade at 16 2 times forward earnings  a 30  premium to its peers and a 10  premium to Con Edison s 10 year median of 14 7 
Meanwhile  the company trades at more than nine times the enterprise value  EV  to forward EBITDA   a whopping 59  premium to peers 
EV is the sum of market capitalization and total debt  and this growing figure reflects a ballooning debt load  currently at  12 billion  that s outpacing revenue growth 
Finally  Con Edison also trades at an 85  premium to peers on a price to forward cash flow basis  And speaking of cash  the company s free cash flow has plunged 65  since 2011 
The near term technical view on the stock isn t any prettier 
Con Edison s RSI is quickly approaching the overbought threshold  Shares also just bounced down from the major trend line resistance 

But the real damage is yet to be done  As the Fed hikes interest rates  income investors will flock from Con Edison to  safer  assets such as Treasuries and investment grade bonds 
And even if the Fed delays further rate rises and the market rallies  the stock will likely continue to underperform the market 
Thus  it s time to take the short side on these shares ahead of the imminent investor exodus

142688,364203,ED,Williams Co  Stands Alone At The Altar  Crestwood Delevers And Soars,opinion,"Williams Companies Stands Alone at the Altar
The Energy Transfer Williams deal continues to be a rich source of intrigue and fascinating machinations  Sometimes a target company will try and get out of an agreement to sell itself so as to join with a more eager suitor  But it s not often that an acquirer has second thoughts  and reading through a recent SEC by Energy Transfer reveals a blow by blow account of the frequent discussions of the William board as they considered their options 
As long ago as February 2014  Energy Transfer Equity  NYSE ETE  CEO Kelcy Warren had reached out to Williams Companies  NYSE WMB  CEO Alan Armstrong to discuss a combination  Armstrong was initially lukewarm and from the looks of it never became enthusiastic  even voting against the combination when it was finally considered by the WMB board in September 2015 
The  Background to the Merger  is in a section of a made  ironically  by Energy Transfer Corp  ETC   an entity created specifically to acquire WMB shares at closing but which for now is doing little more than posting SEC filings  Although ETC is currently controlled by ETE  its filing includes a methodical recital of the WMB board s consideration of ETE s offer as well as other competing proposals  Indeed  as the negotiations reached a conclusion WMB insisted on severely limiting ETE s ability to walk away from the transaction  WMB sought to tighten the  material adverse effect  language that is commonly used and which allows a party to cancel a proposed transaction for no penalty in the event that a major surprise upsets the original economics  Kelcy Warren had pursued WMB for almost two years  and having finally succumbed to their eager paramour the WMB board was intent on making the deal stick 

Buyer s remorse followed with indecent haste  see    Within months ETE s CFO Jamie Welch was reported to be privately lobbying WMB shareholders to press for modified deal terms  since the  6BN cash payment agreed to by ETE was weighing on the stock price 
In fact  the performance of both stocks has been disastrous since the deal was announced  since the new ETC stock with which WMB investors would be paid was to be linked to collapsing ETE  thereby diminishing the value of the sale  It became obvious why ETE wanted out   less clear why WMB insisted on completing a transaction whose value had disintegrated 
In May of 2015 ETE s proposal to WMB had valued the stock at  64  By March of 2016 the prospect of the deal closing had dragged WMB down to  15  By then  Kelcy Warren had fired his CFO  who has sued  and gone nuclear in his efforts to get the deal changed or cancelled  ETE made a possibly illegal and certainly unethical move when they issued preferred equity only to insiders on preferential terms  thus devaluing the currency WMB investors would receive in the transaction  and drawing a WMB lawsuit  
In case ETE s distaste for the transaction wasn t already clear  they subsequently posted an SEC filing slashing the originally expected  2BN in annual commercial synergies to only  170MM  For good measure they added that the combined company s presence at WMB s current headquarters in Tulsa  OK would be substantially reduced 
At this stage both stocks are attractively valued if they remain separate  So it s interesting to learn how comparatively easy it is for the deal to be broken if the acquirer doesn t wish to proceed  The merger arb funds and the journalists who bet on a closing missed this   reported on March 4th that    the company s options appear to be severely limited  
With respect to breaking the deal  last week s S 4 from Energy Transfer Corp noted that their tax counsel might not be able to deliver a needed tax opinion in time  a necessary condition for closing  One can imagine that if the acquirer doesn t want to proceed  and an affirmative tax opinion is required from its legal counsel  it shouldn t be difficult to delay or even fail to obtain such an opinion  Originally WMB didn t want to be bought and ETE gave chase  Having finally been caught  WMB desires consummation while ETE claims its earlier passion has gone 
WMB is at the altar while ETE nurses the mother of all hangovers in a hotel  Did they find each other on Match com  In this upside down world of love professed  only to be returned unrequited  it must be difficult for WMB to press a damages claim  Since the abovementioned filing cast further doubt on the deal WMB s stock has risen  In any event  on June 28th either party can simply walk away  For Kelcy Warren that date probably can t come quickly enough  The next target of his affections may run a little faster 
Crestwood Delevers and Soars
On Thursday Crestwood Equity Partners  NYSE CEQP  announced a joint venture with Con Edison  NYSE ED  which placed a 13X EBITDA multiple on the part of CEQP that was rolled into the JV and allowed them to use cash proceeds from the deal to reduce leverage  It was another example of public market equity prices underpricing the value that other energy sector investors assess to be present  Although CEQP jumped over 50   we believe it s still attractively priced with a 14  yield following a distribution cut  1 6X distribution coverage and leverage dropping to The Math of a Distribution Financed Buyback 
Sell Side Shockers
Meanwhile  MLPs have since February kicked off the casket lid and leapt up  showing vigorous signs of life  Many formerly wealthy MLP investors who hung on are no doubt relieved to be restored from potential mobile home dwellers to at least the category of mass affluent  Sell side coverage of the sector is becoming more cautiously constructive  buoyed by the Alerian Index finally reaching positive territory year to date  We came across one amusing recommendation from a clearly overworked analyst whose bosses evidently decided to issue an emergency research piece initiating coverage on MLPs  The hapless analyst breathlessly rates Columbia Pipeline  NYSE CPGX   Market Perform   failing to consider TransCanada s  TO TRP  recently agreed acquisition of CPGX for  25 50 in an all cash deal  So regardless of how the market performs CPGX is going to  25 50  The same analyst thinks WMB investors will suffer a 50  dividend cut if the merger with Energy Transfer goes through  overlooking the 1 5274X ETE exchange ratio they ll receive for their WMB shares  Who says sell side research isn t worth reading

142689,364204,ED,TECO Energy  TE  Q1 Earnings  Can The Stock Surprise ,opinion,"Diversified energy company  TECO Energy  Inc    NYSE TE   is scheduled to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company reported an earnings surprise of 0 00   Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter 
Factors to Consider
TECO Energy has been gaining traction on the back of a rising customer count  In fact  the company has consistently added customers over the last several quarters  TECO energy expects this customer growth trend to continue in 2016 as well  Increasing employment opportunities and the roll out of the new single family building permits  backed by a gradual recovery in the Florida economy  are expected to further boost demand for utility services 
However  earnings at the company tend to fluctuate with weather variations in its service territories  Warmer than expected temperatures during last winter could hurt demand for utility services and in turn  affect the performance of the company 
We remind investors that the planned acquisition of TECO Energy by Emera Inc  remains on track to close in mid 2016  subject to the approval of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission   NMPRC    On the other hand  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  has already approved the acquisition in January 
Surprise History

The above chart indicates that TECO Energy was not able to beat earnings estimates in any of the last four quarters  The average earnings surprise was 0 00  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that TECO Energy will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 27 cents 
Zacks Rank  Though TECO Energy s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a few operators in Utility Electric Power space worth considering on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Consolidated Edison  Inc    NYSE ED   has an Earnings ESP of   0 82  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to report earnings on May 5

142712,364227,ED,A Cheap Funds Is Not Necessarily A Good Fund,opinion,"Fund holdings affect fund performance more than fees or past performance  A cheap fund is not necessarily a good fund  A fund that has done well in the past is not likely to do well in the future  e g  5 star kiss of death and active management has long history of underperformance   Yet  traditional fund research focuses only on low fees and past performance 
Our research on holdings enables investors to find funds with high quality holdings   AND   low fees 
Investors are good at picking cheap funds  We want them to be better at picking funds with good stocks  Both are required to maximize success  We make this easy with our predictive fund ratings  A fund s predictive rating is based on its holdings and its total costs  and how it ranks when compared to the rest of the 7000  ETFs and mutual funds we cover 
Figure 1 shows that 65  of fund assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with low costs but only 1  of assets are in ETFs and mutual funds with Attractive holdings  This discrepancy is astounding 
Figure 1  Allocation of Fund Assets By Holdings Quality and By Costs
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Two key shortcomings in the ETF and mutual fund industry cause this large discrepancy 
A lack of research into the quality of holdings 
Not enough research focuses on the quality of Portfolio Management of funds

A lack of high quality holdings or good stocks 
With about twice as many funds as stocks in the market  there simply are not enough good stocks to fill all the funds 

These shortcomings are related  If investors had more insight into the quality of funds  holdings  I think they would allocate a lot less money to funds with poor quality holdings  Many funds would cease to exist 
Investors deserve research on the quality of stocks held by ETFs and mutual funds 
Quality of holdings is the single most important factor in determining an ETF or mutual fund s future performance  No matter how low the costs  if the ETF or mutual fund holds bad stocks  performance will be poor  Costs are easy to find but research on the quality of holdings is almost non existent 
Figure 2 shows investors are not putting enough money into ETFs and mutual funds with high quality holdings  Only 49 of 7267  1  of assets  ETFs and mutual funds allocate a significant amount of value to quality holdings  99  of assets are in funds that do not justify their costs and over charge investors for poor portfolio management 
Figure 2  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Portfolio Management Rating
Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Figure 3 shows that investors successfully find cheap funds  65  of assets are held in ETFs and mutual funds that have Attractive or better rated Total Annual Costs  my apples to apples measure of the all in cost of investing in any given fund 
Out of the 7267 ETFs and mutual funds I cover  1428  65  of all assets  earn an Attractive or better Total Annual Costs rating 
Clearly  ETF and mutual funds investors are smart shoppers when it comes to finding cheap investments  But cheap is not necessarily good 
Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF  FUTY  is one of many funds with low costs but a Very Dangerous Portfolio Management rating  It gets an overall predictive rating of Very Dangerous because no matter how low its fees  I expect it to underperform because it holds too many  78   Dangerous or worse rated stocks  Low fees cannot boost fund performance  Only good stocks can boost performance 
One of the Dangerous or worse rated stocks held by FUTY is Dominion Resources  Inc   D   to which it allocates over 6  of its value  The company has long term declining after tax profit  NOPAT   a return on invested capital  ROIC  in the bottom quintile of all companies I cover  and an expensive valuation  To justify its current price of   68 share  D must grow NOPAT by 9  compounded annually for the next 11 years  Not many utilities are capable of such high  sustained profit growth  Similar to many of its peers  D s high dividend masks the fact that its cash flows cannot support its lofty valuation 
Out of the 78 stocks held by FUTY  only 2 earn my Attractive or better rating  Those two companies are Consolidated Edison  Inc   NYSE ED  and Otter Tail Corp  NASDAQ OTTR   FUTY s fund manager would be better suited to allocate more capital to stocks such as these as opposed to the 2 55  and 0 14  allocations  to ED and OTTR respectively 
Figure 3  Distribution of ETFs   Mutual Funds  Count   Assets  By Total Annual Costs Ratings
Source  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Investors should allocate their capital to funds with both high quality holdings and low costs because those are the funds that offer investors the best performance potential 
But they do not  Not even close 
Investors deserve forward looking ETF and mutual fund research that assesses both costs and quality of holdings  For example  iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF  QUAL  is a fund with both low costs  0 17   and a Very Attractive Portfolio Management rating 
One of the good stocks held by QUAL is Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ gets my Attractive rating due to its increasing economic earnings  top quintile ROIC  and cheap valuation  At its current valuation of   100 share  JNJ has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 2  This ratio implies that the company s NOPAT will grow by only 20  from current levels over the remaining life of the corporation  This expectation seems awfully low given that JNJ has grown NOPAT consistently by 8  compounded annually over the past decade  Heavy allocation to stocks such as JNJ makes QUAL a Very Attractive fund 
Why is the most popular fund rating system based on backward looking past performance 
I do not know  but I do know that the lack of transparency into the quality of portfolio management provides cover for the ETF and mutual fund industry to continue to over charge investors for poor portfolio management  How else could they get away with selling nearly 74 times more Dangerous or worse ETFs and mutual funds than Attractive or better 
John Bogle is correct   investors should not pay high fees for active portfolio management  His index funds have provided investors with many cheap alternatives to actively managed funds 
However  by focusing entirely on costs  he overlooks the primary driver of fund performance  the stocks held by funds  Investors also need to beware certain Index Label Myths 
Research on the quality of portfolio management of funds empower empowers investors to make better investment decisions  Investors should no longer pay for poor portfolio management

Cerner  Ticker  CERN
Cerner   NASDAQ CERN   has been moving steadily higher since making a low in May  At the end of October it broke above the February high and has been consolidating there since  with the Bollinger Bands  now tightening 
Capital One Financial  Ticker  COF
Capital One Financial  NYSE COF   had one failed attempt to move over the resistance zone in September  It is back at that zone though  from a higher low and with the Bollinger Bands  tightening  Both the RSI and MACD are also rising   supporting a break higher 
Consolidated Edison  Ticker  ED
Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  broke higher from a slow rising consolidation in October  Since the start of November it consolidated that move in a falling wedge  before breaking that to the upside Friday  The RSI is turning back up and held in the bullish zone on the pullback  while the MACD is leveling after its pullback 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals  Ticker  JAZZ
Jazz Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ JAZZ   is breaking a year long ascending triangle pattern to the upside  The target on the pattern break takes the price to 240 over time  The RSI is rising and in the bullish zone while the MACD is about to cross up  giving a buy signal 
Johnson Controls  Ticker  JCI
Johnson Controls  NYSE JCI   is approaching a triple top as the Bollinger bands are tightening for a price move  The RSI is pulling back from an overbought condition while the MACD has crossed down  both support a reversal lower  Watch this both ways  for a break out or a failure 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  as the calendar turns to December sees the Equity markets showing signs of divergence or rotation but with continued strength  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower  resuming its downtrend while Crude Oil also continues lower  The US Dollar Index and US Treasuries look strong though and are biased to continue to the upside  The Shanghai Composite is also strong and looks to continue higher while Emerging Markets are consolidating in what may be a bearish pattern  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show continued strength in the QQQ  with the SPY a bit stretched short term but looking good on the intermediate timeframe  while the IWM continues to consolidate in the longer consolidation range  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

142714,364229,ED,Will Cheap Oil Dethrone Natural Gas ,opinion,"From heating homes to fueling vehicles  natural gas has been making strong inroads over the past decade 
In fact  when oil prices were high  the cost of operating a truck on diesel fuel was as much as 60  more than the cost of operating the same vehicle on natural gas 
Clean Energy Fuels  NASDAQ CLNE  jumped on the opportunity provided by the gap and built a plethora of dry and liquid natural gas facilities across the country 
Now that oil is cheap  however  the difference has narrowed substantially  to around 30  The effect on CLNE s shares has been quite pronounced  Shares were down more than 60  since December 2013  But don t sell your natural gas shares just yet  The fuel s inherent qualities are standing up to the  Black Beast  
In Your House and on the Road
The movement towards natural gas is most evident when it comes to heating and transportation 
When oil prices were at  100 and heating oil prices were above  4 50 per gallon  it cost twice as much to warm an oil heated home than one using natural gas  With the record breaking winter we had last year  oil heat homeowners were looking at their natural gas neighbors with envy  That gap has narrowed as oil prices have plunged  but natural gas powered heat is still cheaper 
There are other benefits besides price  too  Unlike heating oil  which is delivered  natural gas is always  on   And oil furnaces tend to leave a less than desired smell wherever a furnace is located 
Ultimately  though  it s the cost benefit that counts  Oil prices might be lower today  but history shows that natural gas tends to be consistently cheaper over time and less subject to shocks  outside of short term issues related to weather 
Oil  on the other hand  is impacted by everything from weather to politics 8 000 miles away 
On the transportation side  as oil prices continue to drop  truck engine manufacturers may pull back on their production of natural gas engines  However  they won t simply stop production That s because the current fleets of natural gas powered vehicles   such as those used by Waste Management  NYSE WM   UPS  NYSE UPS   and Federal Express  NYSE FDX    can t just switch back to gasoline or diesel 
The natural gas revolution isn t restricted to households or trucking  either 

Moving to the Big City

Con Ed  NYSE ED   the giant utility that provides energy for a good chunk of New York City  has noted that more large buildings are switching to natural gas  Through October 2014  more than 1 249 large buildings made the switch 
In all of 2013  they reported 1 293 switches  Over the past two years  the amount of buildings converting to gas has increased from 108 per month to 125 
New systems are extremely expensive to install  but from a financial point of view  the payback is much shorter  We re talking as short as five to seven years at  100 per barrel oil and  4 per thousand cubic feet  mcf  gas 
At current levels  the payback period may extend out to 10 years  But from a long term perspective  that s still a heck of a return  as most large facilities consider outlooks in the decades  not just a few years  For consumers  the savings can be enhanced further as federal and state programs in many states offer rebates and no cost financing for equipment to switch to natural gas 
Oil prices may put a dent into the conversions in the short term  but the trend towards switching to natural gas remains intact  and that bodes well for the industry as a whole  Bottom line  Natural gas prices have plunged in 2014  down to around  3 1 per mcf  they stayed around  4 per mcf for most of the year   but not as much as oil prices  And just like lower oil prices  lower natural gas prices will stimulate demand   which  in turn  will raise prices 
Plus  the equation for converting natural gas infrastructure for use with oil is much too complicated  even with oil prices down more than 50  in 2014

142717,364232,ED,Johnson   Johnson  53 Years Of Low Risk Dividend Growth,opinion,"Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  was founded in 1886  Since that time  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  has grown to become the largest health care business in the world 
The company has a market cap of  276 7 billion  generates over  70 billion a year in sales  and  16 billion a year in profits 
You may have heard about the 3 most important aspects of real estate   location  location  location  Johnson   Johnson has its own 3 most important aspects   stability  stability  stability  Johnson   Johnson is perhaps the most stable  blue chip  dividend growth stock investment around today  The company s  page gives a few amazing statistics about the companies consistency 

 Our consistent performance has enabled us to deliver an exceptional track record of growth that few  if any  companies can claim  31 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases and 53 consecutive years of dividend increases  

There is a lot of  well deserved  discussion about the 52 Dividend Aristocrats   stocks that have paid increasing dividends for 25 or more consecutive years  Johnson   Johnson is a Dividend Aristocrat twice over 
Johnson   Johnson is a member of a far more exclusive group  the  gold standard  of dividend stocks  Johnson   Johnson is a Dividend King  Dividend Kings are stocks with 50  consecutive years of dividend increases  The image below shows the company s dividend growth history 

Johnson   Johnson s stock price standard deviation shows just how stable and respected the business is  The company has a stock price standard deviation over the last decade of just 16 2   This is the lowest of any large cap stock in the Sure Dividend database  The next two lowest are utilities  Southern Company  NYSE SO  and Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED  have long term stock price standard deviations of 17 8  and 16 7   respectively  Johnson   Johnson s stock is less volatile than even high quality utilities 
Business Overview   Competitive Advantage
The secret to Johnson   Johnson s stability is its wide diversification within the health care industry  The company operates in 3 segments  Consumer  Pharmaceutical  and Medical Devices  The image below shows the relative size of each segment for Johnson   Johnson 

If one segment has a  down  quarter   and by down I mean being slightly less profitable  not losing money   then it is likely that another segment is outperforming  Johnson   Johnson s diversification within the health care industry helps give it such stable cash flows 
A stock must have a strong competitive advantage  or several  to realize positive earnings growth for 31 consecutive years  and positive dividend growth for over 50 years  Johnson   Johnson s has 3 broad competitive advantages that differentiate it from its competitors 
Size scale competitive advantage
Research   development competitive advantage
Brand competitive advantage
Johnson   Johnson s size scale competitive advantage is a result of it being the largest player in the health care industry  The company s long history gives it excellent connections with suppliers and governments around the world  The company can keep input costs low by buying in far larger quantities than competitors can 
The company s large size gives it a bigger research and development budget that its peers  The company spent an industry leading  8 5 billion on research and development in 2014  and another  8 billion in 2013  This spending has produced tangible results  Johnson   Johnson generates about 25  of revenue from products it has developed in the last 5 years  The company s pharmaceutical portfolio in particular is benefitting from large research and development spending  as the image below shows 

Johnson   Johnson commands premium pricing through its well known consumer brands  The company owns the following well known consumer health brands  among others  
Tylenol
Band Aid
Zyrtec
Listerine
Johnson s
Neutrogena
Aveeno
Motrin
The company supports its consumer brands and pharmaceuticals with large advertising spending  In 2014  Johnson   Johnson spent  2 6 billion on advertising  The company spent  2 5 billion in 2013 
Current Events   Growth Prospects
Johnson   Johnson posted 6 7  constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth in its   The company has grown earnings per share at 6 1  a compound rate of 6 1  a year over the last decade  Recent results were in line with historical average growth   just what one would expect from a highly stable business 
Going forward  Johnson   Johnson s biggest growth driver will likely be its pharmaceutical segment  Pharmaceutical sales have grown at 13 1  a year from 2012 through 2014  Johnson   Johnson s large research and development spending will drive further growth in the pharmaceutical division 
Financial pundits have been calling for the breakup of Johnson   Johnson recently  Spin offs are typically good for shareholders  If the company were to split into three smaller businesses  one for each segment   it is difficult to say whether shareholders would be better served or not 
Those who wanted to own the  whole business  could still do so by not selling any of the three spin off companies  Those who want to focus just on Johnson   Johnson s faster growing pharmaceutical segment  or more stable consumer segment  could do so  In the final analysis  a split up would probably be beneficial for shareholders in the long run  but is not in any way necessary to make Johnson   Johnson an excellent investment choice 
Valuation   Final Thoughts
Johnson   Johnson currently trades for an adjusted price to earnings ratio of 16 6  The company appears somewhat undervalued at current prices  The company has a 3  dividend yield and should grow earnings per share at around 5  to 7  a year going forward  for total returns between 8  and 10  a year 
Total returns of 8  to 10  a year mean Johnson   Johnson offers investors returns that are around the S P 500 s long term historical average of 9  a year  The difference is  Johnson   Johnson is an incredibly stable business with an extremely low stock price volatility  Simply put  Johnson   Johnson offers investors market matching returns with lower risk 
An investment that offers similar returns to the overall market  but with less risk should trade at or above the price to earnings multiple of the S P 500  The S P 500 is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 21 1  versus 16 6 for Johnson   Johnson  This is why Johnson   Johnson appears undervalued at current prices 
Johnson   Johnson s combination of a 3  dividend yield  solid total return potential  long history of success  and an extremely low stock price volatility make it a Top 25 stock  The company makes an intriguing investment for risk averse investors looking for growing income ",2015-08-06,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/johnson---johnson:-53-years-of-low-risk-dividend-growth-260796,260796
