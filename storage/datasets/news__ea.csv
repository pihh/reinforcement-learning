157351,378867,EA,3 Things Under the Radar This Week,news,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan 
Investing com   Wild market swings came this week as a Black Swan swooped down on 2020 in the form of the coronavirus 
That lent an extra edge of volatility to what was the busiest week of earnings for the season  which also had a Fed decision a Bank of England decision  U S  GDP and the U K  officially leaving the EU  It s not surprising some things may have gone unnoticed 
While stocks were still diving on Friday  investment banks were betting on a white knight to fix the economic ramifications of the coronavirus 
Telsa had another stellar week  but is there one area out its control that could stifle the stock 
And investors shouldn t ignore the big game this weekend 
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week 
1  In the Fed We Trust
A deadly disease emanating from Wuhan  China rocked global markets to the core this week  The S P 500 turned negative for the month  The CBOE Volatility Index  or fear index  spiked to three month highs  And safe havens like gold and bonds rode the wave of fear to sharp weekly gains 
In the wake of the rising coronavirus risk  some on Wall Street have warned that a 5  to 10  correction beckons for stock markets  But they appear reluctant to wave the white flag on the decade long bull run in equities  claiming the Federal Reserve will save the day 
If China s economy comes under heavy siege from the virus  its 18  weight in the global economy would have an overwhelmingly negative effect on the rest of the global economy   and likely call the Fed into action    Societe Generale    PA SOGN  said in a note 
  Morgan Stanley    NYSE MS  agreed  saying the Fed won t allow an accelerated slump in stocks as  liquidity remains flush  
But Societe Generale is still not keen to wade into beaten down stocks 
 In our view  it is too early to call a generalized  buy the dips   given the newsflow on the virus is currently anything but reassuring   it said 
J P  Morgan is a little more daring 
 The latest health scare is likely to worsen before getting better   but  past outbreaks have tended to drive only limited market falls   J P  Morgan said  
These previous health scares did not lead to a prolonged period of selling  and were a  buying opportunity within weeks   it added 
2  Can Anything Stall Tesla 
It was quite a week for Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   which seems it can do no wrong at the moment 
It knocked its earnings out of the park  sending the high flying stock still higher  On Friday  during the massive selloff on coronavirus fears  it ended 1 5  higher  even though its Shanghai factory could be impacted  CEO Elon Musk even dropped an EDM song entitled  Don t Doubt ur Vibe  
Is there any fly in Tesla s ointment  Perhaps one is the attitude of governments towards electric vehicle subsidies 
Around the globe  the message looks mixed 

In the U S   Tesla hit the cap of 200 000 vehicles that was set for a  7 500 consumer tax break in 2019 and Congress declined to extend the cap to 600 000 vehicles 

In China  Beijing plans to end its new energy vehicle  NEV  subsidies after 2020  but said it would not cut subsidies again this summer  which the auto industry saw as a win 
In Norway  where electric cars make up more than 40  of sales  VAT exemptions have been extended to the end of 2021 
In Germany  Tesla s lower priced Model 3s are subsidized with a grant of 4 000 euros that the government plans to increase by half over the five years from 2020 
In Canada  the Model 3 can get a rebate of up to C 5 000 under the zeo emission incentive program 

In the U K  all Tesla models are eligible for a rebate od up to 3 500 pounds 

3  What s the Super Bowl to the S P 
It s Super Bowl LIV weekend and while U S  investors may know the connection to equities  the Super Bowl Indicator may have flown under the radar for global traders  especially considering all the other big headlines 
The Super Bowl Indicator says that if a team from the NFC wins the big game there will be bull market that year and if the AFC team wins  there will be a bear market   It s quite straightforward if you don t get too hung up on expansion teams arising after the 1970 NFL AFL merger and teams switching conferences  
That means a win by the San Francisco 49ers will be good for stocks and a Kansas City Chiefs win won t 
Noticed in 1978 by a New York Times sports writer and popularized by market newsletter  this coincidental correlation still gets attention as it s been mostly right 
Through 53 Super Bowls  in 79  of years when the NFC has won  stocks have ended the year up 
But it s been wrong the last four games 
For the real gamblers who can t even wait for the big game  videogame maker Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  ran its game simulation on  Madden NFL 20   with the Chiefs taking the Vince Lombardi trophy home  beating the Niners 35 31 
And for those who don t like sports  there s the classic January Indicator that says as goes the first month  so goes the year  Friday s big selloff pushed the S P 500 just into the red for the month ",2020-02-01,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-2073583,2073583
157352,378868,EA,2 Reasons Electronic Arts Stock Could Soar Over the Next Five Years,news,"Over the last five years  shares of Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  have doubled in value  and it could double again over the next five  There are a few reasons why I believe Electronic Arts could experience tremendous earnings growth with the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft launching this fall 
Before we get to those reasons  let s first look at how EA performed around the previous console transition six years ago 

Using history as a guide
The launch of the PS4 and Xbox One in 2013 turned out to be enormously beneficial for EA  The stock more than tripled between the end of calendar 2012 and 2014  fueled by strong growth in EA s digital sales  including live services and mobile games  
Since fiscal 2013  or about six months before the launch of the PS4 and Xbox One  EA revenue has increased only 42  cumulatively  But earnings and free cash flow have soared  which has fueled a rapid rise in the stock price over the past six years  
The advance on the bottom line was due to margin improvement  as the growing demand for digital game downloads pushed margins higher  Digital sales now make up about three quarters of EA s business  
On one hand  an argument can be made that EA s margin improvement story is mostly over  and future earnings growth may not advance as strongly as it did over the past five years  but I think earnings can continue to grow at double digit rates and fuel another run in the stock price 
Here are two reasons EA can get it done 
1  More platforms to sell games
Market researcher Newzoo expects the video game industry to continue growing through 2022  By that time  mobile and console game sales will comprise 80  of industry sales  
As it did six years ago  EA is currently working on new experiences in existing franchises  as well as new titles  to capitalize on the upcoming consoles  Management is particularly excited about releasing its next Battlefield title on  a larger installed base  of consoles in the next few years  
But EA s audience over the next five years will extend well beyond consoles  The game maker has a substantial growth opportunity in building its subscriptions business  which currently generates a small amount of revenue in the company s live services segment  
In October  EA announced a partnership with Steam  the widely used online PC game store  to offer EA Access subscriptions to Steam users  EA also launched EA Access on Playstation 4  This is part of the company s grand strategy  as CEO Andrew Wilson explained during the fiscal second quarter call   to reach more platforms in the near future   
Watch out for cloud gaming  This burgeoning market will allow gamers to play big budget titles    typically reserved for consoles    on any device  which will naturally expand the audience for gaming significantly 
When the technology is ready  EA should be well positioned with Project Atlas   As cloud gaming continues to develop  through Project Atlas  we are testing games streamed on public cloud infrastructure to ensure we are at the forefront of this developing space   Wilson told analysts during the company s October call  
The upcoming rollout of 5G cellular connection speeds could jump start the adoption of cloud gaming  Analysts expect the market for cloud gaming to grow 30  per year through 2025  
2  Investing in existing and new games
Nearly six years ago  during the last console transition  EA reported a significant jump in earnings growth for fiscal 2014 s fourth quarter  In that case  management credited the depth of its game lineup  its investment in digital services  and ability to keep costs down while still investing in key franchises 
EA is repeating that playbook this year  One of the reasons EA s stock has been moving higher recently is based on the strong momentum in live services  specifically with respect to Ultimate Team and Apex Legends  
Apex Legends is a popular battle royale shooter that was released a year ago and has reached a massive player base   Apex Legends is a major long term franchise for us   Wilson said during the second quarter call  He added   Since launch  we ve significantly expanded the team working on the game  and it continues to grow   EA credited strong growth from Apex Legends for its record revenue in live services during the fiscal third quarter  
The popularity of Apex is so strong that EA is taking advantage of that momentum to spend extra time on Battlefield 6 and the next NBA Live installment  Typically  these two franchises would see a release this year  but management believes the strength from its current lineup will be enough to keep revenue and earnings growing in the near term 
Additionally  EA has  plans for new experiences  that it hasn t announced yet  This includes  new titles and new  intellectual property  for multiple platforms    
Wilson made it clear that EA will be ready to sell plenty of games to new console buyers this year   Introducing new games will always be at our core  and we look forward to exciting players with unexpected new titles in fiscal 2021   
Room to run
The last five years saw in game spending emerge as a growth driver for EA  The next five years will likely see subscription revenue emerge as a significant contributor to the top line  With the stock still about 25  off its all time high from 2018  there is plenty of upside for this growth stock ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppunl,2073755
157353,378869,EA,EA Reaps Rewards From Its Wide Gaming Portfolio,news,"Investors pushed Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  stock returns well above the market in 2019 as the video game developer eased a few of shareholders  biggest worries  With the hit launch of Apex Legends  EA showed that it could adjust to shifting gamer preferences for new playing models  The company s established franchises fared well  too  with its sports brands helping capitalize on the stampede toward digital spending 
The fiscal third quarter  which ended on Dec  31  2019  is responsible for nearly 40  of EA s annual net bookings  though  and in its recent earnings report  the company showed that its positive momentum carried into that key selling period  With this big picture in mind  let s look at the latest operating results 

Robust growth
Net bookings  EA s core growth metric  jumped 23  year over year to modestly outpace management s targets  Among the key standout franchises was Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order  which is now on pace to sell around 10 million units in fiscal 2020 compared with executives  original forecast range of six million to eight million  Madden NFL 20 also posted a strong showing  setting a brand record for sales volumes even as pricing rose versus the prior year s iteration 
EA credited its live services channel with powering much of its digital growth with contributions from Apex Legends  FIFA  and Madden all helping push digital sales up to 77  of the business from 74  a year ago   Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services   CFO Blake Jorgensen said in a conference call 
On the downside  EA s mobile division continued to struggle  falling 6  for the quarter and 17  over the past 12 months  Management is hoping a packed pipeline of new releases will help turn that business around going forward 
Financial wins and outlook
EA notched several financial wins in the period with gross profit margin rising and operating expenses growing slowly  As a result  pre tax income is surging  reaching  1 billion over the past nine months compared with  800 million in the year ago period 
Executives were even more pleased with the tech stock s cash flow as operating cash hit a record  1 9 billion in calendar 2019  That figure is on track to rise total  1 7 billion in fiscal 2020  up from  1 5 billion the previous year 
The solid holiday season performance gave management confidence to lift a few core financial outlook targets  EA now sees revenue hitting  5 48 billion rather than the  5 41 billion it had predicted in late October  Cash flow and adjusted earnings targets each got significant upgrades  too 
Looking further out  the company expects more modest growth in fiscal 2021 as the industry transitions to the next generation of gaming consoles  Healthy demand for digitally delivered content and a release calendar of roughly eight major titles will support the business through that transitional period 
After that  EA is predicting that growth will accelerate in fiscal 2022 when it plans to release a new next gen installment of the Battlefield franchise  The good news is that EA s diverse portfolio means that investors won t have to put too much faith in any single title when judging whether the company can keep up its impressive growth ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq154,2073885
157354,378870,EA,Electronic Arts Posts Solid Earnings  but Shares Fall On Modest Guidance,news,"Video game studio Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  reported earnings last Thursday  The report  which covered the third quarter of EA s fiscal year 2020  exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines  but it came with a mixed guidance slate and EA s shares fell as much as 5 5  on Friday s trading session 
Electronic Arts  third quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Electronic Arts  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
The video game industry may have found a comfortable ratio between digital and physical sales for the holiday period  where something you can wrap might hold additional value  Digital sales rose 24  in the holiday themed third quarter  while packaged goods increased by a nearly identical 23   The revenue split between digital and physical sales stood at 71 29  unchanged from the year ago period  Digital sales accounted for a beefier 77  of total revenues over the last four quarters  up from 71  a year earlier 
Live services accounted for  677 million of top line revenues  a 41  year over year increase  Game downloads rose by 16  to  286 million and mobile game installations produced revenues of  161 million    an 11  decline from the year ago report 
Going beyond the numbers
EA launched three major games last quarter  led by Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order  Management pointed to the Star Wars title as a key driver of the quarter s significant revenue surprise 
The company also presented three new seasons of Apex Legends  which is EA s closest competitor to the Fortnite phenomenon and a leading title in EA s esports portfolio  This free to play game is monetized by in game payments for cosmetic upgrades such as new player models and weapons of different colors  This was the fastest growing revenue stream within EA s live services  Behind Apex  live services relied on solid growth in the FIFA soccer franchise and the Madden NFL football series 

What s next 
Looking ahead to the next quarter and the 2021 fiscal year  EA s management expects live services to continue delivering the company s highest growth rates  The upcoming launch of new gaming consoles from both Sony  NYSE SNE  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the second half of this calendar year should pave the way toward impressive gains in fiscal year 2022  EA plans to prime that pump with a new title in the colossal Battlefield series 
 Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games  and enable strong ongoing growth for our business   CEO Andrew Wilson said in EA s earnings call   Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas  New consoles are coming  and we ll be ready to lead with some of our top titles  
Fourth quarter net bookings are expected to land near  1 15 billion  yielding earnings in the neighborhood of  1 05 per share  That s a mixed forecast compared to Wall Street s consensus estimates  which are calling for earnings of roughly  0 97 per share on sales in the vicinity of  1 2 billion 
Is EA a buy right now 
There was no shortage of analysts raising their target prices on EA after this report  but these target increases generally landed no more than 10  above the stock s price at the end of Thursday s trading session  The stock is generally seen as fairly valued  trading at 12 times trailing earnings and 20 times free cash flows 
EA s share prices have nearly doubled over the last 5 years  but that return is only 15  above the S P 500 s dividend adjusted gains for the same period  One might argue that EA s stock is a reasonably accurate reflection of the broader market  albeit with wider swings and more volatility along the way  This stock does not excite me since there are so many top quality investment ideas with far brighter prospects on the market today ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq30x,2073929
157355,378871,EA,Electronic Arts Has Big Plans for  Apex Legends ,news,"Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  delivered results for the fiscal third quarter late last week that were much better than management had anticipated  One of the reasons for that was Apex Legends 
EA has big plans to build this popular battle royale title into a perennial shooter franchise  In fact  Apex is performing so well that it is allowing EA to spend an extra year working on the next Battlefield installment 
Management had plenty to say about Apex Legends and its long term potential on the latest conference call 

Apex contributed to a record quarter for live services
Lately  EA s primary focus has been growing its live services business  which includes revenue from in game spending  subscriptions  esports  and other items  Live services hit a new record during the holiday quarter  with revenue up 27  year over year to reach nearly  1 billion   Growth was led by Apex Legends  but closely followed by double digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams   COO Blake Jorgensen explained 
EA s sports titles are the largest component of live services revenue  but Apex Legends has the potential to grow into a substantial contributor to that business  too 
While it s uncertain whether Apex can match the enormous financial success of rival shooter Fortnite  which has made billions off of sales of virtual items sold to players in the game  management is making great progress in building a lucrative business around Apex Legends 
 The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game   Jorgensen said 
EA has  continued to bolster the  Apex Legends  team with new talent   especially in live services  The hard work is paying off  New content has been flowing at a regular pace  Management reported that the game s competitive season three saw growth over season two  with higher peaks in daily active users  
Management is sticking with its previous outlook that Apex Legends and The Sims 4 will bring in between  300 million and  400 million for fiscal 2020  which ends in March   While that s less than 10  of EA s annual revenue  management made it clear that this is just the beginning of what could be a 10 year franchise 
 People sometimes forget Ultimate Team was like an  8 million business 12 years ago   Jorgensen said  noting that Ultimate Team today generates nearly a third of EA s annual revenue   And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business  and that s how we re thinking about Apex   All said  investors shouldn t underestimate the moneymaking potential of this viral shooter 
The future of Apex Legends looks bright
Apex has performed much better than management expected when the game quietly launched about a year ago  This is certainly new territory for EA  known for its military based shooter Battlefield  which typically gets a new release every few years and directly competes with Activision Blizzard s Call of Duty  Apex Legends gives EA two major franchises to capture interest in the popular first person shooter genre 
During the call  management mentioned a few initiatives it is pursuing to expand Apex Legends  audience reach and allow for more moneymaking opportunities in the next few years 

EA is looking to put its games on more platforms during fiscal 2021  which ends in March   including Apex  The company is planning to launch Apex Legends on PC in China at some point  Plus  Jorgensen said there is  big upside  with the planned launch of a mobile version for Apex in that country  China is the world s largest gaming market 
EA is also excited about the prospects for Apex Legends on the esports scene  The Apex Legends Global Series is already underway and has attracted major brands as sponsors   We re pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming  joining Gillette  Snickers  Pizza Hut  and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio   CEO Andrew Wilson said 

Can Apex Legends power this growth stock to new highs  In the short term  it s unlikely  because Apex is not contributing enough revenue to the top line to register on investors  radar  But if the content updates and expansion in China are successful in getting more players engaged  Electronic Arts may have another  1 billion franchise on its hands down the road ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqf57,2074421
157356,378872,EA,Electronic Arts Breaks Down a Record Quarter,news,"Investors were pleased with the recent earnings report from Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   The fiscal third quarter  which includes the all important holiday shopping season  showed robust demand across new and established video game franchises  with the pivot toward digital delivery continuing to lift profitability 
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts  EA executives broke down the record quarter and explained why they re projecting faster growth for the rest of fiscal 2020  and moderating gains in 2021  Let s look at some highlights from that presentation 

Portfolio wins
 Our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry     CEO Andrew Wilson
EA had several standout performers across its deep portfolio of gaming content  with eight major titles released during calendar 2019  While management said that release pace was a testament to their unique development infrastructure  they were just as pleased with the company s success capitalizing on subscription based services and live events 
The third season of Apex Legends  competition attracted higher engagement than the second  for example  and FIFA  Madden NFL  and The Sims 4 each contributed to push digital spending up 15  to reach 77  of the broader business   With the strength of our  intellectual property  and live services   CEO Andrew Wilson said   we re well positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content  
Mobile updates
 With many promising titles in incubation at EA  we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us in the mobile market      CFO Blake Jorgensen
EA s releases on game consoles and PCs outperformed as a group  but its mobile division continued to struggle with declining results  Sales fell 6  in that channel  which focuses on casual games for smartphones and tablet devices 
Management noted that this drop was an improvement over the prior quarter  though  and included some licensing wins such as a new deal that s bringing Command and Conquer  Red Alert to the Chinese market 
Executives said they ve got some other promising mobile titles in the works that may help it finally break into the top grossing sales charts  Yet investors will have to wait and see whether the new game releases return that segment to growth in fiscal 2021 
Looking past a transition year

 Looking forward to fiscal 2021  our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability  even as we invest in the new platforms  We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver  followed by the launch of new content across a broad range of genres     Jorgensen

The next fiscal year starts in just a few months  and investors should brace for volatility as gamers delay spending in anticipation of next generation console releases 
Without issuing specifics  executives said they re expecting to continue growing sales and operating margins before gains accelerate in fiscal 2022  thanks to an established base of console gamers and a packed pipeline of releases that take advantage of the new hardware 
Shareholders should get more specifics on that 2021 and 2022 outlook during EA s earnings release in early May  which will also include updates to the tech stock s capital return plans  now that it has completed its two year   2 4 billion stock buyback program ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/przld,2077919
157357,378873,EA,Take Two drops nearly 10  on quarterly adjusted revenue miss,news," Reuters    Take Two  NASDAQ TTWO  Interactive Software Inc fell nearly 10  after the bell on Thursday  as the videogame publisher missed estimates for quarterly adjusted revenue amid competition from big budget titles from rivals Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  and Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA

157358,378874,EA,Electronic Arts Management Is  Excited  About Its Worst Performing Segment,news,"While Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  is seeing strong growth in its live services business  which includes in game spending and subscriptions  the video game company s mobile revenue continues to tumble  In its fiscal third quarter  revenue from mobile titles fell 6  year over year and 17  on a trailing 12 month basis  
Excluding foreign currency changes  mobile revenue was up for the quarter  which ended Dec  31  Still  it s apparent that EA s mobile gaming segment is underperforming the industry  Overall  mobile game sales increased 10  last year  according to market research firm Newzoo  
Despite that  CEO Andrew Wilson sounded upbeat on the recent earnings call   I m more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years   he said  That optimism might have raised a few eyebrows  but during the call  Wilson also outlined three tactics and strategies the company is focusing on that could help it turn the mobile business around 

1  Improve content monetization
Making money from mobile games can be tricky  The basic strategy in the industry is to release titles for free in the hope that a small percentage of users will want to upgrade how they play and spend money on in app purchases  Some games may have short windows of popularity  but there are plenty that have staying power and become consistent cash cows for their developers 
Activision Blizzard s  NASDAQ ATVI  King subsidiary  the maker of Candy Crush  exemplifies how lucrative this model can be  In the third quarter  King s mobile titles generated most of Activision Blizzard s operating income  
While EA doesn t have a mega hit like Candy Crush  management believes they can do a much better job of monetizing their catalog of mobile games  Wilson pointed out that EA s studio leadership team is working with  leaders from the broader industry  who are  changing a philosophy around  how EA creates and monetizes content  
 And you should expect that we ll continue to focus in that area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven t been as focused on   Wilson said  
2  Make better games
The other key to generating more revenue from mobile is simply to produce better games  While Wilson believes the company already has some titles that can perform better  he said   We have a number of mobile titles in development that I m actually very excited about   
Two of those titles in development will have a soft launch in the next year  although they haven t been officially announced yet  
One upcoming release that has been confirmed is Apex Legends  a battle royale shooter that has become quite popular on PC and console platforms  The company s plans to release more games in new regions around the world will include a mobile version of Apex for China at some point  
There is high demand for engaging shooters on mobile devices right now  Riding the same trends that lifted rivals  titles such as Fortnite and PUBG to mobile success  Activision released a mobile version of Call of Duty last fall that was downloaded over 100 million times in the first month after its release  
3  Mobile acquisitions are a possibility
Wilson also isn t ruling out possible partnerships and acquisitions to drive growth in its mobile business  EA is flush with cash    it ended the fiscal third quarter with  5 6 billion in the bank  Plus  it generated  1 9 billion in operating cash flow over the last year  
The only problem is that there may not be an opportunity to make a big splash the way Activision Blizzard did in 2016 when it dropped  5 9 billion on King Digital Entertainment  EA could finance a similar transaction if an appropriate target appeared  but as Wilson noted   There s not a lot of those out there as it turns out   
Sales from mobile games totaled  68 billion in 2019  according to Newzoo  making that the largest category of revenue in the video game industry  This is a market that game companies will want to focus on for growth  especially with new technologies like augmented reality  AR  emerging  If you can measure a three dimensional object like a box with your phone  surely game studios can think of ways to integrate AR into captivating games 
Mobile revenue makes up less than 10  of EA s business  so the segment s weak performance won t be a deal breaker for investors looking for growth  But as Wilson said   Mobile continues to be a focus for us  and we believe there s a growth opportunity ahead   
This might be an overlooked catalyst that investors want to keep an eye on ",2020-02-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pssi2,2079856
157379,378895,EA,5 Things to Know About Electronic Arts  Fastest Growing Business,news,"Investors are showing Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  some love again heading into 2020  After a sharp fall in 2018  the stock has rebounded 23  over the past year  
The difference between 2018 and 2019 is the momentum in live services  which includes revenue that the company generates from extra content sold to players in a game  Live services revenue increased 50  year over year in the fiscal second quarter  which ended in September  and is up 17  in the trailing 12 month period  making it EA s fastest growing sales category  
Here are five things investors need to know about this increasingly important segment of EA s business 

1  It s the largest source of revenue
While EA still depends on selling new releases to drive a good portion of its top line  revenue from live services made up 52  of the company s total through the fiscal second quarter  That s higher than the 45  that live services totaled in fiscal 2019  
Management has said live services will become increasingly important to its business going forward as players spend time in certain titles for longer stretches  
2  It s more than in game spending
EA s live services business also includes revenue from subscriptions  advertising  esports  and game software that s licensed to third parties that distribute EA s games on digital platforms  Out of those four sources  the two to watch are subscriptions and esports 
The company offers a few subscription services  including EA Access  Origin Access  and Origin Access Premier  These services allow players access to select games from EA s game catalog for a monthly fee  The company believes these services help build deeper connections with players and offer subscribers an economical way to play various titles  
Management is looking to expand the subscriptions business  especially in cloud gaming  The industry is increasingly moving to a subscription model as books  movies  and music have already done  Top tech giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft are investing heavily in this area  too  with Google Stadia and Project xCloud  respectively  
EA doesn t disclose revenue from esports  so it s still a small portion of the business currently  but it s the moonshot opportunity that could emerge as a major market  The company s two popular sports franchises  Madden NFL and FIFA  have been staples in the esports scene  but EA is planning to expand its presence in this space with additional franchises in the coming months  
3  Sports titles are the primary driver of live services growth
The largest source of revenue within live services is the Ultimate Team game mode in Madden NFL and FIFA  With Ultimate Team  players spend money to collect current and former athletes that they can use to compete against other players online  
Revenue from Ultimate Team made up 28  of the top line in fiscal 2019  The year before  Ultimate Team accounted for 21  of total revenue  and in fiscal 2017  that figure was just 16   EA specifies that a substantial portion of Ultimate Team revenue comes from FIFA  
Meanwhile  in the most recent earnings report  the total number of FIFA players increased nearly 15  year over year   
4  It s a recurring revenue source
Management considers the revenue generated from sports titles to be a recurring revenue stream  mainly because EA releases a new version of Madden NFL and FIFA every year  The new versions come with updates to team rosters and other features  These games have a dedicated player base who not only buy the new version but also spend money on Ultimate Team throughout the year 
This is one reason the stock is climbing right now  The more Ultimate Team grows as a percentage of EA s revenue  the less dependent EA becomes on revenue from non sports titles  which is not nearly as consistent and predictable for the company 
5  Live services revenue jumped significantly last quarter
After a temporary slowdown in calendar 2018  growth in live services has exploded over the past three quarters    with 50  year over year growth in the fiscal second quarter  
The company reports fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday  Jan  30  after the market closes  Investors should focus on results from the battle royale shooter Apex Legends and Ultimate Team  as management expects these to be the drivers of live services growth for the quarter  
Looking ahead  EA expects to deliver more growth in fiscal 2021  driven by continued momentum in live services and its subscriptions business ",2020-01-27,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pne1h,2068365

Order  as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA  Madden NFL  Apex Legends  and The Sims 4  we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season  As a result  our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance  growing significantly year over year for the quarter  We re raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year  and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY20 What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business  our focus on quality experiences  and a deep commitment to execution  We re growing our IP portfolio with more great new games  our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry  and we re expanding to more distribution channels so we can connect more players to the games they love  As a result  players are deeply engaged in our top games  sentiment scores are strong  and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business I ll touch on a few highlights here  Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger  Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season  Respawn delivered an expertly crafted  high quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players  made many game of the year lists  and sold beyond our projections for the quarter  In addition to Jedi  Fallen Order  the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well  Two years and dozens of content updates later spanning all three trilogies and more  critics have rereviewed the game to high scores  player sentiment is exceptional  and the celebration Edition helped to drive performance for Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations  Our communities in both Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars  The Old Republic are thriving  as well  The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies  and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilm It s nearly one year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends  and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continue to grow  Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio  Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community  Season Three was bigger than Season Two with higher peaks in daily active users  Within those seasons  in game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience  We re also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch  We have plans to reach more platforms in FY  21  and there s a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends Global Series that is now under way  We re pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming  joining Gillette  Snickers  Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio It s been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world  Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike  Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise  setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter  Our FIFA franchise also grew year over year in Q3  VOLTA Football brought an all new dimensionTo FIFA 20  and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans  with FUT matches up nearly 40  year over year from launch through Q3  FIFA 20 is also the Number 1 most engaged title in our subscription services  We re now getting ready to launch two major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with the prestigious South American club tournaments  CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericana  as well as the eLibertadores  a new expansion to our FIFA 20 Global Series esports competitions  In addition to South America  Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise with FIFA Online up significantly year over year in Q3 In other dimensions of our portfolio  we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life to date  Our eighth expansion pack for the game  Discover University continued to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community as did the surprise addition of The Child from The Mandalorian series on Disney  just before the holidays  Meanwhile  PvZ Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun new experiences to fans around the world Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts  and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams  working together around the world  allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players  From FIFA to Star Wars  Apex to Madden  The Sims to Need for Speed and more  we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play  The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth and we re excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP  with partner and indie content  and some more surprises to come Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business  Our teams are among the best in the industry and is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players  With content updates and in game events in Ultimate Team  creative and original new Seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters  new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice  and more content across our top mobile titles around the world  live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead With the strength of our IP and live services  we re well positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content  We are bringing our games and IP to new regions  including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China  With our subscription services now available on three major platforms and coming to Steam in FY  21  we re expanding our leadership in high valued  low friction subscription model for more players  And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties  we re bringing Apex Legends competitions to the global stage and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year  We re looking forward to finishing this year strong  delivering for players and continuing our growth into FY  21 Now  I ll hand the call over to Blake Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Andrew  EA successfully launched three games last quarter  Need for Speed Heat  Plants Versus Zombies  Battle for Neighborville  and  of course  Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order  That brings the total for calendar 2019 to eight  Launching eight major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking  but that number only tells part of the story  For example  for Battlefield V  we launched a whole new theater of war  with maps  vehicles  weapons and more  driving a major shift in engagement  For Star Wars Battlefront II  we introduced game changing heroes  fan favorite reinforcements  exotic planets  and epic new ways to play across all three cinematic eras  For Apex Legends  we launched three seasons of content  including three new Legends  five in game events  three town takeovers  a whole new map and six new game modes  Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company  and the way in which we unite to achieve our goals  And it works We had another great quarter  with record net bookings in live services as a whole  and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular  Apex Legends is having a fantastic Season  and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order  As a result  we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months  EA s net revenue was  1 593 billion  and operating expenses were  724 million  GAAP operating income was  361 million and resulted in earnings per share of  1 18   0 26 better than our guidance  The year on year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation  which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan  Remember that the true up in Q3 last year was negative  That combined with the positive true up this year creates a  58 million swing year on year  There was also underlying growth in R D as we continue to invest in game development Operating cash flow for the quarter was  1 104 billion  up  150 million from last year  Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a new record  at  1 898 billion  Capital expenditures for the quarter were  28 million  resulting in a free cash flow of  1 076 billion  See our earnings slides for further details on this information During the quarter  we repurchased 3 1 million shares at a cost of  305 million  We ve now returned to shareholders over  2 billion of the  2 4 billion in our two year buyback program that we began in May 2018  We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call  Our cash and short term investments at the end of the quarter were  5 6 billion Total net bookings for the quarter were  1 978 billion  up 23  on the prior year  despite a  39 million FX headwind  Sales of Star Wars  Jedi Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations  We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year  but hit the high end of that in the third quarter and we now anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year  a very strong result for a single player action game  Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden s more than 30 year history  Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio  with discounts smaller and applied later than last year Diving into the digital net bookings  Digital net bookings were  1 444 billion  up 20  on the year ago period  Digital net bookings now represent 77  of our business on a trailing 12 month basis  This compares to 74  in the prior year  Live services net bookings were up 27   to  993 million  Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services  and  993 million is an all time high  Growth was led by Apex Legends  but closely followed by double digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams  Growth in FIFA Online in Asia was also extremely strong Mobile delivered net bookings of  134 million  down 6  year over year  but above our expectations  driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio  particularly in Asia  Including our IP licensing deals  such as the one for Command and Conquer  Red Alert in China  mobile is up year on year at constant currency  With many promising titles in incubation at EA  we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us in the mobile market Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of  317 million  16  higher than last year  Growth was driven by increased game sales plus the ongoing shift to digital  Overall  49  of our units sold through were digital rather than physical  measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months  This compares to 47  a year ago  We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital Turning to guidance  we expect full year GAAP net revenue to be  5 475 billion  and for diluted earnings per share to be  9 90  We expect operating cash flow of about  1 725 billion  We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around  140 million  which would deliver free cash flow of about  1 585 billion   135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year  We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of  5 150 billion  up  25 million over our prior guidance  and up  50 million from where we started the year  For the fourth quarter  we expect net revenue of  1 325 billion  cost of revenue to be  257 million  and operating expenses of  724 million  OpEx is down year on year  reflecting the two new IPs we launched last year  This results in diluted earnings per share of  1 05 for the fourth quarter  using the diluted share count of 293 million  We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be  1 152 billion  This is slightly down year on year  with broad based strength this year offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year Looking forward to fiscal 2021  our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability  even as we invest in the new platforms  We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver  followed by the launch of new content across a broad range of genres  We re launching four sports titles  including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises  four other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP and we ll also publish four titles globally from smaller developers  Finally  we expect two new mobile titles to make it into soft launch We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leverage the growing base of the next generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield  This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22  plus new and ongoing live services and other titles  We create long term value by growing strong live services  launching new content  and expanding our reach  This broad based model reduces our dependence on individual titles  decreases risk  and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high quality entertainment for our players Now I ll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Blake  We re delivering for our players  and our business is growing  Our foundation is great IP that excites and engages hundreds of millions of players  We ve added to the breadth and depth of our portfolio with great games like Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order  and the innovation in FIFA  Madden and our ongoing franchises is helping us reach new fans and grow our total player base  We re looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises  new IP  new partner and indie titles  and some other surprises in FY21 and beyond Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games  and enable strong ongoing growth for our business  We design experiences for longevity  creating communities where our players love to connect  share and compete with friends for months and years to come  Our live services for Apex Legends  EA SPORTS Ultimate Team  The Sims 4  Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement  and we ll bring more great  creative content and in game events to those communities throughout the year ahead  Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas  New consoles are coming  and we ll be ready to lead with some of our top titles Our esports portfolio will expand to four franchises this year  with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors  We re continuing to add to the value of our subscription offerings  reaching more players through more distribution channels  and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can t wait to play  It s an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry  and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world Now Blake and I are here for your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer   Company  Please go ahead Andrew Uerkwitz    Oppenheimer   Co     AnalystThanks gentlemen for taking my question  Looking at the past two Star War games  one was a massive multiplayer  one was obviously a big single player  It seems like sales numbers initially are roughly the same  but one has got live services  one doesn t  How has that shaped the way you think about future game design as we head into the next console with a big focus on live services Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerGreat question  And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow  so do their motivation  As we think about making games  we think about the motivation to what people want to play  inspiration escape model  social connection  creation  self improvement  all these types of things  And as we start to look at the broader player base and we think about each of the cohorts within that  we re looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations and what we ve come to understand  particularly with Star Wars is it s a really  really big fan base and while social interaction  competition and multiplayer is really important for a large portion of that fan base  what we have seen through the last quarter  is it also is that inspiration and escape model that living the Jedi journey  the Jedi story  As we think about this on a go forward basis  you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base Andrew Uerkwitz    Oppenheimer   Co     AnalystAnd if I could just ask one follow up  As we think about live services  but also more distribution channels more    easier hopefully cheaper marketing  Should we expect EA to launch more than eight games when we look out three  four  five years or is kind of like is eight a good number Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerI would start by saying eight is a lot  If you think about the various game launches across the industry  there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution  And so we feel really good about that number  The other thing that s important to understand is this also has a layering effect  So  as we launch games that have live services that last one  two  three  and in some cases  four and five years  the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really  really strong  And so I think eight is probably a pretty good number  Some years there might be a few more of that  some it might be a few less than that  but we feel really good The other thing that we re starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high value low friction business model  we now have a lot of other third parties and Indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content  And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great high quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry  we re also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third party and Indie developers Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And what I would add to Andrew s comment is  remember one of the major strengths of our business is a deep catalog  And a deep catalog is based on not just this year s games or last year s games  but maybe even games from two or three or four years ago  And we sometimes see north of  1 billion in catalog sales in the following year  That s very powerful to us  It s very profitable  And it is critical in continuing to maintain the brands that we have built  And fans will come into games at many different levels either through direct purchase or through subscriptions  And that deep bench is something that creates a lot of value which I m not sure people always think about as we re thinking about the value of the overall business Andrew Uerkwitz    Oppenheimer   Co     AnalystGot it  Thanks gentlemen and congrats on the quarter Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerThanks Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks Chris Evenden    Vice President  Investor RelationsNext question OperatorYour next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Matthew Cost    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi guys  it s Matt on for Brian  Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question  The first one is just on the mobile business  It seems like you made some great progress  obviously  on constant currency growing year on year  Can you talk about sort of what you re seeing in that business and maybe any thoughts you re having on potentially partnering with other mobile app developers and some of your competitors have seen some success recently following the strategy like that particularly in terms of going into markets like Asia  And then if you could just quickly an update on Project Atlas  Thank you Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  obviously  rolling mobile out in China  you need to have a partner  And as we ve said in the prepared remarks today that we re working with a partner there and we re very excited about the opportunity  That partner is also helping us develop a mobile Apex for the globe  And    well  more to come on that in terms of timing  but that s also a big upside for us  We have not built a lot into our forecast for next year on that  because the timing is always uncertain  But we do believe that there s a lot of opportunity there Obviously  we ll also do a PC version of Apex in China through that same partner  But we will selectively use partners where possible  We have some great studios  We think we can continue to build great games  But where possible  where a partner can either increase the time to market  or help us in markets where we don t necessarily have the ability to go to market ourselves  like China  we will use partners  And more to come on Apex and any other titles that might fit in that Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerJust a couple of other thoughts  We ve talked in previous calls about kind of a three pronged strategy around mobile  the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that may be some of the best of breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that  I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really  really high powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company  They are coming in and working with our teams and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content  And we re starting to see that pay out  And you should expect that we ll continue to focus in an area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven t been as focused on The second pillar has been    we are a game development company  We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application  And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I m actually very excited about  Two of which  as we said in the prepared remarks  will go into soft launch in the next year or so and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well  And then third  we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition  There s not a lot of those out there as it turns out  but we re trying to make sure that we re in every conversation  So we do    mobile continues to be a focus for us and we do believe there s a growth opportunity ahead Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerOn Project Atlas  the other part of your question  you ll continue to hear more from us about streaming and other components of Atlas  We re in tight connection and conversations with all of the players that are doing streaming  We re very excited about where it s going and the potential  as well as how we can continue to improve the tools that people use inside of the subscription models that we put in place  So a simple reminder  our goal is to be on every platform and to offer our great products to consumers  wherever they want to play them as long as we can play    provide them at a quality level that we re comfortable with  So you re going to hear and see a lot more in the next coming year Matthew Cost    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question comes from Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research  Your line is open Raymond Stochel    Consumer Edge Research    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much for taking my question  Is there anything that you can discuss as far as VOLTA  Can you give us an update on monetization for VOLTA  And then  any more details on FIFA Ultimate Team being up double digits this call  Is that like for like as far as  Indecipherable  launch  And then  what would be driving that growth  Thanks Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerWe re very happy with VOLTA  VOLTA brought in a whole set of new players and engage them in new and interesting ways  As we ve also talked about a lot in past calls  as we think about building live services  we really think about building engagement first and monetization to follow  As I say  I think that what the team did with VOLTA this year is really  really strong  They ve taken some great learning from feedback they ve received from the community and we ll continue to build on that in the years to come  And while we don t have any announcements yet on monetization  a lot of player feedback is that they would also like to see the opportunity to extend and enhance that VOLTA experience in a way they do with other live services  So we re excited about what that might bring Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerAnd what I would say on Ultimate Team and this is not just FIFA  this is Madden and this is NHL and our other games  The thing you need to remember on Ultimate Team is we continue to refine and improve the weekly or monthly events that we re running on Ultimate Team that bring people into play  People won t play Ultimate Team if they are not having fun  And so the key is how do you build an event that they re going to have fun competing and interacting  It s a social network and it s all about the design of events  And I think the team continues to get better and better every year either refining existing events or adding new events and that s what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports  And it s the thing that people sometimes don t understand when it comes to live services that it s not about the monetization  It s about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy that social connection and that competition with others  And that s what really drives that across all of our live services Chris Evenden    Vice President  Investor RelationsNext question Raymond Stochel    Consumer Edge Research    AnalystGreat  Thanks OperatorYour next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets  Your line is open Gerrick Johnson    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good afternoon  Two questions  First  gross margin  Maybe you could provide us with the puts and takes  the bridge from last year to this year  And then also on the other titles that you did have guidance for  any update to that guidance for those titles  Thank you Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So gross margin is really simple  We sold more Madden  more FIFA and more Star Wars Jedi than we expected  And all three of those are royalty properties  so we had to pay royalty on them  Royalty gets booked in gross margin  That s a good problem to have  I d take that all day long  because obviously it s driving the overall business and the profitability of the business  So nothing more than that  It s pretty straightforward I don t think we have any new news on guidance for anything else  Obviously we ve tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like  As I said in my prepared remarks  we would like to    our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance and we think we ve set up a slate of properties for next year to do that  And we ve also provided people the knowledge that Battlefield s coming the year after that  which should also drive growth the following year  And we see that as a big positive for as we ve said the continued plan to try to have a strong growth  top line bottom line cash flow as we go forward Gerrick Johnson    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies  Your line is open Alexander Giaimo    Jefferies   Company    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking the question  Hoping to dig into Apex aspirations a bit more without getting too bogged down into the F 2020 or F 2021 guide specifically how should investors be thinking broadly about the growth aspirations for that franchise  I think you ve mentioned in the past that you view it as a 10 year franchise and it s obviously early  but should we think about it sort of as a modest straight line grower moving forward or is it a bit more lumpy  And then just given the free to play nature of that game hoping you can just update us on how the profitability of Apex compares to the broader profitability of EA as a whole  Thanks Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYes  it s good questions  I mean as I think Andrew said we re just getting into our one year anniversary in the game which is fantastic  We ve been very pleased with where the game is  The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise  We will continue that journey no different than we ve done with live services  People sometimes forget Ultimate Team was like an  8 million business 12 years ago  And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business and that s how we re thinking about Apex  And we ve continued to bolster the team with new talent  new live service talent  but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they re building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there  I mean it s just an incredible job they ve done It s hard for us to predict  If you would have asked us a month ago  six months ago  we probably wouldn t have known and we still don t know  but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain  But when we come to our May guidance  we ll try to give some people some sense of it  We re going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I m not sure what anyone can do with that information  And if anyone questions that I they go back 7 5 years ago to my very first quarter at the company where I said  we will take away metrics that don t make sense for investors  And we re not necessarily trying to hold back any information  we re not signaling anything  We just realized that we want to make sure you re not doing something with numbers that don t make sense  We ll try to give you as best guidance as we can  We want to grow the business  We think it s got a long history to it  but more to come and we re very excited and very optimistic about where the opportunities can go with Apex Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerJust a small add  At a game level  as we look at the industry and the games that have actually lasted a decade or more  things like League of Legends  things like CS  Go  things like DOTA 2 that continue to engage huge populations of players around the world  There s really kind of three core pillars of those games  really compelling and identifiable characters  a truly compelling world  and competitive skill based highly social game play that continues to evolve and emerge over time as players continue to get better in the game  They are the three core tent poles of Apex Legends as again and as we think about the next year and the year after and we add new geographies and we had new platforms  again  as what Blake said  it s hard to predict exactly how that will grow  but our belief is that we have growth ahead and we re very  very encouraged and excited by the fact that the team gets better and better at answering needs of the players  Season 3 was bigger than Season 2  We expect Season 4 will grow again and we re excited about what will come Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And you mentioned our comments in the past around  we re trying to build a long term franchise  At the end of the day  we would much rather have something that lasts for many  many years    doesn t    is not a boom and bust  And that s how we re trying to design the business  The team is very aligned with that  And if it can turn into essentially an annual shooter for us as part of our franchises  We think that s huge value to the overall company  So that s how we re looking at it and how we re approaching it  And we think everyone s aligned around that and more to come Alexander Giaimo    Jefferies   Company    AnalystThanks guys Chris Evenden    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Next question OperatorYour next question comes from Jeff Cohen with Stephens  Your line is open Jeff Cohen    Stephens Inc     AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking the question  Could you talk about how big of a driver Jedi  Fallen Order was for new subscribers to origin access  And then  broadly  just  can you talk about how churn has trended within your subscription products Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So remember that it s the premier subscription that gets frontline titles  which is only part of the overall origin access model and not in the Sony or Microsoft program  Obviously  it added to it  but its early days  So it s hard to understand if people came in and then went out  because they re still playing the game  We have not seen big changes in churn  It s been a big question for us  because we don t have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio  So you re always going to wonder about churn  But we re continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners And we think any time we ve added new content  that drives people in  Even we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription  which will be still months from now  we re sure that that will also bring people in  And the most important part is    what we found out is  people actually come in for certain titles  We know this because we watch the data before they joined the subscription and after  And we find out they play titles that they ve never played before and then start playing them a lot  So we ve reduced the barrier of trial  They don t have to go and buy the game  they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription  And that s a huge win  as we start to build people into new  either games or genres or sports that they ve never played before  because it only increases the growth of their interest in playing great games Jeff Cohen    Stephens Inc     AnalystThanks  Blake  Congrats on the quarter Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorYour next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust  Your line is open Matthew Thornton    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking the question  Without getting into maybe any specific dates or even titles specifically  maybe to give us a little more update just on kind of how you re feeling about the pipeline  maybe  relative to where we were six  12 months ago that the products that are out there across the various studios  Any color there would be helpful  And then  just coming back to Sims and Apex in particular  Blake  I think  you had talked about those franchises doing  call it   300 million to  400 million for the year  Are those still reasonable ending points for those franchises  Thanks  guys Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would say  they re definitely reasonable franchise points for those franchises and both are continuing to do well  The Sims had an expansion pack in the fall that has done extremely well  And it is just an amazing business that continues to grow  as more and more people come in  And then those people go backwards by expansion packs from history as well as by the new expansion packs and it just builds on that social network that we ve effectively created inside The Sims  And we ll see similar behavior with Apex even though it s not expansion packs  more and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they re seeing and build around the social network No more color yet on the forward looking  Obviously  you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year  Obviously next year we re going to    we ve said we d most likely add at least one new sports game  And we have some third party games we will have in for next year and a couple of things that we haven t yet announced  But as we said earlier  we re very focused on growing both top line and bottom line both next year and the following year as well as future years  But I just want to give people a sense that we ve got a fairly extensive set of titles that people should get pretty comfortable on going forward  And  obviously  we re also working on a lot of our famous franchises that will come in the future plus some continued new franchises that we ll continue to add and live services associated with all those Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Just as a kind of an add to that  again we benefit from a large number of very well established studios with great teams with a track history of delivering really high quality content  So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE LA and Respawn  and our EA SPORTS studios  there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more I also talked about a number of mobile titles  a couple of which will come into soft launch next year  But I would tell you I m more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years  And again I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it s very challenging and all companies have discovered that  But I feel better about what I m seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years  And so we feel very good about the long term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And you guys  kind of  imagine and you ve seen this historically in console transitions  As new consoles come out    I don t want to get ahead of our great partners  Microsoft and Sony  but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles  which means a really simple thing  we can do a lot more  And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we re doing with games that will blow people s minds  And that s the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation  not just with us but across the whole industry  And that s why you ve seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last what 20 plus years  And so that s where people sometimes get hung up  They get too focused on the short term and not think about what s transpired historically  And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles  which means we can just do a lot more  And it s going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden  but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power Matthew Thornton    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    AnalystAppreciate the color guys OperatorYour next question comes from Ryan Gee with Bank of America  Your line is open Ryan Gee    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking the questions  A couple on live services  So first very encouraged by the outperformance of Star Wars Jedi from Respawn  So  you guys now have a large player base into which you could generate some additional revenue  So what is the opportunity ahead either for to generate live services revenue from that in fiscal 2022 and or maybe some sort of add on content pack for that game And then as it relates to live services from Ultimate Team  the sequential acceleration to double digits last quarter  are you guys able to see how much of that is a function of just easier year over year comps to the Ultimate Team business versus execution getting players further down the conversion funnel and getting higher spend out of existing payers  Thanks Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Let me hit the Ultimate Team one first and then maybe Andrew can address the Star Wars Jedi  Ultimate Team really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus once again trying to change the ARPU in some fashion  We re very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are  And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage them in better and more events that they re excited in And so as I said earlier  the team has been very good at trying to design new events  add new events  and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event  And I think that s been our biggest single driver plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team  I mean we re    more and more people play Ultimate Team and we think that s very engaging for them  But it s not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport  These are hard core sports fans and this is what they want to do and that s why they engage in Ultimate Team Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerOn Star Wars  no announcements of anything at this point  but what I would say is you re right we have a very  very strong player base  a very engaged player base who feel like what they ve just had the ability to experience as one of the most compelling Star Wars experiences of their life of any formal media  I would also highlight it is a single play game  So any kind of live service or additional content would be different than what we would see in an Ultimate Team or an Apex Legends  But this team who is working on this is one of the most creative teams in our company and certainly in the industry who are thinking about where to take this journey next for players that love this style of play We re excited by what they are going to come up with and in the meantime I also think that this will be one of the strongest catalog sellers for this company over the coming years and will almost certainly help continue to grow our subscription as it moves into our various subscription offers across platforms Chris Evenden    Vice President  Investor RelationsNext question OperatorYour next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays  Your line is open Mario Lu    Barclays PLC    AnalystHey guys  Two questions on my end  One on the Switch and one on Sims  So  Nintendo today announced that the Switch exceeded 52 million units shipped worldwide  which is similar or more than the Xbox One  So therefore  should we expect EA to publish more titles on the Switch going forward  As I understand  currently there s only three EA titles on the platform including Unravel  Fe and the legacy version of FIFA And then secondly on The Sims  the success of Sims 4 is very intriguing to me since the industry is filled with multiplayer experiences  And Facebook recently actually announced that they re coming out with Horizons  a social experience in VR that kind of reminds me of the Sims online  which launched 18 years ago  So  any thoughts on relaunching an online version of the franchise  given its large popularity  Thanks Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerSo let me hit the Switch question and then I ll give Andrew  question on Sims  So we are very pleased with how well Nintendo has done with Switch  I mean  people love the platform  They enjoy it  it s great  And remember there are a lot of people that have both  the Xbox and a Switch or a PlayStation and Switch  because it  in many ways  provides a different experience  particularly a way to access great Nintendo software We are always looking and discussing with Nintendo what else we can put on the platform  And as you can imagine  as the platform grows  our interest in adding content grows for that platform  But we re also conscious of the fact that the top selling titles by a long shot or all Nintendo software  which is fabulous software  but it helps us balance sort of the realities of how big our markets can be there  But trust that we re looking at that  You will hear some more things in the future about what we re putting on the platform  And we re very pleased with how it s grown alongside the growth of both Sony and Microsoft s platforms Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerGreat question on the Sims  A little known fact  I guess  for many  The Sims will be 20 next week  And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally  As we think about The Sims  again  I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier  inspiration  escape  social interaction  creation  self improvement  competition  Typically what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration  escape  creation  self improvement  these type and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition  But a few things are in fact true over the years  One is that  The Sims community has continued to grow  And with the broader social platforms continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play  And we ve seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay  which was a more social experience for us And we re also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up  And we re seeing people compare and contrast  not competition in the traditional sports sense  but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they re able to build inside of their Sims universes  And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud enabled world  you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration  escape  creation  self improvement  motivations  that this notion of social interaction and competition  like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay    sorry  in The Sims Online many  many years ago  that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come  We re very excited  This is a game that  it really doesn t have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players and we think it s a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many  many years to come Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerAnd the one thing that we have with The Sims  that we have with all of our games  but probably the most with the Sims is  its incredibly engaged community  And The Sims team has done an amazing job interacting with the community and trying to understand what they want  And so  it allows us to develop expansion packs  additions  whatever it is or game approaches  that is really coming from the community and we will continue to encourage that  So as we see interest or demand that allows us to go chase that as we develop the product  And I think that s an amazing thing that you don t necessarily have in all games and The Sims is a leader there for us and it makes it such a fabulous opportunity to continue to feed what the community wants Mario Lu    Barclays PLC    AnalystVery helpful  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Michael Ng    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystHi  Thank you very much for the question  I just had one on unit sales  If you look at full game downloads plus packaged goods  it looked like that was up  168 million year on year  And it seems like the key moving parts for Star Wars  Need for Speed more than offsetting Battlefield V  I was just wondering if there are any other factors to consider whether those were catalog sales being better or worse or pricing or the digital shift impacting unit sales that could help us think about things that may have impacted units for the quarter  Thank you Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Well  clearly digital sales continues to grow  I d say remember Star Wars tends to skew a little lower digitally than our average titles just because a lot of the gifting that goes on at holidays  And live services  obviously  was a big driver  But if you think about our expectations as we mentioned we over delivered on Star Wars  we probably under delivered slightly on Plants vs  Zombies but that s one that will sell well over a long period of time in a relatively small title  so that wasn t a big driver  And then Need for Speed is kind of  as we expected  We did as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that this year we had stronger pricing than we had in the past and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past  And that was part of our strategy  but it also helped across the board as you look at overall revenue Michael Ng    Goldman Sachs   Co     AnalystGreat  Thank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel  Your line is open Drew Crum    Stifel Nicolaus   Company  Inc     AnalystOkay  Thanks guys  Can you update us on the progress you ve made with FIFA Online 4 in China during the current fiscal year and how big of a role that plays on growth for fiscal 2021 when you get back to the  200 million annual run rate And then separately with some of the management changes you ve made at DICE and I guess specifically Vince becoming the Director of the LA office  how involved will he in Respawn be with the development of the next Battlefield game  Thanks Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So quickly on the on FIFA Online  we re still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China  That has not impacted the business that much  In fact we re pretty close to getting back to our historical level  We ve shut off FIFA Online in Korea  And FIFA Online 4 there has responded very well  We had strong growth year over year in the quarter for that and it was mainly driven by Korea We will play it over the next few quarters as to when and how we re going to shut it down in China  But we re conscious that we don t want to disrupt the consumer there  And right now both Online 4 and Online 3 are doing well in that marketplace  So more to come on that  But we re pretty close to back to where we were and we re really excited about the growth that s coming off of FIFA Online 4 both in Southeast Asia and in Korea that we re seeing and even in China  So  more to come there  but that s kind of the quick answer Andrew Wilson    Chief Executive OfficerGood question on Vince and Battlefield V  You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization  What this creative council does it kind of operates like a brain trust like was happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment  be constructive  and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on  And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that and that s having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this kind of aligned focused push against both quality and execution With him taking on DICE LA  traditionally DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm  but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things and we re very excited about those things and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that  And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm  we ve got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game  I talked about this last call  I m really excited about what that team is doing  And David Rota who is leading the studios in Europe now is also having a really strong impact and the team is going to do some pretty amazing things OperatorYour next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company  Your line is open Mike Hickey    The Benchmark Company LLC    AnalystHey Andrew  Blake  Chris congrats on the quarter  Thanks for taking my questions  I had one on Vince that  you kind of answered it  but maybe you can go a layer deeper  Obviously  he s a super talented guy  I mean his success in the shooters is truly remarkable with Medal of Honor  Call of Duty  Titanfall  Apex Legends  obviously founded Respawn  I guess just your thoughts on Respawn ex Vince how that studio continues to behave and the leadership there And then at the new DICE studio  it sounds like they re going to rebrand that or rename it  You mentioned that perhaps he s inheriting some games in development  therapy development pre production  but I m curious if we can look forward to sort of AAA game from Vince in the shooter genre emerging in two to three years And then I guess broadly speaking new consoles  Blake  great to hear your excitement on new consoles coming to the market and what that means  I share that  It s also seemingly a good time to come out with new IP  So thoughts  I guess  broadly on how you think about new IP on the front end to console cycle  Thank you Blake Jorgensen    Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Just to be clear Vince hasn t stopped working at Respawn  He s still running Respawn  We re asking him to do more and part of what Laura Miele has been doing is trying to make sure Vince has all the resources that he needs  And so giving him the chance to oversee DICE LA also gives them the opportunity to pull resources into the Respawn team if he needs to So there are probably  I don t know  how many new IP ideas we re incubating  So more to come on all of that  Everyone s pretty excited  But I don t want anyone to be mistaken that expanding Vince s remit means in any way that he s not overseeing Respawn  He has got a great team there  He s got a great management team there  We ve continued to bolster that team  But he is still very helpful every day at Respawn as well as helpful across our entire portfolio  So we re very excited about he and the whole team as to how they ve integrated into the company  It s never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company  And I think what the Respawn team hopefully has found out is that  we re actually not bad guys and we re pretty fun to work with  Bad people  sorry  didn t mean to say bad guys  because Laura s a really good lady But I just want people to know  I mean  we try to leverage    and it s not just Vince  its people across our entire portfolio  We try to leverage our best sports experts  our best managers wherever they are  And that we ve got a collection of quite a few of those people and that s what we can continue to produce the games that we produce every year  You don t put out the best of biggest sports games in the world year after year on time and on budget if you don t have amazing people doing that  And Chris is telling me I got it shut it off  because we re out of time  But there was one last    one was one part of your question Mike that we didn t get to  We lost you  All right  All right  everyone  Thank you Andrew Wilson

 Reuters     Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA  launched  Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order  on Friday  garnering strong reviews for its flagship action adventure series that is crucial to its holiday sales  after the videogame publisher shelved  NBA Live  game 
The latest title  which scored 83  on Metacritic earlier in the day  follows the story of one of the last surviving Jedi as he attempts to rebuild the order 
In fiscal 2020  EA expects to sell 6 million to 8 million units of the latest title 
Fextralife  a Twitch streamer with channels views of over 400 million  said the title is a step in the right direction 
 There is a bit too much Uncharted in the game  and I was hoping for more of an action ARPG  akin to Dark Souls    the gaming group said 
The game s official gameplay trailer garnered over 4 million views on YouTube 
The previous titles    Star Wars  Battlefront I  launched in 2015 and  Star Wars  Battlefront II  in 2017   have sold over 33 million copies combined  EA had said in October

157411,378927,EA,With New Video Gaming Consoles and Streaming On the Way  Electronic Arts Stock Is a Value,news,"The last few years haven t been kind to Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  stock  as it has transitioned from a period of high growth to one of more modest expansion 
Along the way  the company has been hit with complaints regarding its in game money making techniques  competition from new free to play rival game makers  and a general industry transition to cloud based gaming  Since peaking in mid 2018  shares are still down some 25   
Things are beginning to look a bit rosier for EA  though  and a relatively inexpensive share price doesn t hurt the investment thesis  Then there s also the looming release of new gaming consoles and new technology to support game streaming  All of that bodes well for the game maker  and the stock looks like a solid bet as 2020 gets underway 

A solid base for 2020
When we last caught up with Electronic Arts  revenue and earnings were back in growth mode on strength from its sports games like Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20  as well as continued growth from the ever popular Sims 4 life simulator 
Since then  there have been a few developments  EA s subscription video game service EA Access    already available on Microsoft s  NASDAQ MSFT  Xbox One and Sony s  NYSE SNE  Playstation 4 consoles    came to the PC via Origin Access  That s a key milestone as the race to video game streaming heats up 
Alphabet s Google entered the fray in November 2019 with the release of its Stadia game streaming platform shortly before that  to mixed reviews  EA s Project Atlas  its own proper game streaming service  has been testing with select players on PC  though a wide release date has yet to emerge  
Also of importance was that EA said its new release Star Wars Jedi  Fallen Order quickly became its best selling digital release of a Star Wars title in the first two weeks of sales and that it became its best selling title for PC in that span as well  Receiving warm reviews from game critics and gamers alike  that bodes well for the sci fi adventure at least reaching management s guidance for six to eight million copies sold  
In the year ahead  the free to play Fortnite competitor Apex Legends is still a focus and is expected to bring in  300 million to  400 million in bookings  as is the Sims 4 
There are upcoming strategy titles  like a remastered version of the original Command   Conquer series and Star Wars  Rise to Power for mobile  New consoles from Microsoft and Sony  the Xbox Series X  and Playstation 5 are also slated for release during the 2020 holiday season 
Almost three years after launch  Nintendo s Switch console has done wonders for the stock  EA doesn t get anything from the launch of the new Xbox and Playstation directly  but new hardware packed with new tech for high end graphics typically spurs on upgrades from players and the subsequent purchase of new games to go with it  
A value on a slower EA
All told  management has called for 9  revenue growth and 15  earnings growth  when backing out one time foreign tax benefits  for its 2020 fiscal year 
That means Electronic Arts is trading for 28 7 times earnings based on those tax adjusted expectations  or just 11 5 times earnings when including the one time tax benefits  As a massive gaming company  EA s sales growth likely won t be able to sustain a double digit rate anymore like in times past  However  shares are flirting with value stock territory   
With an eventful 2020 for the video game world now upon us  and EA preparing to report Q3 fiscal 2020 results  this gaming stock is certainly worth keeping an eye on ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pisaf,2060885

157506,379022,EA,Washington sports investor Leonsis eyes esports as distribution opportunity,news,"By Hilary Russ
OXON HILL  Md   Reuters    Ted Leonsis  who owns several Washington  D C  area professional sports teams and co founded the esports company aXiomatic  said on Wednesday that he has invested in esports ventures partly in hopes of using their platforms as global distribution channels for his data and content 
The sports mogul  who is founder and CEO of Monumental Sports   Entertainment which owns Washington s hockey and basketball franchises  said game developers that are creating their own platforms  are going to have their own streaming and    could be partners with us  
 I d like to see us get more active in streaming our data and our content outside of the U S   and that s why I ve been making such big bets in esports   he told reporters during a sports betting conference sponsored by the American Gaming Association 
With the boom in competitive video gaming and tournaments that can fill arenas with young fans  traditional sports and media companies have been trying to figure out how to enter the evolving space 
At the same time  technology and game companies are creating cloud based gaming platforms 
 Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA   maker of games including The Sims  FIFA19 and Apex Legends  said in October that it was working on such a platform   where a game resides on an EA server instead of a gamer s device   called Project Atlas 
The platforms could add another potential player in a widening field of digital  direct to consumer and over the top streaming options for sports and esports content 
Like some other combinations of traditional sports and esports  Leonsis  holdings illustrate how the two realms are merging 
Monumental owns five sports teams  including the Washington Capitals hockey team and the Washington Wizards basketball team  the Capital One Arena  training facilities and a regional sports network that streams live games directly to fans 
Leonsis is also a co chairman and owns a stake in aXiomatic  which has a controlling interest in Team Liquid  a global esports powerhouse with professional teams in 14 games 
Axiomatic invests in Epic Games  creator of the wildly popular game Fortnite  and China s Tencent also holds a stake in Epic 
Esports is especially popular overseas  and that appeal is expected to keep growing in coming years 
 If you re a young person in India or China  you ll probably have more understanding     of one of our e sports players in 20 years than you will our person playing in the arena   Leonsis said ",2019-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/washington-sports-investor-leonsis-eyes-esports-as-distribution-opportunity-1820311,1820311
157507,379023,EA,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Tariffs  Tariffs  Tariffs
As trading ended Monday  all seemed well on the U S  China trade talks  A Chinese delegation was heading to Washington with a 100 or so team members and the Chinese planned to continue the talks with their counterparts from the Trump administration 
Stocks ended well off their lows 
The reason was that investors and traders believed that President Donald Trump s threat to bump up tariffs from 10  to 25  on some  200 billion in Chinese made goods was simply a negotiating tactic 
Maybe it is  but late Monday afternoon in a session with reporters  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the tariffs will be imposed on Friday because China is reneging on earlier commitments 
Futures markets immediately tanked  with Dow futures off 297 points  S P 500 futures down 38 points and Nasdaq 100 futures down 126 points 
Prices for corn  soybeans and wheat  vulnerable to the vagaries of the trade dispute  also moved lower 
What exactly the issue might be isn t clear  Lighthizer wasn t saying  and  in the meantime  the Chinese delegation was still on its way to Washington for talks now set for Thursday and Friday  A mystery is if Liu He  the Chinese vice premier overseeing economic policy  will attend the talks 
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said while some concerns arose last week when he and Lighthizer were in Beijing for talks  they received some reassurances  Then  over the weekend  the talks went  substantially backward  
2  Beaten Down Lytf Hopes for an Earnings Boost
On the earnings calendar tomorrow  everyone will be looking for the newbie after the bell 
Ride sharing company  Lyft   NASDAQ LYFT  reports postmarket  On average  analysts are looking for a loss of  3 33 per share  according to forecasts compiled by Investing com  Revenue is expected to come in at about  740 million 
This is Lyft s first earnings report since it s debut at the end of March  Since then  it s been hammered by the market  Shares are down more than 22  since the first day of trading 
Also reporting results after the bell is video game company Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  
EA is expected to report a profit of 99 cents per share on revenue of about  1 2 billion  Both would be down from the year ago period But investors will be most interested in any updates on its game pipeline and guidance for the next quarter 
3  Will API Storm up Like EIA 
The American Petroleum Institute s petroleum data  which showed a second straight build last week  will be in spotlight on Tuesday  as U S  output remains at record highs 
Higher U S  crude output and supplies has been outlined as one of the factors that could keep a lid on oil prices ahead of the upcoming summer driving season  which tends to boost demand for crude 
Crude oil inventories for the week ended 26 April  showed total production reached a record of 12 3 million barrels a day  the Energy Information Administration said last week 
As well as China trade trouble  higher U S  inventories  rig counts and production adds to some recent bearishness from crude fundamentals heading into the summer demand season  said Robbie Fraser at Schnider Electric

157545,379061,EA,Electronic Arts  EA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Electronic Arts  EA  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This video game maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 51 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 96 billion  up 22 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Electronic Arts 
For Electronic Arts  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Electronic Arts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Electronic Arts would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 96  delivering a surprise of  12 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Electronic Arts appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/electronic-arts-ea-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200501140,200501140

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Electronic Arts 
For Electronic Arts  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  316 67  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Electronic Arts will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Electronic Arts would post earnings of  0 97 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 41  delivering a surprise of  45 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Electronic Arts doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-electronic-arts-ea-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200443276,200443276

	The Commerce Department decided to delay the action for 90 days  which will help maintain existing networks and handset updates 
	It also helped the market break out of its two day slump with a broad based rally on Tuesday 
	The NASDAQ had been leading the way lower of late  but tech bounced back today  The index advanced 1 08   or about 83 points  to 7785 72

157785,379301,EA,Electronic Arts  EA  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Electronic Arts  EA  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This video game maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  26 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 20 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 287 5  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Electronic Arts 
For Electronic Arts  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  16 29  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Electronic Arts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Electronic Arts would post earnings of  1 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 08  delivering a surprise of  7 77  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Electronic Arts appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/electronic-arts-ea-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200412985,200412985

The Chinese Super League  CSL  said on Monday that it had signed a six year partnership with Beijing based developer Crazy Sports to develop soccer related games based on 16 CSL teams and the league through 2022 
Fans of soccer video games such as Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  Inc s top selling FIFA franchise  have been closely watching the CSL s gaming plans as its deep pocketed teams have recruited global stars such as Carlos Tevez  Oscar and Hulk in recent months 
EA in June poured cold water on rumors that the CSL would feature in  FIFA 18   the latest version of the franchise  citing licensing issues  according to sports website goal com  EA has deals with leagues around the world including the English Premier League and Italian Serie A

Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  soared 6  Tuesday morning  after fresh data confirmed the popularity of newly released video game  Apex Legends

Electronic Arts  EA  Stock Weekly Chart

Yesterday Merrill Lynch and Piper Jaffray upgraded Electronic Arts based on their expectations Apex Legends  However  the stock declined on the day  Yet EA later confirmed that Apex had 25 million downloads and 2 million concurrent players in its first week 
Today the stock is trading higher  Merrill has a  110 price target and Piper has a target of only  99  With the earnings of game makers dwindling  it is unclear whether a single game can drive a sustained earnings recovery 
In analyzing the market cycles for EA  we can see the stock is still in the rising phase of its current cycle  However  it is now in resistance  Further  recent cycles are negatively configured  meaning they ended the cycles lower than where they began  We believe it will fail and test its recent lows around  80 by late April

157909,379425,EA,U S  justices refuse to hear college athlete compensation cases,news,By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up the contentious issue of pay for college athletes  leaving in place a lower court s decision finding that rules by the governing body for collegiate sports limiting compensation violate antitrust law   The justices declined to hear an appeal by the National Collegiate Athletic Association seeking to reverse a decision by the San Francisco based 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  That court ruled in September 2015 that the NCAA s ban on compensating athletes for use of their names and images in TV broadcasts and video games constituted a restraint of trade under federal antitrust law  The high court also declined to hear a parallel appeal filed by a group of former college basketball and football players led by former UCLA basketball star Ed O Bannon  The plaintiffs had objected to a part of the appeals court ruling that threw out an injunction that had allowed athletes to be paid up to  5 000 in deferred compensation per year  to be held in trust until after they leave college  The issue of pay for college athletes has gained momentum as the amount of money for television rights going to the NCAA and sports conferences like the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten has skyrocketed  with athletes frozen out of the riches  For example  the NCAA announced in April an eight year   8 8 billion extension of its TV rights with CBS and Turner for the annual March Madness men s basketball tournament  Athletes receive scholarships to attend universities whose tuition often costs tens of thousands of dollars annually  But the NCAA prohibits pay to athletes even as individual universities often rake in millions of dollars for the lucrative sports of football and basketball   Critics say the NCAA s scholarship policy short changes athletes who risk injury and devote many hours to practice sessions  travel and competition  Most college athletes do not go on to play professionally  The NCAA has said it is defending amateurism in college sports  Since Aug  1  2015  it has allowed schools to fund the full cost of attendance for top college athletes  More than 20 current and former athletes filed an antitrust class action against the NCAA in 2009  O Bannon won a national basketball championship with UCLA in 1995  He testified during the trial phase of the case that he usually spent about 40 to 45 hours per week on basketball   I was an athlete masquerading as a student   O Bannon  who spent two seasons in the National Basketball Association  told the court  O Bannon pursued the lawsuit after seeing himself depicted in a college basketball video game produced by  Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA   which he also sued but is no longer involved in the case  The appeals court said athletes have a right of publicity in video games  but it declined to decide whether they also have such rights in live TV broadcasts or archival footage ,2016-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/u.s.-justices-refuse-to-hear-college-athlete-compensation-cases-429986,429986

157921,379437,EA,Why Electronic Arts  EA  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Electronic Arts  EA   This company  which is in the Zacks Toys   Games   Hobbies industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This video game maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 201 15  
For the most recent quarter  Electronic Arts was expected to post earnings of  0 58 per share  but it reported  0 98 per share instead  representing a surprise of 68 97   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 06 per share  while it actually produced  0 26 per share  a surprise of 333 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Electronic Arts lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Electronic Arts currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 64   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 5  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-electronic-arts-ea-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200374858,200374858
157922,379438,EA,Analysts Estimate Electronic Arts  EA  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Electronic Arts  EA  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This video game maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 93 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 76 billion  down 10 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 92  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Electronic Arts 
For Electronic Arts  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 78  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Electronic Arts will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Electronic Arts would post earnings of  0 58 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 98  delivering a surprise of  68 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Electronic Arts doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-electronic-arts-ea-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200380624,200380624

157993,379509,EA,A Strange Problem To Have,opinion,"We are only 18 trading days into the final quarter of the year  and part of me wants to close out everything  chalk up a profitable year  and be done with it  I honestly don t think I ve had such a powerful run in such a short span of time since  well  a decade ago  Going entirely into cash right now would take risk to zero and allow me to lock in all these fabulous profits 
Just look at how quickly things have become undone  That sliver of time on the right utterly unwound the long slog of gains shown in green  Sell offs are swift and severe  aren t they 

Of course  there are a couple of problems that leap to mind when considering the idea of calling the year  done   First of all   what would I do with myself  I mean  honestly  am I supposed to binge watch stuff on Netflix until 2019  And second  I ve built Slope to be a place for ideas and discussion about the market  I can t fake interest in the market if I m out of it  So I m kind of forced to stay engaged  Someone else will have to spend their time binge watching 
I was chiding folks here on Slope for  bottom calling   but listen  I m scared to pieces about some big stick save from our friends in the government  What if Powell buckled to all the harassment he s getting from genius boy and announced that interest rates would stay where they are for the foreseeable future  What if China and the U S  announced some kind of big trade breakthrough  I feel like  more than ever  I m looking over my shoulder for something to come along and wreck all this fun  This is just going far  far too well to sustain itself 
The thing is  the vast majority of so called traders out there have never even SEEN a bear market before  They consider it their God given right to have stocks rise endlessly  I look at  WSB every day to watch the clueless millennials chatter about their losses  and the rationale     if you want to call it that     for making decisions is simply laughable  For instance 

Umm  Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   The maker of video game software  A  safe stock   Sort of like a utility company or a Treasury bond  right  Hey  but at least this young man has done his due diligence with respect to fundamentals  right  They make  plenty of profit  and their financials are  great   Oh  and Battlefield V comes out next month 
What a dolt 
Anyway  I ve got 80 shorts  every single one of them profitable  and I am mildly scared to pieces  The last ten years have banged into people s heads that the government is on the side of the Bulls  never the Bears  Thus  I m torn between absolutely zeroing out my portfolio and not having to worry or     far worse     watching the market go completely to hell without me in it ",2018-10-25,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-strange-problem-to-have-200350537,200350537

 EA delivered first quarter revenue  margins and EPS above guidance through strength in catalog sales and outperformance in digital live services offerings   said Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen   We are raising our full year guidance today to reflect the momentum across our portfolio

The company did not make changes to its previous forecast of non GAAP revenue of  4 1 billion and earnings per share of  1 85 in the fiscal year ending March 2015 
 It s appropriately conservative     They are obviously trying to be cautious given the changing release schedule   R W  Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said  Video game industry software sales  which lagged in April and June  are seeing a boost as games for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 devices  which were launched last holiday  gain steam  But sales of titles for older consoles  which have a larger install base  continue to slip

Thursday after a weak labor market report  but losses were
capped as a steep drop in oil prices was seen helping
consumers 
 Fueling fears about the strength of the economic recovery 
data showed U S  initial jobless claims rose to an eight month
high last week 
 The S P was on its way to a fourth day of losses  adding to
worries about the sustainability of an eight month rally 
 While a big declines in crude oil and other commodities
pushed down related shares  it eased worries about the impact
of energy prices on consumers 
  It looks like it s an unwinding of the risk trade   said
Fred Dickson  chief market strategist at D A  Davidson   Co in
Lake Oswego  Oregon 
 Lower oil   means the tax on consumers should come down a
bit   he said 
 The S P energy index was down 1 1 percent  leading losses
for a fourth day on the S P  Brent crude and U S  crude futures
both slid more than 6 percent 
 The economic news added to investor caution ahead of
Friday s key report on jobs  with unemployment still a big weak
spot for the U S  economy 
  We continue to see a fair amount of weakness in
financials  and that is in part related to the unemployment  
said Thomas Villalta  portfolio manager for Jones Villalta
Asset Management in Austin  Texas   Financials benefit from a
stronger consumer  
 The S P financial sector was down 0 5 percent 
 Still  Villalta said  the market s losses this week could
be an indication that a disappointing payrolls number is
already priced in  and Friday could bring a bounce in stocks

 NEW YORK  May 5  Reuters    The Dow and S P 500 fell on
Thursday after a weak labor market report fueled new fears
about the strength of the economic recovery and as energy
shares tumbled with the price of oil 
 The energy sector of the S P was the worst performer 
falling 3 percent as U S  crude sank 9 percent to below  100 a
barrel  Occidental Petroleum Corp fell 3 4 percent to  105 16 
 But an index of air carriers  a sector sensitive to
fluctuations in energy costs  advanced 3 5 percent  its largest
daily gain in almost two months 
 In the latest report to stir up worries about the strength
of the recovery  data showed weekly jobless claims rose to an
eight month high 
  The market had been pretty good at shrugging off the bad
news   said Kate Schapiro  portfolio manager at Sentinel Asset
Management in San Francisco   The reality is we re still in a
difficult environment  
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 105 31 points  or
0 83 percent  to 12 618 27  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
lost 8 51 points  or 0 63 percent  to 1 338 81  The Nasdaq
Composite Index dipped 2 74 points  or 0 10 percent  to
2 825 49 
 Consumer related shares were buoyed as the drop in crude
was seen lessening the burden of high gasoline prices 
  It seems to me if people feel relatively secure in their
jobs and they have a little money  they are spending it  
Schapiro said   The problem is the very low end of the economy 
where people are getting really squeezed  
 The S P was on its way to a fourth day of losses and
pierced through its 14 day average  The index bounced off an
area that provided strong resistance on the way up and could
become a support level 
 The weak labor data added to investor caution ahead of
Friday s key report on jobs  with unemployment still a weak
spot for the U S  economy 
 Silver touched a five week low and was set for its deepest
weekly decline in nearly 30 years  The iShares Silver Trust
exchange traded fund tumbled 11 percent

highest level since August 2009 before easing to  21 46  up 7 7

rattling the equities market before Friday s payrolls data 
 Oil suffered the biggest one day price drop ever for the
Brent futures contract  which settled down 8 6 percent at
 110 80 per barrel  That drove oil shares lower  making the
energy sector  the worst performer on the S P as it fell
2 3 percent 
 The CBOE volatility index  jumped above its 50 day
average before closing up 6 6 percent at 18 20  its highest
closing level since March 28  The move signals investors are
willing to pay more for protection for their equities

or 0 48 percent  to 2 814 72 
 The S P 500 fell through its 14 day average but closed
above 1 333  a level that could become an important market
support  limiting future losses 
 About 9 2 billion shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  in a third consecutive trading
volume above the year s average 
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of
about 8 to 5 on both the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges 
 Consumer related shares also fell but were the best
performers as the drop in crude was seen lessening the
financial burden on individuals of high gasoline prices

158128,379644,EA,Why Nintendo  NTDOY  Is A Strong Buy ,opinion,"The global video game market is bigger than ever  as esports take off and mobile gaming continues to grow  Yet  even as Activision Blizzard s   NASDAQ ATVI   new  Overwatch  league launches on Wednesday  historic gaming giant Nintendo   OTC NTDOY   looks poised to thrive in the new age of video games 
Near the end of November  market research firm  its initial global video game revenue projections to  116 billion  which marked a  7 1 billion jump and a 10 7  year over year increase  And in just the last 10 months alone  Nintendo has grabbed a decent chunk of that video gaming pie The Japanese gaming power  that as of December 10  worldwide sales of its Switch console surpassed 10 million units  Nintendo s newest gaming console  which launched in March and retails for  299 99  recently became the  console ever in the U S 
Looking forward  Nintendo reportedly expects to sell 20 million Switch devices in its next fiscal year  On top of the Super Mario maker s widely popular new console  the company is also cashing in with a range of classic titles  including a new Pok mon game scheduled for 2018 
The Fundamentals 
Shares of Nintendo climbed nearly 3  on Wednesday as part of what has been a strong run for the company over the last year  Before Wednesday s gains  the legendary Japanese video game maker had seen its stock price skyrocket 77 74  over the last 52 weeks 
Yet  investors will likely be happy to note that Nintendo s stock price sits 8 5  below its 52 week high water mark  This should give the stock room to grow without the added burden of having to break through a new threshold 
However  looking ahead  Nintendo s stock could theoretically soar past its current year long high if it closes in on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  The company is projected to see its current quarter sales soar 138  to reach  3 81 billion 
Looking further down the road to Nintendo s current full fiscal year which ends in March the company s earnings are projected to reach  1 23 per share  This would mark a 232 43  year over year jump  What s more  Nintendo s full year revenues are projected to surge 112  to hit  9 51 billion  based on Zacks Consensus Estimates 
Nintendo s current cash flow growth rate of 92 06  also blows away the  Toys   Games   Hobbies  industry s 10  average  and crushes competitors such as Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA    This should help the company invest in the future 
What s more  the company has received one positive earnings estimate revision for its current fiscal year within the last 60 days  In that same time frame  Nintendo also received one positive revision for the following year  Nintendo is also currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

158145,379661,EA,EA Stocks Plunge After Battlefront II Disaster,opinion,"Financial markets are giving Electronic Arts Inc  NASDAQ EA  stocks the cold shoulder after a marketing fiasco revolving around Battlefront II  a videogame developed by the company  resulted in massively diminished sales figures  Battlefront II  a  Star Wars  game with a large audience that was expected to be one of the year s most successful games  flopped after customers revolted over the company s development practices 
After some  3 billion in company stock was  in less than a month  EA figured it had best learn a lesson from its customers lest it continue to suffer the consequences  The company has since made changes to the game  trying to placate player demands that in game microtransactions be curbed if not outright removed  but the move may be too late to salvage EA s stock 
The gaming industry can be a fickle place  consumers are incredibly tech savvy  and very vocal about their opinions  meaning digital marketing campaigns that swamp consumers during the holiday season can quickly turn into PR nightmares when they re hijacked to highlight product deficiencies  EA s Battlefront II failure will haunt the company for some time  as players on popular sites turned to boycotting the company over its practices and likely won t forget its behavior anytime soon  Some consumers went so far to  to the developers  signaling how quickly things have gotten out of hand 
As EA s competitors continue to climb in the market amidst the company s marketing woes  it will have to struggle to catch up  After social media websites and the popular internet message board Reddit were flooded with complaints  customers abandoned the company in droves  something that only the long winded process of developing a more successful game can reverse 
Physical sales of the game plunged  and the results of holiday shopping from Black Friday and other popular deal days have been less than satisfactory to appease investors  As criticisms grow about the monetization of the gaming industry  which includes  such as gambling aimed at children  EA will face more headwinds on its route to market success  
Winning back old customers
EA has a long  uphill battle to fight if it intends to get its stocks back into healthy territory  The gaming industry that it relies on is extraordinarily hostile to developers at times  and boycotts and threats to developers themselves aren t entirely uncommon occurrences  EA s current market dilemma won t be solved in a boardroom with company executives  to resolve the media storm engulfing it  EA needs to get back to the drawing board  and produce new and better games to win back over an audience that s fed up with its practices 
Such things are often easier said than done  however  Videogames centered on microtransactions earned EA over one and a half billion dollars in FY2017 alone  a figure so daunting as to almost alleviate investor concerns entirely  The company will only be seriously compelled to change its business operations if the lack of physical sales of its games continues for some time  and players refuse to give up their boycott as Christmas and more holiday shopping approaches 
While some investors may wish to see the company continue its microtransaction centered strategy that s brought in such high revenue figures in the past  savvy investors should understand that a culture change is long overdue at EA if it s to succeed well into the future  Customers in its industry no longer trust it  and  worse  are entirely fed up with its marketing antics  brutalizing the company in online reviews  Investors should avoid the stock as if its poison until such a time as the company s leadership turns things around and fosters better practices that win back the community s support and praise 
If EA wants to avoid a continued clobbering in the digital press that caters to its core audience  it needs to bring about these changes immediately  Done right  a company like EA can churn out multiple big hits in a year  and every day their response is delayed is another missed opportunity for the company  EA doesn t have to enter a death spiral  by embracing real  honest reform and learning to put its customers  demands first  the company can avoid future PR disasters that like currently wreaking havoc on its stock  and climb its way back to the top of the market ",2017-11-30,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ea-stocks-plunge-after-battlefront-ii-disaster-200269599,200269599

158166,379682,EA,Zynga  ZNGA  To Report Q3 Earnings  Is A Beat In Store ,opinion,"Zynga Inc    NASDAQ ZNGA   is set to report third quarter 2017 results on Nov 7 
In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In the trailing four quarters  the company missed estimates thrice  resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 200  
Revenues in the second quarter increased 15  year over year to  209 2 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  207 million 
For third quarter 2017  the company expects revenues to be approximately  210 million 
Notably  shares of Zynga have gained 51  year to date  substantially outperforming the 23 8  rally 

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Zynga is one of the leading game developers and has been seeing strength in the mobile game market  The surge in mobile audience is a key growth driver for the company 
We expect Zynga s increasing payer conversion rate driven by games like CSR2 and Zynga Poker to drive its top line  Moreover  the company s acquisition of Solitaire games in the first quarter is anticipated to boost results in the soon to be reported quarter 
Zynga s focus to improve live services is also anticipated to drive growth  Moreover  the company s cost cutting initiatives are helping it to improve operational efficiency 
However  management  on the last conference call  going by historical data  noted that player activity and advertising may decline in the third quarter 
Also  a sluggish web business  along with intensifying competition from the likes of Glu Mobile   NASDAQ GLUU    Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   and Nintendo   OTC NTDOY    remains a concern Zynga Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Zynga is likely to beat estimates due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and  of  33 33   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  You can see 
Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement

158199,379715,EA,Electronic Arts  Participate In The Fast Growing Games Market,opinion,"Summary

Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  is a fast growing video games publisher with strong fundamentals  currently going through a correction due to delays to a new story based Star Wars game 
Given that the global gaming market continues to exhibit strong growth prospects going forward  Electronic Arts is well placed within the industry to benefit from this trend  especially with its promising business model for games 
Electronic Arts is now trading at a reasonable valuation compared to peers  which provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the fast growing global games market 

Quality gaming company going through a correction
Electronic Arts  EA  is the 2nd largest video games publisher  by market capitalization  in the United States  with 56  of revenues coming from outside North America  The company owns several household video game titles such as FIFA  NBA The SIMs and Star Wars and distributes these titles via consoles such as Xbox One   PS4  PCs and even mobile handsets 
In terms of financial health  EA looks to be in very good shape  The company generates a hefty 19 8  return on invested capital as of FY2017  creating value steadily for all capital providers  Balance sheet wise  EA also maintains a very strong cash buffer  accumulating  3 5 billion worth of net cash  that it may choose to employ at any time to create value for shareholders  Being a games publisher with little to no inventory requirement  EA also exhibits very efficient earnings to cash conversion  which shows up in a strong positive free cash flow generation of  1 3 billion as of FY2017 
Recently  EA shares tumbled by almost 3  after it announced a delay for a new story based Star Wars action adventure game  Originally  the company was planning to launch the game between April 2018 through to March 2019  However  due to game design issues  EA decided to overhaul the game  which resulted in the closure of one of its studios  Visceral Games  Though investors took this negatively  punishing its share price  it is still important to note that EA did not cancel the production of the Star Wars game  It was merely a delay  which could result in the development of a better quality game that would generate higher gamer revenues in the future 
Fast growing games market

According to the Newzoo Q2 2017 Global Games Market Report  2 2 billion gamers across the globe are expected to generate  108 9 billion in game revenues in 2017  This represents an increase of 7 8  from the year before  and come 2020  projections show that this figure could increase to  128 5 billion  That s a  6 2  compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  from 2016 to 2020  Electronic Arts  with its household game titles such as FIFA  NBA The SIMs and Star Wars  operate within this fast growing market 
On top of being in an expanding market  EA has also adapted to the increasingly changing gaming landscape by turning to a new business model  Instead of the traditional model of having players make one time purchases  the company now makes mobile free to play games and charges for live services such as competitive tournaments  keeping players coming back for more  This model has worked very well for titles such as FIFA Mobile and Star Wars  Galaxy of Heroes  and would allow EA to gain market share in the future 
Valuations reasonable compared to peers
At current prices  Electronic Arts is trading at a valuation of 36 4x FY2017 P E  Although this might seem expensive at first glance  the company is actually growing at breakneck speeds  with consensus forecasts putting FY2018 EPS at  4 28  representing a projected earnings growth of  35   And the company seems to be on track to achieve this target  given that first quarter EPS beats estimates by 16 1   Q1 EPS at  0 313 versus estimates for  0 270   according to Bloomberg 
On top of fast growth prospects  EA also compares well in terms of relative valuation with its competitors  Fellow game publishers such as Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   Ubisoft  OTC UBSFF  and Nintendo  OTC NTDOY  currently have historical P E multiples of above 40x  Assuming that growth rates are similar across the games publishing industry  Electronic Arts at the current valuation does provide investors with a reasonable price to participate in the fast growing global games industry

158274,379790,EA,Glu Mobile  GLUU  Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Glu Mobile Inc    NASDAQ GLUU   is slated to release second quarter 2017 results on Aug 1 after the closing bell  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 88 89   Moreover  it has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 31 3  in the trailing four quarters 
However  the mobile game maker posted revenue of  56 8 million in the last reported quarter  surpassing the Zacks consensus mark of  53 6 million 
For second quarter 2017  Glu Mobile expects bookings to be in a range of  71  73 million  Adjusted operating expenses are expected in the range of  58 7  59 1 million Glu Mobile Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   We note that the company s shares have gained only 17 5  in the past year  substantially underperforming the 39  rally of the  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 

Factors to Consider
Glu Mobile s roster of games  especially celebrity titles  is one of its biggest positives  Evergreen titles like Cooking Dash  Racing Rivals and Kim Kardashian  Hollywood continues to be a big contributor to revenues  Glu s acquisition of US developer Crowdstar in Nov 2016 has also been a big positive 
In the last reported quarter  the company s significant bookings performance was driven by the remarkable growth of its social interactive interior design game Design Home  a part of the Crowdstar acquisition 
Last month  Glu Mobile signed a multi year licensing agreement with WWE  to develop a mobile game that will be released in 2018  However  analysts observe that app store competition is fierce with three WWE mobile games already live in the market   Warner Bros   WWE Immortals  Scopely s WWE  Champions and Take Two s WWE SuperCard  This impacts Glu s likelihood of generating high level of revenues from the future WWE mobile game 
Moreover  rising competition from established players like Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  remains a concern  Furthermore  we anticipate significant investment in research and development of new game titles to be a potential headwind for the company and put pressure on margins 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Glu Mobile is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Glu Mobile currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 13 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Glu Mobile carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Kemet Corp    NYSE KEM   with an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

The theory states that trends move in repetitive patterns  called waves  The chart above shows a five wave  since 2012  which means Electronic Arts  uptrend is about to continue  Not right away  though  because every impulse is followed by a correction in three waves in the opposite direction  Instead of buying shares in the video gaming giant near all time highs  we should expect a pullback towards the  area of wave 4 near  50 a share  Additionally  the relative strength index shows a strong bearish divergence between waves 3 and 5  emphasizing heavily on the fact that the bulls are exhausted  Electronic Arts is a great company  producing tons of very exciting games  but its stock is too expensive and vulnerable for our taste  If this the correct count  investors should consider it again in a few years  Not now ",2017-02-01,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/electronic-arts-turning-into-an-underperformer-200174364,200174364

Elsewhere look for gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil continues lower  The US Dollar Index also looks to continue lower while US Treasuries continue higher in their consolidation range  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue a slow grind up and Emerging Markets continue to look strong 

Volatility looks to remain low but drifting higher into more normal levels  This could hold back equities in the very short term  The equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   all had their biggest pullbacks of the year  leaving the IWM at the edge of support  the SPY pulling back and the QQQ consolidating  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Buy These 5 Efficient Stocks for Thanksgiving

	A portfolio that comprises companies with favorable efficiency levels is poised to generate alluring returns  Efficiency   a company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs   is a potential indicator of a company s financial health  As the efficiency level of a company has a significant impact on its price performance  investing in companies with an impressive level of efficiency may prove to be a wise decision ahead of Thanksgiving Day 

Ratios to Evaluate Efficiency Levels

	We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive return 

Inventory Turnover

	Inventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory 

Receivables Turnover

	This ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  The receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio may indicate that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio may signal that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy 

Asset Utilization

	This is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater the possibility is that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio may signal that it is failing to use its assets effectively 

Operating Margin

	Another popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses 

	All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have these ratios higher than their respective industry averages 

Screening Parameters

	In addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable 

Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  
	 Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers  

Zacks Rankless than or equal to  2
	 Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through  

	The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 20 

	Here are five stocks from the 20 that made it through the screen 

Electronic Arts Inc   Nasdaq     develops  markets  publishes  and distributes games  content  and services for consoles  personal computers  mobile phones  and tablets worldwide  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 29 9  

Vanda Pharmaceuticals  Inc     Nasdaq     is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of clinical stage product candidates for central nervous system disorders  This Zacks Rank  1 company has an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 56 7

Videogame Stock Roundup  Pokemon Sun and Moon Shatter Records

	Japanese video game giant  Nintendo Co Ltd  OTCMKTS      has had a good year so far  After Pok mon Go s super success  its latest games  Pok mon Sun and Moon have become the  fastest selling games  ever in the Americas  This bodes well especially as we approach the holiday season  Plus  fans across the globe can now enjoy Nintendo games inspired theme areas at four Universal Studios locations  Meanwhile  Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ      chalked out an impressive package for CEO Bobby Kotick  which could reportedly make him one of the  highest paid CEOs  in the U S 

Recap of the Developments

	1  In a press release a couple of days back   said that Pok mon Sun and Pok mon Moon for Nintendo 3DS   already the most pre ordered games ever for the company  have now become the  fastest selling games  in the Americas with over 3 7 million units sold in less than a fortnight 

	The earlier record was held by Pok mon X and Pok mon Y games  which released in 2013  The Pok mon Go craze has definitely given these new 3DS game a little more boost  These games carry a score of 87  on Metacritic  At its last earnings release  for the six months ended Sep 30  2016   management noted that the enthusiasm surrounding Pok mon Go also helped sales of its 3DS console 

	The Pok mon franchise has been a monster hit for Nintendo  Per Nintendo  sales of Pok mon related software topped the 280 million units mark as of May 2016  globally  since it was launched alongside Pok mon Red and Pok mon Blue games in 1996 In fact  Nintendo s Mario and Pok mon are widely recognized as the most successful video game franchises in the world 

	This year has been a pretty good one for the company with shares surging over 75 5  year to date compared with the Zacks Toys Games Hobby Products Industry gain of 9 01   Going ahead  we believe the launch of new games like Super Mario Maker for 3DS and Super Mario Run for iOS should help it continue the momentum  Also  there are a lot of expectations from the recently revamped NES as well as the upcoming launch of the Switch console  At present  Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

	2    NASDAQ      agreement signed way back in May 2015  Per the agreement  Universal Studios and Parks  a unit of Comcast s NBC Universal  will come up with Nintendo games inspired theme areas at four locations including one at Universal Studios in Osaka  Japan  The expansion will bring the much loved characters like Mario and Zelda  along with the action and adventures of Nintendo games to life with a little extra touch of ingenuity  Meanwhile  reportedly  Electronic Arts  NASDAQ       at the Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  2016 Annual Technology Conference  hinted that it will be bringing a big game title for Nintendo s Switch  set to release in Mar 2017 

	3  Activision Blizzard has dished out an impressive  package for its CEO Bobby Kotick  Though it includes a reduction in base pay to  1 8 million from  2 4 million from Jan 2017  his performance related bonus will now be 200  of his base pay if he achieves  certain  targets  As per media reports  the figure will top  56 million  which will catapult Kotick into the league of the highest paid CEOs in the U S  Activision has been doing very good in the past two years under Kotick  He  in fact  has been at the helm for 25 years now  In the past two years  Activision has been taking giant strides  which has well reflected in its share price  Shares of Activision have registered impressive return of 65 7  over the past two years compared with the Zacks Toys Games Hobby Products Industry gain of 49 8  

	Apart from a full fledged video game publishing business  the company has been exploring newer avenues like e sports and movies  In 2015  it announced the acquisition of Ireland based King Digital Entertainment  which has made it a big player in the mobile games space where so far the company had limited presence  After the King Digital buyout  there is heightened speculation that Activision will now make  smaller  bolt on  acquisitions as per media reports  At present  Activision carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations

158366,379882,EA,Esports Is The Next Billion Dollar Industry  3 Stocks To Watch,opinion,"Video games have been a staple of consumer entertainment since their earliest days  and people have always been obsessed with playing the latest games and systems  However  the advent of smartphones pushed many away from traditional gaming platforms until the latest trend  esports  brought people back in a hurry 
What Are Esports 
Esports are defined as any form of competition facilitated by electronic systems  and that typically refers to competitive video game playing  While most gamers play their favorite games as a form of leisure  professional gamers enter international tournaments  rack up sponsorships  and compete for multi million dollar prize pools 
Competitive gaming at a professional level is a relatively new concept  but it s already compiling a rabid fan base that looks very similar to those of regular sports  For the average gamer  esports offer a variety of new ways to interact with their favorite games  and following specific leagues and players passionately is becoming a regular thing 
Money to Make
Of course  when there s this level of interest in something  there s also going to be money to be made  Between the companies that develop the games and leagues  the corporate sponsors that use esports as a marketing tool  and the millions of viewers watching ad supported livestreams of events  esports is becoming a cash heavy business 
According to research from   worldwide esports related revenue was already up to  325 million in 2015  and this year s expected total was  463 million  which would represent year over year growth of 43   The same research suggests that the esports business could cross the  1 billion threshold by 2019  when total revenue is expected to be  1 1 billion 
Stocks to Watch
With all this in mind  our investor brains will remind us that we need to look out for the companies that stand to benefit the most from the esports boom 
One of these has to be Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA    In December 2015  Electronic Arts launched its  EA Competitive Gaming Division   which promised to set up leagues for its biggest titles  such as FIFA  Madden NFL  and Battlefield  In its latest   EA noted that this division is off to a hot start 
Another company to look out for is Tencent Holdings   OTC TCEHY    Tencent owns Riot Games  the developer of one of the world s most popular games  League of Legends  At the latest world championship tournament for League of Legends  worldwide viewership peaked at 14 million people  with well over 30 million people tuning in over the course of the event 
Finally  investors need to look out for Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI    Activision recently purchased a major esports company  Major League Gaming  for  46 million  and the company is looking for new ways to continue cashing in on its massive Call of Duty and Overwatch titles  ATVI announced last week that it will eventually launch its own league for Overwatch  which currently has over 20 million active users

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 42 cents on  1 08 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom and right in line on the top
EA continues to transition toward digital offerings and mobile gaming which has come at the cost of traditional packaged sales
EA has struggled in recent quarters without a new blockbuster title since Star Wars Battlefront released last year
Video game publisher  Electronic Arts  is prepared to announce its fiscal second quarter results tomorrow afternoon  EA started its fiscal 2017 on quite a sour note  delivering sharp declines on both the top and bottom line  Expectations for the upcoming quarter are equally as muted due to weak seasonality trends  Shares are trading lower the past month leading into its report tomorrow
Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 42 cents  31  lower than the same period last year  That projection has dropped 30  in the past 3 months when EA last reported  Revenue is estimated to drop 5  during the quarter to  1 08 billion  marking the second consecutive quarter of negative growth  Typically  shares tend to rise through the print but given the current downtrend  investors shouldn t be banking on making any gains 

Electronic Arts started the year on a hot streak thanks to the overwhelming success of Star Wars  Battlefront  That has since cooled off and Electronic Arts is coming off a weaker than expected FQ1 2017 printing a 53  decline on the bottom line and 2  on the top  The second quarter unfortunately doesn t fully cover the annual release of FIFA and Madden video games  These games are often two of highest grossing games year after year and typically carry quarterly results  but investors will have to wait until the third quarter
Meanwhile  smartphone owners can expect to see new versions of FIFA  Madden and even a Star Wars based game  This is a new facet that Electronic Arts had previously never recognized but is now a huge source of revenue  The biggest factor  however  is growth in digital sales and in game purchases  This new wave of digital offerings are not only convenient they also generate the highest margins  If Electronic Arts can continue to see strong growth in digital offerings then expect to see more favorable price movement ",2016-11-01,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-it-time-to-buy-electronic-arts-200161839,200161839

158395,379911,EA,Should You Buy Activision Blizzard  ATVI  Stock Ahead Of Earnings  ,opinion,"Shares of Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   gained nearly 1 2  in morning trading Thursday as the company prepares to release its third quarter 2016 earnings results after the market closes  With gaming industry competitors like Nintendo   OTC NTDOY   and Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   already reporting mixed results  all eyes will be on ATVI this afternoon 
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for earnings of  0 39 per share and revenues of  1 575 billion  It s worth noting  however  that Activision has guided for revenue of  1 490 billion  which reflects the new SEC reporting guidelines many video game companies have had to follow  The company will no longer include the impact from revenue deferrals accounting treatment on certain online enabled products 
Overall  increasing digital revenues and continued strength of the Call of Duty franchise  as well as new games like World of Warcraft  Legion and Destiny  Rise of Iron should help pad Activision Blizzard s quarterly results 
Additionally  reports from May indicated that the company s smash hit Overwatch has over 20 million users  The game will become part of ATVI s recent efforts to become a broad based media company  in addition to the launch of its new movie studio  Activision is looking to create an e sports league for Overwatch 
E sports  or professional competitive gaming  are booming  and Activision s new league could become a major revenue stream for the company  The advent of competitive gaming has brought a renewed interest to PCs  and several  competition focused  games have accrued millions of loyal fans  For more on the latest trends in the video gaming industry  check out this exclusive interview with Andrew Chanin  CEO of Pure Funds  and the Zacks Friday Finish Line team 

Looking towards this afternoon  Activision s Earnings ESP is  5 13   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 37 cents whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 39 cents  Nevertheless  Activision has proven its ability to surpass earnings expectations  with an average beat of 33 54  in the trailing four quarters 
While an earnings beat is difficult to definitively call right now  Activision s earnings report will certainly be a telling sign for the video game industry

Follow Driehaus  Rule and Invest in These 5 Momentum Stocks

	Investors with a high risk appetite have always banked on momentum strategy with high yielding potential  Richard Driehaus  a pioneer in this field  came up with a momentum strategy on the back of the  buy high and sell higher  principle  The success of Driehaus  investing strategy earned him the honor of a place in Barron s All Century Team 

	Portfolios built on Driehaus  methodology also proved to be profitable over a significant time frame  For instance  the American Association of Individual Investors   AAII  portfolio  which followed this strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500 

Driehaus  Strategy in Brief

	Regarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy 

	It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 

	Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term 

Screening Parameters

	In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential

The final Markit U S  Services PMI Index was revised to 51 4 in July from the preliminary level of 50 9  versus the expected upward revision to 51 0 and matching June s reading  The release is independent and differs from ISM s report  as it has less historic value and Markit weights its index components differently

European stocks mixed  Asia mostly lower 
European equities finished mixed amid a recovery for the recently hammered Italian banking sector and a rebound for financial listings  Oil and gas issues also moved higher  with crude oil prices rebounding from their recent tumble to bear market territory 
A favorable eurozone business activity report appeared to have a limited impact  as Markit s Eurozone Composite PMI Index a gauge of output from both the services and manufacturing sectors was revised higher to 53 2 for July  from the preliminary estimate of 52 9  where it was expected to remain  A reading above 50 denotes expansion and the index showed a slight acceleration in growth from the 53 1 level posted in June 
The euro and British pound lost ground versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mostly higher  However  conviction may have been stymied ahead of tomorrow s monetary policy decision from the Bank of England  BoE   and as the recent tumble in crude oil prices has caused global growth concerns to flare up  Bloomberg estimates are calling for the BoE to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 bps rate to 0 25  but to not expand its asset purchases 
Stocks in Asia finished lower on the heels of the declines in the U S  and Europe yesterday  which were led by the renewed drop in crude oil prices which recently fell into bear market territory  Moreover  Japanese equities dropped as the yen held onto its rally that has come courtesy of market disappointment toward Japan s latest stimulus measures in the wake of yesterday s details of its latest fiscal spending package 
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index returned to action following yesterday s weather related closure  with energy issues and property related stocks leading a decline  while mainland Chinese listings reversed early losses to close higher  South Korean stocks decreased  as did those traded in Australia  with financials leading the decline as yesterday s rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia continued to be met with a negative reaction 
Finally  Indian equities traded lower amid the recent pullback in emerging markets and some likely caution as lawmakers in the country began talks regarding a unified tax bill  per Bloomberg

158482,379998,EA,Forget Nintendo  This Gaming Stock Is Scorching The Competition,opinion,"Is it 2016  or 1996 
If I didn t know any better  I d say it was the latter  Independence Day is hitting theaters  a Clinton is running for president  and adults are scouring the earth in search of Pokemon 
If you re unfamiliar   Nintendo Ltd  Co   OTC NTDOY  has just launched the augmented reality game Pokemon Go  wherein players search for fantastical creatures   train  them  and battle against each another 
The original game was released 20 years ago when the millennial generation was in elementary or middle school 
This newest edition has been downloaded from the Apple Store by an estimated 15 million users in just over a week  according to research firm Sensor Tower 
Sensor Tower also estimates that the game is pulling in about  1 6 million a day   on iOS devices alone 
Now  to be fair  I don t  personally  play too many video games  But I do work in the financial markets 
And along with the rest of the world  I ve watched Nintendo s seemingly dead tech stock bounce more than 50  in a matter of days 
Unfortunately  most investors have already missed out on Nintendo s big move  which required the foresight that a single mobile only app game would take the gaming world like it has 
But  don t worry  There s still plenty of growth for video game stocks 
And one such opportunity is coming over the horizon now 
The Art of War
The video game industry is one of the biggest and most lucrative businesses in the world 
According to research firm Newzoo  the industry was valued at nearly  92 billion in 2015 
Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA  is one of America s largest and most profitable video game companies with some of the biggest releases in the market 
Yes  Nintendo scored a hit with Pokemon Go 
But Electronic Arts has laid waste to Nintendo shares for the better part of the last two decades 
In the last five years alone  the company has soared 227    outperforming the Nasdaq Composite by nearly three times 
And in that time frame  EA has grown earnings by a substantial 29   thanks to its diverse portfolio of games 
As you may know  EA s is home to hugely successful games like FIFA  Madden NFL  Battlefield  and Titanfall 
Now  I know to some of you  these game titles mean nothing  But these brands contributed to  4 5 billion in revenue for EA last year alone 
But it s the company s Star Wars  Battlefront franchise that helped drive the company to a monster earnings beat last quarter 
As of March 31  EA reported that it has sold 14 million copies of the game  which was released last November 
And with another potential smash hit Star Wars movie coming out this winter with another game tie in  things could get even hotter for EA 
But let s talk about why you might want to look at Electronic Arts right now 
A Small  Cheap Play on a Big Fish
For starters  its shares have just broken out of an ascending triangle chart pattern to a fresh 52 week high 
Triangle breakouts to the upside attract new money from off the sidelines  because the breakout demonstrates the bulls have gathered the resources to overcome resistance 
And because stocks trading at new highs are a beacon of strong momentum  investors often pile into shares hoping to ride the wave even higher 
These are two of the most bullish trading signals out there 
And  now that shares have pulled back slightly  a new window of entry has just opened up 
You see  over the last ten years  EA shares have tended to dip in July 
But since 2006  they ve averaged a gain of 3 61  during the month of August   the stock s second best monthly performance of the year 
To capture this potential gain  investors could simply buy shares now 
A strategic option play  however  could lower your cost basis  as well as net you a much higher profit on just a few dollars of movement on the stock 
For example  I like the EA September 2016  80 calls  currently trading around  2 65 a share  The September expiry provides plenty of time to catch the August wave 
One hundred shares of Electronic Arts costs about  7 725 at its current price 
Yet  just one of these calls   worth 100 shares   costs just  265 before commissions 
That s a 96  discount to owning the shares outright 
The options could be worth double their present value in August with a move above  82 in the underlying shares 
The likelihood that Nintendo s stock will double in that timeframe is very small 
And best of all  your total risk on the calls is limited to the amount paid for them   potentially much less than buying EA stock outright 
Bottom line  Nintendo is a crowded trade right now  But an options play on Electronic Arts captures capital flooding into gaming stocks  lowers your cost basis  and increases your profit potential 
Now that s a trade to catch

158484,380000,EA,What s In The Cards For Glu Mobile  GLUU  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Glu Mobile  Inc    NASDAQ GLUU    a developer of gaming applications for smartphones and tablets  is set to release second quarter 2016 results on Aug 2  The company reported a positive earnings surprise of 25 00  in the last reported quarter  Furthermore  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 66 97  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
GLU MOBILE INC Price and EPS Surprise
   Factors to Consider
The company s roster of celebrity games is one of its biggest positives  Its super successful game Kim Kardashian  Hollywood continues to be a top contributor to revenues  albeit slowing down   In the last reported quarter  the top line also benefitted from the launch of another celebrity game Kendall   Kylie Jenner  The to be reported quarter marked the launch of two new celebrity titles Britney Spears American Dream and Gordon Ramsay Dash  which are expected to boost the top line 
For the second quarter  Glu Mobile expects revenues in a range of  46 million to  49 million and EBITDA in a range of loss of  5 5 million to  7 million  Loss per share is expected to be in a range 5 to 6 cents 
However  growing competition from established players like Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  and Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   might make it difficult for the company to register strong growth in the near term  Further  significant investment in research and development of new games will likely be a headwind for the company and put pressure on margins 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Glu Mobile is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate andthe Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 8 cents 
Zacks Rank  Glu Mobile carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of stocks  which you may consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

158486,380002,EA,5 Things To Watch When Activision Blizzard Reports On Thursday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Activision Blizzard Inc  NASDAQ ATVI   the developer and publisher of online video games  reports Q2 earnings on Thursday August 4  after the market closes 

1  Earnings and Revenue Forecast
The Wall Street consensus regarding Activision Blizzard is an EPS of  0 45 with a top line of  1 49B  This would represent spectacular growth from the past year s 0 13  EPS and  759 million revenue  The company also raised its guidance recently  saying it now expects  1 78 EPS for the full year  Wall Street s expectations for the year are a bit higher  at  1 88  While the stock price has jumped over 50  during the past year from  25 in August 2015 to just under   40 yesterday there is still substantial growth potential for Activision Blizzard 

2  Traditional Desktop Games
The company operates as two segments  Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment  Between them  they own and publish some of the most popular gaming franchises currently available  Activision s portfolio includes the Call of Duty franchise with over  10B in sales thus far and a new release each year  Blizzard s portfolio includes the world s most massive  multiplayer online role playing game of all time  World of Warcraft  It also publishes Heathstone  an online video card game with 50 million players  plus the company s most recent hit  Overwatch  Launched in May  Overwatch was the number one selling title in June  indicating that the company isn t necessarily relying on legacy games to stay profitable 
Clearly  it continues to be capable of pumping out fresh hits  no small trick in the competitive environment in which it operates  This goes a long way toward insuring that the company should remain profitable even as the popularity of its legacy games inevitably declines  After seeing falling subscription numbers for World of Warcraft  Blizzard decided not to reveal specific numbers going forward but rather to focus on newer games  World of Warcraft s newest expansion  Legion  is scheduled to be released on August 30th and Call of Duty s latest edition  Infinite Warfare is expected to be available in November 

3  Mobile Customers
This past February  ATVI purchased mobile game maker King Digital Entertainment  for  5 9B  King publishes the widely popular game series Candy Crush  Overall  King Digital has approximately 500 million monthly users across its mobile games platform  During Q1  King Digital s contribution to Activision Blizzard s revenue was  200M  or about 23  of total earnings 
That s a drop in the bucket compared to what ATVI paid for the company  The real value King brings to ATVI hinges on two factors  its ability to monetize its user base  and perhaps more significantly  its future success at bringing additional mobile users to Activision Blizzard  Right now  all King Digital s revenue comes from one time game purchases  Once the software is purchased  additional usage is completely free as well as ad free  If King were to introduce advertising into its game platforms and King s CEO Riccardo Zacconi has hinted at this possibility as little as a dollar per user would boost the company s revenue by 250  

4  E Sports Segment
E Sports refers to the fast growing video game segment revolving around teams and competition  Most of the time  E Sports are organized video game tournaments with an audience watching whether in physical proximity or remotely via computer or TV  The segment is seeing robust growth  and the  325 million in revenue generated industry wide through E Sports in 2015 is expected to rise to  463 million in 2016 
The 2015 League of Legends World Championship Final drew more than 36 million unique viewers over the course of the championship final  Major League Baseball s World Series Game 5 drew 17 million viewers  The National Basketball Association Finals  Game 7 was watched by 31 million people  The combined viewership for hockey s six game Stanley Cup series was a little over 23 million  Activision recently purchased the E Sports platform Major League Gaming  MLG   for  46M  Through MLG  the company intends to set up a gaming television channel  in order to capitalize on the popularity of E Sports  while growing momentum both through its games and its viewership 

5  Movie Studio
Activision Blizzard appears to be doing everything in its power to make sure that no money gets left on the table  It has even managed to monetize one of its most popular series  World of Warcraft  through the June 10 US premier of the movie Warcraft  While the movie wasn t a blockbuster in the States  grossing only  47M  it was a hit in China  where it grossed over  200M  Worldwide it brought in over  430M in revenue 
ATVI has already announced its next production  a movie based on its popular game Call of Duty  It s also exploring the possibility of a sequel to Warcraft  The Hollywood Reporter  that Warcraft s online streaming rights for the Chinese market have sold for a record sum for a foreign title  though exact figures were not disclosed  Its US debut may not have been exactly stellar  but the movie s international success undoubtedly strengthened the World of Warcraft brand overall 
Conclusion
Currently  the company trades for  39 75 a share  with a P E ratio of 35  However  the company recently raised guidance for 2016 to  1 78  taking the forward P E to an acceptable 22 
One thing we really like about ATVI is the industry in which it operates  The gaming universe continues to expand  According to a recent report  42  of Americans play video games for 3 hours or more per week  and while hard core desktop gamers are predominantly young males between 13 30  more casual  mobile gamers range across all ages and genders 
With a  29B market cap  ATVI is bigger than its nearest competitor Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   which publishes FIFA and Battlefield  and is now valued at  23B  We believe Activision Blizzard is extremely well positioned to take advantage of gamer engagement and growth  Its purchase of King Digital indicates it s in tune with the expanding mobile gaming trend  expected to  through 2019  It is also on top of the growing E Sports industry  as its acquisition of Major League Gaming indicates  With a solid and loyal core of legacy followers  the proven ability to continue creating hits  and the management savvy to recognize and capitalize on growth opportunities  Activision Blizzard should easily be able to continue its impressive upward price momentum ",2016-08-04,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-to-watch-when-activision-blizzard-reports-on-thursday-200145948,200145948
158534,380050,EA,Can The Uptrend Continue For Electronic Arts  EA  ,opinion,"Investors certainly have to be happy with Electronic Arts Inc    NASDAQ EA   and its short term performance  After all  the stock has jumped by 15 3  in the past 4 weeks  and it is also above its 20 Day Simple Moving Average as well  This is certainly a good trend  but investors are probably asking themselves  can this positive trend continue for EA 
While we can never know for sure  it is pretty encouraging that estimates for EA have moved higher in the past few weeks  meaning that analyst sentiment is moving in the right way  Plus  the stock actually has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   so the recent move higher for this spotlighted company may definitely continue over the next few weeks ",2016-05-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-the-uptrend-continue-for-electronic-arts-(ea)-200132165,200132165
158535,380051,EA,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Electronic Arts  EA   ,opinion,"Electronic Arts Inc    NASDAQ EA   is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective  as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for EA broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting a short term bullish trend 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved higher by 23 6  in the past four weeks  Plus  the company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting that now could definitely be the time for this breakout candidate 
More bullishness may especially be the case when investors consider what has been happening for EA on the earnings estimate revision front lately  No estimate has gone lower in the past two months  compared to 2 higher  while the consensus estimate has also moved higher too 
So given this move in estimates  and the positive technical factors  investors may want to watch this breakout candidate closely for more gains in the near future ",2016-05-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert:-electronic-arts-(ea)-200133437,200133437
158536,380052,EA,5 Top ROE Stocks To Profit In Turbulent Times,opinion,"A better than expected first quarter GDP estimate and U S  dollar strength led the Fed Chair Janet Yellen to signal an imminent interest rate hike  However  a strengthening U S  dollar might halt the bullish run of the S P 500 as it could potentially impact the oil market and emerging market assets 
In such a topsy turvy market  where money can play a key role in surviving carnage  investors look for  cash cow  stocks to milk more cash or profits 
However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return 
ROE  The Time Tested VariableROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder 
Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns 
Screening Parameters to Rake Moolah
In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  However  these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks in a turbulent market  As such  we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy to mint money   
Price Cash Flow less than X Industry This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock 
Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets  which include cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 
5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength   
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
Here are 5 of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening 
Altria Group  NYSE MO   Inc    
Braskem S A    
Lear Corp    
Electronic Arts Inc   NASDAQ EA    
Shire plc   
With an enviable cash pile  these stocks appear to be enterprising picks when they are blended with other attractive features like high ROE  high ROA and solid historical earnings growth along with a solid Zacks Rank

	The companies involved in this transfer of gaming to mobile are seeing benefits in the form of solid revenue and EPS growth  Below I list three companies that are taking advantage of the mobile consumer and are either Zacks Ranked  1 Strong Buy  or  2 Buy  stocks Netease    is a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy  that is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications  services and other technologies for the Internet in China  The company partners with Blizzard Entertainment and also provides email  ecommerce  and advertising services  The Beijing based company was founded in 1997 and has almost 13 000 employees

A lot of the recent news flow about oil has been centered on production shutdowns as a result of wildfires in Alberta and disruptions out of Libya  Nigeria and elsewhere  These offline volumes should help with the commodity s supply overhang in the near term  but we will be back to over supplied market conditions once these barrels are back on the market in the coming weeks  As such  they are unlikely to have any enduring impact on oil s long term supply demand fundamentals 
The more lasting impact on oil prices is what is happening to production from the U S  Shale basins  which have steadily been coming down since last year  with the pace of production declines expected to accelerate this year and beyond  The recent rise in oil prices slows down that process to some extent  but the process of declines from shale fields will likely continue given reduced access to capital for many oil producers 
The only rational explanation for the stock market s lock step movement with oil prices is we view the commodity as a play on the health of the global economy  As such  it would only make sense for stocks to follow oil when it was moving higher as a result of improved global demand  That s not the case at present  as we explained earlier  a lot of the recent oil momentum has been supply driven 
Beyond oil  we have reached the final stage of Q1 earnings season  with the Retail sector as the only with any sizable number of reports still pending  Disney    and Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA     will be reporting after the close today  but we have already seen Q1 results 447 S P 500 members or 89 4  of the index s total membership 
Total earnings for these 447 index members are down  7 4  from the same period last year on  1 4  lower revenues  with 71 1  beating EPS estimates and 55 7  coming ahead of top line expectations 
As we have been saying all along this reporting cycle  the proportion of companies beating estimates has been tracking above historical levels in Q1 though growth has been notably on the weak side  Estimates for the current period  2016 Q2  have been coming down  with Q2 total earnings for the index now expected to be down  5 7  from the same period last year on  0 9  lower revenues  which will be the 5th quarter in a row of earnings declines

158601,380117,EA,Zynga Climbs On CEO Shakeup,opinion,"ZNGA Has Faced Some Very Big Problems
Zynga  NASDAQ ZNGA  created a blockbuster game known as Farmville years ago that put them on the map  However  since then  we haven t seen much from the company  Sure  there have been games  but none of them have been very addictive  A while ago  the company announced that it is working to develop two games that are likely to be big hits  Those games are  CSR2  and  Dawn of Titans   However  because the company has seen a few games flop at this point  they are relatively strapped for cash  In fact  the company is selling  530 million main office in an attempt to free up some cash flow  So  all in all  ZNGA has one big problem    thus far  it is relatively similar to a one hit wonder musician  and at this point  cash is running out 
ZNGA CEO Shakeup
Ultimately  any time a company isn t doing well  it falls on the company s CEO  Without strong leadership  we won t see much positivity  So it s no surprise that ZNGA founder Mark Pincus has made the decision to step down from the company as CEO  This move will be effective on March 7 when Pincus will become the executive chairman and Frank Gibeau will be made the new CEO of the company  Gibeau has more than 20 years of experience in the gaming industry with Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   Most recently  Gibeau served as the executive Vice President of EA Mobile  So  his history shows that he may have the ability to turn the company around  In a statement  Pincus had the following to say   
 I recruited Frank seven months ago to become an active board member to advise and coach our teams     W e have worked well together and share a common vision for Zynga around mobile and social gaming  
Following up  Gibeau had the following to say   
 Dispite the success of mobile games  Mark and I believe that the full promise of Zynga and social gaming has yet to be fully realized    We believe that Zynga has an opportunity to create new social experiences to connect even more players together  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  In this case  we re talking very big news  You see  investors have been worried about ZNGA for quite some time  The company just couldn t seem to find solid footing  It s often that we see founders stepping down to bring in CEOs because it s the right thing to do  In this case  it definitely is the right thing to do  and investors are applauding the decision  Currently  10 12   ZNGA is trading at  2 29 per share after a gain of  0 12 per share or 5 79  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See From ZNGA Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively bearish opinion of what we can expect to see  While it is good that the company has named a new CEO  ZNGA is cash strapped  and that will likely lead to further struggles down the road  However  I will admit that the company does have the ability to create a blockbuster if it can only get the funding going  Really  I think that a lot of the company s success is going to ride on the sale of their main office  That  530 million could go a long way when it comes to paying employees to get the games in the works up and running quickly  So  in the long run  there s definitely potential  However  in the short term  I d definitely stay away ",2016-03-02,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zynga-(znga)-stock-climbs-on-ceo-shakeup-200120166,200120166

158603,380119,EA,What To Expect From Glu Mobile  GLUU  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Glu Mobile  Inc    NASDAQ GLUU    a developer of gaming applications for smartphones and tablets  is set to release first quarter 2016 results on May 3  The company reported a positive earnings surprise of 71 43  in the last reported quarter  Furthermore  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 85 72  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
The launch of Kendall   Kylie Jenner game this February was well received initially but seems to failed to sustain the momentum  Moreover  it s super successful game Kim Kardashian  Hollywood continues to be a top contributor to revenues  albeit slowing down  
We remain positive regarding the video game publishers  much hyped celebrity games  The company has inked a number of deals with the likes of Britney Spears  Nicki Minaj and more It remains to be seen whether the company can repeat the success of Kim Kardashian with other releases like Nicki Minaj for summer 2016 and a Taylor Swift game in Dec 2016 
However  growing competition from established players like Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA   and Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   might make it difficult for the company to register strong growth in the near term  Further  significant investment in research and development of new games will likely be a headwind for the company  putting pressure on margins 
For the first quarter  Glu Mobile expects revenues in a range of  46 million to  48 million and EBITDA in a range of loss of  6 million to  7 million  Loss per share is expected to be in a range 5 to 6 cents  Contribution from branded IPs will increase to 57  
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Glu Mobile is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is  12 50   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 9 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at a loss of 8 cents 
Zacks Rank  Glu Mobile carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Though Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stock to Consider
Here is a company  which you may consider  as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

158605,380121,EA,Is Zynga In Trouble This Quarter ,opinion,"Zynga Inc  NASDAQ ZNGA  Information Technology   Software   Reports May 4  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for a 1 cent loss on the bottom line and revenue expectations of  164 58 million
 has failed to release a hit game following the booming success of FarmVille
Two of the company s most important metrics  daily active user  DAUs  and monthly active users  MAUs  have plunged as the company searches for a new growth catalyst
Mobile game manufacturer Zynga is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Wednesday  after the market closes  Zynga has benefitted from strength in the mobile gaming market  beating revenue in each quarter of fiscal 2015 
Unfortunately  the stock hasn t tracked earnings and is down 12 5  since the start of the year  Lately  earnings have also suffered  with Zynga failing to turn a profit in the last 2 fiscal years  Expectations are relatively low ahead of earnings as estimates have been cut 16  and sales 7  
As a result  Zynga is looking for a 1 cent loss on  164 58 million in revenue according to the Estimize consensus  Compared to a year earlier  this represents a 10  increase on the bottom line  while sales are expected to decline 9  
Given Zynga s volatile earnings  it s not surprising that the stock typically drops 2  through earnings  Due to the nature of the gaming market  Zynga s success hinges on whether or not they can release a new viral game 


Despite coming off a positive earnings and revenue surprise in Q3 2015  those results aren t expected again for the foreseeable future  The company has failed to release a hit game since their FarmVille and Texas HoldEm Poker games  Since Zynga s partnership with Facebook  NASDAQ FB  ended  even its flagship game  FarmVille  has decreased in popularity  after hitting a peak of 80M players in 2010 
Two of the company s most important metrics  daily active user  DAUs  and monthly active users  MAUs   have plunged as the company searches for a new growth catalyst  In Q4  DAUs were down 24  YoY while MAUs were down 30  
Meanwhile  Zynga faces intensifying competition from Glu Mobile  NASDAQ GLUU   Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   and King Digital  Fortunately  highly anticipated games in CSR2 and Dawn of Titans were released this quarter and should help bolster Zynga s portfolio of games

158606,380122,EA,Activision Is Waging War On The Gaming Industry,opinion,"Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  Information Technology   Software  Reports May 5  After Market Closes
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 15 cents on  823 85 million in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  6 million on the top
Activision s acquisition of King Digital immediately makes them a major player in the highly profitable mobile gaming industry
Activision is poised to benefit from a new Call of Duty game and World of Warcraft movie set to hit the market later this year
What are you expecting for  
Popular video game publisher  Activision Blizzard  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings today  after the market closes  Activision is best known for the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero games  among others  Despite the relative strength of the gaming industry  Activision is coming off a worse than expected quarter  That said  earnings have largely tracked expectations over the past 2 years  The fourth quarter featured a number of strategic initiatives that should pay off in this report and throughout the rest of the year
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 15 cents on  823 85 million in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  4 million on the top  Since its last report per share estimates have come down 18  with sales increasing 8   This reflects an 8  decline in EPS compared to a year earlier while revenue is expected to climb 17   If 50  returns in the past 12 months weren t enough  Activision is a positive mover through earnings  The stock often experiences its biggest gain of 4  in the 30 days following its report 

This big news last quarter was Activision s acquisition of mobile gaming company King Digital Entertainment  King Digital is the maker of the wildly popular mobile game Candy Crush  and its other iterations  The company s cash cows today are console and PC games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft  so its emergence in mobile gaming adds an important third revenue stream  This year  mobile gaming surpassed both console and PC games as the most profitable segment in the industry 
Meanwhile  the company s flagship products have also been in the news  The newest Call of Duty game was recently announced to hit the market this November  just in time for the holiday season  Additionally  the first World of Warcraft movie is prepared to hit the big screen this summer which could help drive game sales  Apart from just video games  Activision is making strides to become a broad based media company  The company recently launched a movie studio and is now making its presence in the emerging e sports market 
Nonetheless  Activision still operates in a highly competitive market against traditional powerhouses in Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  and up in coming companies like Glu Mobile Inc  NASDAQ GLUU  and Zynga Inc  NASDAQ ZNGA   The higher adoption of freemium games  weak economic outlook and over reliance on major franchises add to the company s uncertainties

158619,380135,EA,5 Stocks To Watch  COP  DFS  EA  JAZZ  PKG,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
ConocoPhillips  N COP 
ConocoPhillips started lower in May and then support in July  It fell hard from there to bottom with the market in August  After a quick bounce  it consolidated between 46 and 48 for September before moving higher in October  A touch at 56 knocked it back a little into consolidation  but it is back at resistance again  With a bullish RSI and rising MACD  watch for a break of resistance to enter 
Discover Financial  N DFS 
Discover Financial went through a long sideways consolidation from March until August  when it fell lower  It consolidated in a range  like the market  in September  before moving higher 2 weeks ago  The rise met resistance at the top of the August range and was knocked back slightly  but is moving back to that high again  It has support for more upside from the rising and bullish RSI and MACD 
Electronic Arts  O EA 
Electronic Arts has been a strong stock moving in a trend higher all year  It took a hit when the market fell in August  and has been recovering in an ascending triangle since  Friday saw it press up against the top of that triangle  As it hits there  the RSI is rising into the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  both supporting more upside 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals  O JAZZ 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals had been in a slowly rising trend until it started lower in August  The stock bounced after the August market bottom but then quickly resumed its path lower until the end of September  Since then it has been building higher lows against resistance  and peeked over the top on Friday  The RSI is moving up and near a push through the mid line with the MACD rising 
Packaging Corporation of America  N PKG 
Packaging Corporation of America made a top in February and then fell back in a couple of steps in to a low to start July  The bounce from there just cleared the prior high and moved into the gap before failing and reversing lower again in August  A second step lower in September was bought quickly and it has risen fast since  The RSI is bullish and the MACD rising in support of a break of the current consolidation to the upside 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  with October Options Expiration behind sees the Equity Markets looking stronger 
Elsewhere look for gold to pullback in the short term in its uptrend  while crude oil rises  The US dollar index is biased lower in consolidation  while US Treasuries have a short term bias higher in their consolidation  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with risk of the Emerging Markets hitting long term resistance 
Volatility is back to the normal range and falling putting the bias higher for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  After strong back halves of the week  the SPY and QQQ look as if they may be ready to reverse the downward August trend and resume higher  while the IWM remains in a consolidation zone  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

158631,380147,EA,China Rising Or Not  ,opinion,"Things have certainly changed since I was a child  When I was growing up my father would come outside to give the traditional  dinner whistle   As was often the case  the common response was  Can we play for five more minutes  Please  
Times have certainly changed  Today  my  dinner whistle  is often met with 

 Coming  just let me get to save point  

My kids are huge fans of the Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   Battlefield  series of multiplayer military warfare games  The other night  one of the downloadable content  DLC  maps on which they were playing caught my attention  It was entitled  China Rising   
Had it not been for the recent headlines of the Shanghai index  it would have likely gone unnoticed  However  given the collapse in the index of nearly 30  over the last month  and the potential implications for domestic economy and markets  I thought it was most apropos 
China Rising  Well  it was  And this last week  we saw what the perils of a leveraged market can be when things go  inevitably wrong  

 The perils of margin debt should not be readily dismissed  For a real time example of financial market leverage and consequences  one needs to look no further than the Shanghai Index in China  That market is in a complete collapse as plunging prices are forcing investors to sell shares  While the Chinese government has injected liquidity  suspended trading in almost half of the listed equities and encouraged pension funds to buy securities  these actions have done little to stem the decline as investors  panic sell  in a rush to safety  That collapse  if history is any guide  is likely not done as shown in the chart below  



 Also  notice the correlation between peaks in the Shanghai Index and the S P 500  According to a  margin debt in China reached  264 Billion in April of this year  After adjusting for the size of the two markets  is about double that of the roughly  500 billion in margin debt in the U S 
This difference in relative size was given as a prime example about how margin debt is not a problem for the U S  However  the relative size of margin debt in the past has not been a  safety net  that investors should rely on  As shown  the level of real  inflation adjusted  margin debt as a percentage of real GDP has reached levels only witnessed at the peaks of the last two financial bubble peaks in the U S  



 While no single indicator should be relied upon as a measure to manage a portfolio  it should be well understood by now that leverage is a  double edged sword   While rising margin debt levels provide the additional liquidity to drive stock prices higher on the way up  it also cuts deeply as prices fall  

This weekend s reading list is a collection of analysis as to the potential impact of the deflating of the Chinese bubble  Will the interventions by the Chinese government stem the tide of selling or only postpone it  More importantly  is history set to repeat itself   China Rising  may have been the sound of the  sound of the bell  being rung for the bull market that begin in 2009  While it is too early to know for certain  at least things are getting a bit more interesting  Let s just try and get to a  save point  first 
1  The Greek Crisis Is Nothing Compared To China 

 Why does this matter to people outside of China  A rapidly sinking stock market is often a sign of an economy in turmoil  Remember 2008  And 2000 
Since China is the second largest trading partner for both Europe and the United States  it goes without saying that a healthy Chinese economy is good news for the developed world  All that talk about the possibility of Greek contagion if it is forced to drop the euro and bring back the drachma  That seems overdone too 
Economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland  LONDON RBS  tweeted out a chart last week that showed that U S  banks have nearly ten times as much exposure to China than Greece

2  Why Beijing Cannot Let Its Bull Market Die 

 So this takes us to the current point where controlling the market has been elevated to a test of strength for Beijing and its state led model 
In China  it shouldn t be too much of a stretch to believe that the government has the ability to control stock prices through force of will  Beijing has a long history of being able to bend market forces to meet its ends   from interest rates  currency values and the movement of capital in its captive financial system 
But as shares continue to slide regardless of government action  investors are increasingly not buying the government line and  more ominously for President Xi Jinping  they are less willing to believe that he and the party are indeed all powerful 
To get a sense of what the wider fallout from a correction could be  it helps to compare China now to its previous equity boom and bust in 2007

3  China s Big Misquided Gamble On Its Stock Market  

 In real market economies  stock crashes of such magnitude may cause heartburn but unlikely precipitate frenzied government efforts to prop up equity prices  But China is  as we know  not exactly a market economy and has a government that acts differently  In response to the latest crash  instead of allowing market forces to self correct  Beijing is rolling out aggressive measures to keep the bubble from popping completely 
Beijing should be building social safety nets and recapitalizing its banks  not betting the house on a stock market bubble

 While some of the post Greferendum moves in financial markets could have been and were predicted by the financial punditry   lower euro  lower stocks  lower US bond yields  higher gold   the real moves have appeared elsewhere  Indeed  as of this writing the euro is only lower against the USD by less than  5   the MSCI World Index is barely off by 1   bonds are bid  but not emphatically  and gold is only marginally higher 
The real moves have been in oil  WTI down 6 3  and Brent down 5   and copper  down 3 9    While at first glance this may strike one as odd  there could be something larger at work  Perhaps the more important catalyst for asset price changes of late is Chinese economic slowing rather than fears of Grexit

 As I ve written many times  China  Brazil  Russia and other emerging markets are suffering through secular bear markets that will last years  Since Chinese stocks represent more than 20  of some emerging markets ETFs  the pain will likely continue well into this decade 
Secular bear markets feature sudden  violent rallies and mini bull markets that fool people into thinking they re the genuine article  In real bull markets  indexes repeatedly top their previous highs  in bear markets  they never do

158632,380148,EA,Not All Gaming Stocks Are Winners,opinion,"Let s face it  kids aren t playing with toys anymore these days  they re playing with mobile devices  In recent years  sales of Barbie dolls and Matchbox cars have deteriorated  leaving traditional toy companies like Mattel  NASDAQ MAT  in the dust  Classic toys are being left on the shelf  while not only children  but adults  increasingly spend more time playing with entertainment apps and social video games  but does the popularity of these apps mean you should invest in them 
The gaming industry is a battle of blockbusters  A single big hit can drive years of profitability for a game studio  This is true for both mobile game companies such as King Digital Entertainment  NYSE KING  and Zynga  NASDAQ ZNGA   as well as their console game counterparts such as Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA  and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   However  there are a few key differences between these two spectrums of the gaming market that makes one a less risky investment 

 Note  KING s EPS and revenue growth rates are only based on FQ1 2015 as the company IPO d in FQ1 2014 
A Hits Only Model
The mobile games landscape is solely a  hits  business  A hit can allow companies like King to run up huge valuations in an initial public offering if they produce one smash hit  often debuting on the stock exchange to much fanfare  But at the end of the day they will need use all of the cash they raise to hire an army of developers and they d better come up with something at least as good as the game that got them there  There is a huge risk involved when new entertainment app and games companies take the King approach to go public because the majority of games made are commercial flops  and they can be expensive to produce  These gaming studios believed they could take customers from one game and use them as the marketing funnel for the next game in order to save on building a whole new funnel  rolling people over from game to game in perpetuity  They are finding out that this approach doesn t work 
The business model for mobile games entails getting a user to download a game for free  then up selling them on frequent inexpensive micro transactions  Over the past few years King and Zynga s respective flagship franchises  Candy Crush and FarmVille  have been monstrously successful employing this strategy  However  now these companies need to expand and diversify their revenue sources as the popularity of their hit games inevitably declines  In one year  Candy Crush went from making up 78  of King Digital s revenue to 45   However  the number of paying customers continues to shrink  even as the monthly active user  MAU  count is increasing and the average spend per paying customer is growing  From Q1 2014 to Q1 2015  King s quarterly average monthly unique payers dropped to 8 5 million from 11 8 million 
Similarly  Zynga s Farmville hit a peak of 80M users in 2010  and has been on the decline ever since as they struggle produce another popular game  And the other thing in a freefall   their stock  Since IPO ing in late 2011  and beating their initial earnings expectations in Q1 2012  the stock peaked at  14 69 and has fallen over 80  since then  King too has seen their stock decline since IPO ing last year  albeit at a more modest 20   Fundamentals have also been disappointing  with both companies putting up several quarters of negative top and bottom line growth 
The Video Game Franchise
Video game companies on the other hand  while they also rely on hits  have the ability to build game franchises  which draw loyal followers  Unlike the freemium model mobile game companies employ  these video games titles tend to go for  50  and are played on traditional gaming platforms such as Xbox and Playstation  Two of the most popular gaming franchises on the market are Call of Duty produced by Activision Blizzard and Grand Theft Auto produced by Take Two Interactive  Company fundamentals often rely on the release of the next version of these games  Take the latest installment of Call of Duty  Advanced Warfare  released in November of 2014  Third quarter earnings saw growth of 188  as a result  and revenues of 78   Similarly  Grand Theft Auto V was released in September 2013  and boosted earnings for Q3 and Q4 of that year into the triple digits  with revenues not far behind  The popularity of these games hasn t waned  with many gamer forums debating the release of the next installments with great anticipation 
Despite the challenges faced by mobile gaming companies  that space is expected to grow to  45B by 2015  The challenge for mobile gaming studios will be to increase the number of customers who actually pay to play freemium games as well as to stave off competition  The barriers to entry are very low in this space  with new competitors entering everyday  and the landscape is becoming increasingly crowded ",2015-08-04,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-all-gaming-stocks-are-winners-260523,260523
158650,380166,EA,Calendar Vol Diff Opens  But What About Earnings  ,opinion,Electronic Arts Inc  develops  markets  publishes and distributes game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of video game machines and electronic devices  platforms  This is a quick vol note  specifically a calendar spread I noticed   but with a twist  The back month has earnings  a vol event  embedded in the options Let s start with the Skew Tab from today to examine the line by line and month to month vols Note that I have excluded the September options and am only focusing on the October and December expiries  We can see that the ATM vols  13 and 14 strikes  are depressed in October relative to December  But  as we walk further up the skew  we can see that the OTM calls in October are in fact priced higher than the OTM calls in December  in terms of vol  The tricky thing here is that the next earnings release for EA should be at the end of October but outside of October expiry  In English  the December options have a vol event that October does not  yet the OTM calls in December are less expensive  in terms of vol  than the OTM calls in October  And that  is a fancy little trick I took a look back at the historical skew for EA and as late as 8 27 2012  the skew shape did not exhibit this phenomenon  I have included that Skew Tab  below While there s a hint of higher vol in the 17 strike  for the most part  all of October lies below December   which is expected  given the earnings event Let s turn to the Charts Tab  six months   below  The top portion is the stock price  the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs  HV20    blue vs  HV180    pink  On the stock side we can see how EA was in a bit of a free fall for the four months ending in late July  Since hitting a closing low of  11 02 on 7 31 2012  the stock is up 23 4  as of this writing   so a nice rebound On the vol side we can see how the implied rises and falls with earnings  which is normal  But more recently we can see that spike in the IV30  and then a bit of a dip  On 8 24 2012 the implied closed at 38 16  and rose to as high as 53 59   a 40  rise  one week later  The IV30  has dipped since then to 47 62   but it s still elevated to that 8 24 2012 level and is certainly elevated to the historically realized measures  HV20  and HV180   The 52 wk range in IV30  for EA is  33 66   63 17    putting the current level in the 47th percentile Finally  let s turn to the options Tab for completeness Across the top we can see that October vol is priced to 46 37  while December is priced to 47 22   But  as we saw in the skew chart  moving to the OTM calls  we can see that the vol in October is above December  In fact  that same phenomenon exists in September As just one example  we can see on the 17 strike vols of 69 94   52 15  and 44 75   respectively for September  October and December  An interesting position to analyze would be the September December OTM call spread  then if September expires worthless  to roll that into an October December call spread  all the while owning cheaper vol than selling while owning the earnings event  Just to be clear  I m not recommending this trade  I m pointing out a cool vol phenomenon  namely OTM call elevated vol outside of earnings relative to an expiry with earnings Disclaimer  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-09-07,Ophir Gottlieb,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/calendar-vol-diff-opens,-but-what-about-earnings-135567",135567
