Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  and welcome to the Cardinal Health  Inc  Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call   Operator Instructions  At this time  I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran  Please go ahead Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsGood morning  and thank you for joining us as we discuss Cardinal Health second quarter fiscal 2020 results  I m Kevin Moran  Vice President of Investor Relations  And joining me today are Mike Kaufmann  our Chief Executive Officer  and Dave Evans  our Interim Chief Financial Officer  You can find today s press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir cardinalhealth com During the call  we will be making forward looking statements  The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied  Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties During the discussion today  our comments  including an update to our FY  20 outlook  will be on a non GAAP basis  unless they are specifically called out as GAAP  GAAP to non GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release  During the Q A portion of today s call  we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow up so that we can try and get everyone an opportunity to ask a question With that  I ll now turn the call over to Mike Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  and thanks for joining us  Before we discuss our Q2 performance and our outlook for the year  I would like to reiterate a few things we shared last Thursday regarding voluntary recalls or any Level 3 surgical gowns and certain Presource Packs containing those affected gowns  The full press release and additional information regarding this issue can be found on our website First and foremost  we apologize to our customers and their patients  We understand the gravity of this situation and are dedicated to resolving this issue as quickly as possible  Simultaneously  we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again  We are engaging third party experts to conduct a comprehensive review of our quality assurance processes and business practices  and we are committed to executing corrective and preventative actions As we shared last week related to these recalls  we recorded a  96 million charge in our Q2 GAAP results  This charge represents our best estimate of cost for the recalls  including inventory write offs as well as certain remediation and supply disruption costs such as cost to replace recall products  To provide some clarity   56 million of this is within cost of products sold and  40 million is within SG A  This charge in any future adjustments made to it will be excluded from our non GAAP financial results  On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health leadership team  I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and tireless effort  all of us  myself included  are focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible for our customers and their patients I ll now turn the call over to Dave to walk through our Q2 results and updated fiscal  20 outlook  And then  I ll share some thoughts on our path forward David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Mike  I ll start with an overview of our performance for the second fiscal quarter and then provide an update to our fiscal  20 guidance  In Q2  we delivered earnings of  1 52 per share  an increase of 18  from the prior year  This result exceeded our expectations and was driven by a combination of operating and non operating activities  which I ll elaborate on the comments to follow  Total Company revenue increased 5  versus last year to  39 7 billion  and consolidated gross margin increased 2  from last year to  1 8 billion SG A increased 3  to  1 1 billion  This increase was driven by higher cost to support sales growth and by fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities  These items were partially offset by the benefits of enterprisewide cost savings measures  The net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of  646 million  a 1  increase from the prior year Moving below operating earnings  interest and other income and expense decreased 48  to  51 million  This was primarily driven by the change in value of deferred compensation plan investments and lower interest expense as we continue to execute our deleveraging plans  Of note  in the quarter  we paid down more than  700 million of long term debt and have now paid down nearly  800 million through the first half  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25   nearly 4 percentage points lower than the prior year  primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix  Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million  about 6 million fewer than last year  During the quarter  we completed the  350 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q1  We repurchased 7 3 million shares over the first two quarters and an average value of  48 per share  We now have  943 million remaining under our Board authorized share repurchase program Moving on to cash flow  Operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately  700 million  We ended the quarter with a cash balance of  1 7 billion  which included  788 million held outside the US  As a reminder  timing  in particular  the day of the week in which the quarter ends  affects point in time cash flows Moving on to segment results  starting with Pharma  We were encouraged to see positive momentum across many areas of the segment  Segment revenue increased 6  to  35 7 billion  driven by growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions  Segment profit increased 4  to  462 million  with our generics program being the largest driver  As a reminder  what we refer to our    as our generics program includes sourcing  sell side pricing  volume and new item launches  For the first time in several quarters  our generics program reverted from a net earnings headwind to tailwind  At the same time  we continue to see strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business  Brand sales and mix also positively contribute as we manage changing dynamics to capture the value we create through our supply chain  These tailwinds were partially offset by pharma distribution customer contract renewals Transitioning to Medical  revenue for the segment was flat to prior year at  4 billion  Growth in Cardinal Health at Home was offset by a decline in products and distribution  As a reminder  products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products  Overall  Cardinal Health brand volumes have lagged their expectations through the first half  While we recognize we still have progress to make  this validates the importance of our commercial initiatives  which Mike will discuss in his remarks  Medical segment profit increased 4  to  195 million  This reflects the benefits of ongoing initiatives to improve our cost structure  including work to optimize freight and IT relationships  These benefits were partially offset by a decline in products and distribution  Medical segment profits are now up 13  compared to fiscal  19 on a year to date basis Moving now to our full year outlook  With half the year behind us  we are raising our full year fiscal  20 EPS guidance to the range of  5 20 to  5 40 from the prior range of  4 85 to  5 10  I ll call out a few items contributing to this increase  First  we now have additional clarity regarding external factors we mentioned last quarter that affect the enterprise  including brand inflation  the medical device tax and tariffs  Also based on the sustained improved trends in our generics program  we now expect to the Pharma segment to exceed our original expectations for the full year A few additional items to note in the Pharma segment as we look to the second half of the year  First from a year over year comparison perspective  recall that it was in Q4 of last year when we started to see an improvement in the generic market dynamics  That means we ll be comping more challenging performance in Q4 of this year  Second  we now expect opioid related legal costs to be in the range of  100 million to  125 million for the year  with the majority of the year over year increase occurring in the back half of the year  As a reminder  these expenses are recorded in our Pharma segment  Third  on brand inflation  while the January price increases from our contingent vendors fell within the range of our expectations  they continue to be a smaller dollar contribution each year And in Medical  I ll remind you of the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal  19 related to Cordis  This will affect our year over year growth rate in the second half for the segment  Regarding the rest of our corporate assumptions  we now anticipate FY  20 interest and other income and expense in the range of  260 million to  280 million  This improvement is largely due to the favorability we ve seen thus far with our deferred compensation plan investments and the benefits of debt deleveraging I mentioned earlier As a reminder  we plan to reduce outstanding long term debt by at least  1 billion in fiscal  20  Finally  we expect diluted weighted shares    average shares to be in the range of 293 million to 296 million for the full fiscal year  Given that we are halfway through the year  we ve decided to narrow this range Regarding our segment assumptions  we are making one update  With the favorability I discussed  we now expect Pharmaceutical segment profit to decline low single digits  This is a significant improvement from our original expectation of a low double digit decline With that  let me turn it back over to Mike Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Dave  As we look to the remainder of this year and the next few  we will continue to focus on enhancing our established core businesses and on fueling sustained growth in evolving areas  including specialty and at home In Pharma  let me start by saying we continue to be actively involved in ongoing negotiations of the terms for a global settlement  and we remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic  Overall  we have increased confidence in our work to drive growth across the Pharma segment  Our investments in our generic pricing and analytics capabilities as well as continued strong performance from Red Oak and improving market dynamics are enabling our generics program to now be a tailwind for the year  rather than a headwind as we previously expected  Also  our investments in both our specialty and connected care businesses enable us to capture value in the ever changing healthcare landscape Moving to Medical  I mentioned last quarter that we had multiple initiatives in place to enhance our commercial approach and streamline our supply chain  Our work in these areas continues  However  with the recent recalls  we are currently deploying our Medical segment teams to meet the most immediate needs of our customers and their patients  While we recognize this will slow momentum in our commercial and supply chain initiatives  we remain confident in the underlying strategies of these work streams  and we are dedicated to their success  We will provide an update on our next call At the enterprise level  we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business  maintaining a strong balance sheet and modestly growing our dividend  Opportunistically  we will continue to explore share repurchases and M A  Across the Company  we continue to prudently manage our cost structure  We re doing this through focusing our resources  improving our processes and embracing new technologies that create better visibility and velocity throughout the Company  Our goal is to be easier to do business with  As this new mindset takes root  we will continue to see a sustainable behavioral shift and ongoing value creation for years to come With that  I ll now pause to open it up for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And we ll take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim Glen Santangelo    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystYeah  thanks  Good morning  Just a quick question regarding the guidance in the Medical segment  I m kind of curious as the recall have any implications for the outlook in the second half of the year  because if you look through the first six months  operating profit is already up double digits and Dave  as you sort of alluded to  you have that easy comp coming in the fourth quarter from that charge last year  So by maintaining the guidance there  we kind of implies that the operating performance would be pretty weak in the second half  I m just kind of curious if I m looking at that correctly or if there is anything else there David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Glen  this is Dave  Good question  So we    as you could see  we collected direct costs  include those in our charge of  96 million  What we have uncertainty on and frankly at this very early stage is implications to second half in terms of revenue  margin and any disruptions with our customers  So I would say that you ve read this fairly well and that we ve reflected some of that uncertainty in the guidance that we re providing for the second half for Med Glen Santangelo    Guggenheim Securities    AnalystOkay  And then maybe if I just ask a quick follow up to Mike with respect to opioids  I think you were sort of forecasting about  85 million of expenses and now you ve taken your opioid litigation expenses up to  100 million to  125 million  The framework has been out there for a few months  It kind of sounds like you re confident  Why the increased sort of litigation expense now  hopefully  will widen this down  Could you maybe give us an update on the tight    on the timeline of maybe what we should be expecting from here Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks for the question  We are still dedicated to the framework  and progress does continue  So that s a positive  But as you can imagine  these are incredibly complicated arrangements we have to work through with 50 different states that we re working with  And so  to get this over the goal line  there s a lot of work that s going to be done over the next several weeks and months to get that done  And even when it s agreed to  it s got to get papered and then we ve got to work through implementation of the various components of it  And so  when you begin to look at all of those costs and the way the spend we believe will ramp up  we believe that you re right  the costs are going to go from  85 million with our original to     100 million to  125 million with a significant portion ramping up in Q3 and even probably a little more in Q4  Next question  please OperatorAnd we ll go to our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks for the questions  Yeah  I guess just to stick with that topic  Mike  because obviously it s so important to Cardinal and to the Group  One of your peers talked about narrowing conversations around a potential opioid settlement  You obviously sound incrementally more positive that this is progressing  Could you maybe just give a little bit more on how many other states    maybe not specifically  but are more states and local governments and municipalities engaging at this point  I think the original framework that we had all seen obviously highlighted just four state AGs  I m just curious  specifically are you seeing more people coming to the other side of the table Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks again for the question on this important topic  As I said  we remain committed to this framework  and we re very appreciative of the four AGs that took the initial lead on this  They have been working with all 50 states  We continue to get the feedback from those states and look to the various components of the details of the agreement  but it wouldn t be appropriate for me right now to try to tell you or handicap how many states are in or out  but I will tell you that the four AGs that we talked to continue to make progress  And I think we all believe that this is the right thing to do for the companies and for the country to help get some relief to the people that need it with not only the dollars we re talking about  which are important  but equally the other components  which are distributing the free goods and working with them on programs to improve the overall monitoring of the opioids Robert Jones    Goldman Sachs    AnalystI appreciate that  Mike  And I guess just to go back to this generic program dynamic  you highlighted first time in several quarters  it went from a headwind to a tailwind  You guys talked specifically about four components that I guess comprise your generic program  Could you maybe just dive a little deeper into what exactly changed to flip the generics from a headwind to a tailwind in the quarter Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think a couple of things  I think first of all  by far  this is the item that drove the difference in our expectations for the quarter  as Dave mentioned  Pretty much everything else was right there where we expected it to be  maybe a little bit better  but this was the big driver  And it s really good performance across all of the components  We re very happy with Red Oak  They continue to perform at a very high level  not only in getting after cost for us  but also just doing an excellent job on service level We really believe we have industry leading service levels  and that really helps lead to maintaining and growing our volumes  which is an important part of it  So while volumes were a little lighter than we had expected originally this year  due to the situation as we mentioned with Fred s that went bankrupt and some other customers that are winding down a few stores  we are still seeing volume growth  And then the other big factor is going to be just market dynamics  We ve seen significant improvement in the overall market dynamics on the pricing side  So when you put all of the components together and we had a strong quarter on launches  it was really strength across all of the components that made the program overperform David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Just  hey  Mike  you hit up in there  I think we did have an earlier than expected launch in some new items  That was helpful for the quarter  In addition  we had a fairly favorable mix that helped drive the results we saw in the second quarter Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorWe ll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYeah  hi  good morning  and congrats on a very good quarter  Mike  going back to your comments on market dynamics and just improved on pricing  digging a little bit deeper into that  when we think about pricing  are you seeing improved pricing on the sell side versus the buy side  And focusing on the buy side  China is an important source of generic API supply  Given what we re seeing there with the coronavirus  how does that impact supply  overall global supply in the marketplace  and what could be the potential implications on potential return to generic inflation  and is any of that in your second half outlook Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll start with as far as the second half outlook goes  we basically are just taking the trends that we ve seen for the first half of the year around generics  The overall programs in kind of forecasting those out for the rest of the year  we re not projecting necessarily any improvements or inflation or anything like that  It s just really about being more confident that what we re seeing  Now that we have roughly eight months of activity versus five  last quarter  which has fell a little too early  to call it  we feel like we ve had enough activity here that we feel good about increasing our guidance related to that  That is clearly the biggest item As far as some color on it  I think the important thing is  it s hard to really get focused on just the buy side or just the sell side because they work in tandem  and it s really about driving margin per unit  and what we re seeing is a much better balance between what s happening on the sell side in terms of the amount of inflation being less than historical  but also being able to balance any decreases there with good performance at Red Oak  so that we can continue to manage our margin per unit in a way to be able to have the overall program grow  And as Dave said  the units and the overall launch has helped for that too  And so  that s really how we look at it As far as the China API  you can imagine  this is something that we monitor  Red Oak is in charge of that for us  and they do a great job of understanding where raw materials are coming from  where they re manufactured  And you re right  there are a decent amount of API manufacture over in China  In some of the affected areas  we have    where we have  we ve worked with manufacturers to try to increase supplies ahead of this  I do think it s something that based on the amount of supply in the supply chain is something the industry should be able to work through  but it s hard to say how long this will last  and it s something that we re going to have to keep an eye on and we will Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorWe ll go to our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan Lisa Gill    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  thanks very much  Good morning  Mike  you called out specialty as being a growth area again in the quarter  Can you just remind us the size of that business and the capabilities versus some of your peers  And then as we think about the potential for IPI  Phonetic  and potential changes around reimbursement  can you talk about your thoughts on that and any impact that you could see in your Specialty business Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  thanks for the question  Our Specialty business  the last number that we publicly gave for FY  19 is that we finished around  19 billion in sales  And so  that s what that business is  We continue to expect that business to have significant growth this year across all of its areas  It s sales into the actual downstream providers in the acute space as well as upstream services to manufacturers  So we are seeing good momentum across all three areas in that business and continue to feel good about not only their quality of service to the customers with some of the investments we re making in the businesses that we ll be able to talk about more here in the future  including a recent investment we ve made in the  Indecipherable  that was announced that we believe will also be an area of helping in the cell and gene area  So we continue to be excited about the specialty area As far as it relates to IPI  I would say this  first of all  we re in favor of anything that can help reduce the cost of healthcare to the US healthcare system  We know that s important  We hope and look to folks to be able to find ways to reduce costs for folks  So that s important to us  The second thing I would say is that when you think about IPI or any of these programs as folks are looking at  the impact to us  I think  is generally where it could impact us in the first order is  does it change list prices  does it mean that the way that manufacturers establish list prices  do they have to lower them  do they have to reduce their price increases  Those are the types of first order of kind of magnitude impact us that we look at And as you and others have heard me say  I think that we as a company and as an industry have really worked well over the years in the fee for service model to first of all  make anything that s    the part that s dependent on deflate or inflation to be less than 5  of our overall margin rate  so that helps protect us from any impact or what folks might do with inflation rates  And secondly  the way we ve been able to demonstrate our ability to renegotiate DSAs over time as WAC prices fluctuate that we still feel very confident that any impact to list prices that we can manage through very effectively as a company and as an industry  The piece that s really important to us though is the impact to our customers  We really look at any of this legislation with the true lens to our customers and the impact on them  and we want to make sure and have commented on past legislation that s been out there that we have to be really careful that type of legislation doesn t reduce access or reduce the ability of our customers and theirselves to be able to work with the actual patients to provide the type of care that we know that they deserve Lisa Gill    JP Morgan    AnalystThank you Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Lisa OperatorAnd we ll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank George Hill    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHey  Good morning  guys  Thanks for taking the question  I guess  Mike and Dave  I d ask you guys a little bit more about the generics program contribution in the quarter  And I guess  what I m looking at is  you guys and your friends in Texas kind of highlighted big beat    you demonstrated big beats in earnings this quarter that were generics related  don t seem repeatable either in the next quarter and the balance of your fiscal years  So maybe could you provide a little bit more color on the earlier than expected launch of the new items that was highlighted and maybe the contribution in the quarter and maybe some more commentary around what was delivered in the quarter that might seem more one time versus what might seem repeatable on a go forward basis  I know that s a lot  Thanks David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  George  Let me answer that  Look  when we talk about the four elements of what we described as generic dynamic  those are a continuation of trends that we d expect to see in Q3 and in Q4  So  we d expect to see year over year some healthy improvement in Q3  Q4  we don t expect to see the same year over year improvement because Q4 of last year  if you go back and look at that  was a quarter and it was the first quarter where we began to see the inflection in this deflationary trend  And so  we have a much more challenging comp in Q4 With respect to the accelerated launch of new items  that s not necessarily a one time or is just a pull forward of something that was anticipated later in the year  So I think you can expect  which is why we call our guidance up specific to Pharma  We expect to see some positive results in Q3 and then possibly today based on what we see somewhat moderation in the year over year comparison in Q4  Does that help answer your question  George George Hill    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  I think you covered it clearly  Thank you Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorWe ll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI Elizabeth Anderson    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  good morning  guys  I was hoping if you could talk a little bit more about some of the Specialty profit drivers in the quarter and maybe more broadly beyond that  Is it sort of an increase in services  this is in the launch calendar  any additional color you could provide on that  that would be helpful Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerI think in Specialty  a lot of this just has to do with the normal growth of Specialty  We are continuing to see certain drugs grow in the marketplace because of their success  particularly in the oncology space  getting new indications and just normal growth  That s a really big piece of it  Part of it is some of the uptake of some of the biosimilars here and there  some of that  While they don t provide a lot more value than normal branded items and they generally act like that  there is some smaller opportunities on the earnings side to earn a slightly better there  That s been a piece of it  We ve seen really nice growth in our services business upstream with wins in our 3PL business in our hub  and some of our other businesses have continued to grow  So nothing unique about like large pieces of movement  a business or anything  one timers like that  It s just nice solid growth with volumes across the board Elizabeth Anderson    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerNext question OperatorWe ll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research Stephen Baxter    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  thanks for the question  So based on your size  the relative components of the Pharma guidance come into the year  it seemed like renewals are driving at least half of the high single digit to low double digit profit decline you re assuming  I assume the renewal impact hasn t changed  So the revised guidance for the low single digit percent decline would seem to indicate a decent amount of underlying growth  excluding the renewals and opioid expenses  which has now moved higher too  So I was wanted to check and see whether you agree with that logic or anything has changed about the sizing of the renewals throughout the year and therefore  whether we should be expecting segment profit to return to growth on a reported basis as we move into next year  Thanks David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerStephen  this Dave  So I d say your assumptions are all pretty spot on  I would say though that we re really    per usual practice  we are not in a position to comment on  21 at this early date  but overall  I think you ve got a good hand on  And I can understand what we ve been articulating Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorWe ll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse Erin Wilson Wright    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thanks  Does your guidance assume any meaningful contribution from biosimilars  Do you continue to view that as sort of an opportunity for you longer term Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Our guidance would assume any of the normal type related stuff  but there is nothing new    no new launches of that created the increase related to biosimilars  We continue to think that something that we ll keep an eye on  I don t believe it will be a big driver for us in the short term because right now  they act more like branded drugs and their overall margin rates are similar  There is a little bit of opportunity to make a little bit more money on some of the biosimilars depending on programs we might be able to put in place with customers  but I would not call them a large driver of anything over the    over this year or over the short term  but something we ll keep our eye on is something to be more of a mid term or longer term driver  particularly if they become interchangeable and then I think  for sure  in my opinion  would change on their ability to be a much bigger driver for us Erin Wilson Wright    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  great  And then where are you in terms of the streamlining of your commercial and supply chain initiatives on the Medical side of the business  You suggested that maybe you face a little bit of a setback here in terms of the recent recalls  but would you say you re still seeing some progress and focus on that front  And also if you could break out the recent Cordis trends specifically  that would be helpful  Thanks Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  On Cordis  I ll just handle that real quick  nothing really to report on Cordis outside of what our expectations are  The business is continuing to grow  We re seeing growth in our profit there  And we continue to be really happy with what the team is doing there to meet or slightly exceed the expectations that we have for that business this year  We don t see it being a driver outside of what we expected for the year one way or the other As far as the initiatives in Medical  we remain incredibly committed to both of them  There is nothing about the underlying strategies of our commercial realignment or our supply chain initiatives that at this time  I would say  make me feel any differently than we have been talking about  But as I noted  particularly well    both of them  but probably a little bit even more in the commercial side  it has been slowed with the gowns recall  We have deployed some of our sales reps as other    as well as other people into the field to be actually located at the hospital locations helping them manage through this challenge that is out there  and it s really important to us that we take care of our customers and our patients  So because of that  it would slow down where we expect to be So we have said and committed that on our supply chain  we would be    have a plan done by the end of Q2  That plan was done  But as we look at implementation of that plan  we re taking into account this disruption that we re working on and just overall reevaluating and make sure we look at the overall global supply chain to make sure there s no changes we would make based on some of the recent challenges  And then again on the commercial piece  we re on track to get the jobs hired and all that  but we do have folks deployed to customers Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question please OperatorWe ll go next to Michael Cherny with BoA Securities Michael Cherny    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGood morning  and thanks for all the details so far  So as you think about the opportunities that you have  you ve highlighted Specialty as a growth opportunity  Obviously  you re performing well so far in areas of Medical  How do you think about that against the backdrop of capital deployment  How do you think about areas where you think your customers are asking for you to do more  And as you    versus previous capital deployment and M A opportunities  are there any other components or pieces of the business that you think is  makes sense to beef up right now Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we    as I mentioned  we still feel really good about having several very    areas that we would consider strategic growth areas  I would highlight four of them  Specialty being one of them  at Home  we ve talked about our connected care services business in Pharma and our Medical Services businesses  These are all businesses we re seeing significant growth on the top line and on the bottom line  And there are also businesses that are really right on trend care moving toward the home and the various things that go along with Specialty and the Service businesses  So these are areas where we are prioritizing our capital expenditures to those areas  so we can really focus on organic growth And if there are M A opportunities out there that would make sense  those would be the areas that you would see us focus on  Now that being said  we re going to continue to do all the right things in our core businesses to make sure we maintain and grow those  but for what I would say extra allocation of capital  those are going to be key areas that we re going to focus our capital expenditures on David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Michael  if I can add  so really  I d say we re focusing as well on partnerships in a way that probably more so than we have in the past  And when we do think about our internal capital  we re really thinking about it in four different categories  We ve got our maintenance capital  We re clearly    you ve heard initiatives like our supply chain  we are focusing on deploying capital to cost out  type projects  We re providing capital in areas where we need capacity for growth  but then we are also deploying some capital to explore new growth areas  So it s a pretty balanced approach  disciplined approach to getting a return on our capex Michael Cherny    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  thanks Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Michael  Next question OperatorWe will go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays Steven Valiquette    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Thanks and good morning everyone  So just a follow up a little bit on Specialty  Two things I want to just    done real quick first  I was a little bit surprised about biosimilars because actually they had been a bunch of biosimilars  Technical Issues  channel  but that was not only the driver  Technical Issues  just changes the price experience with either customers or suppliers and that separating Specialty pricing from traditional brand pricing  whether that may have played a role in some of the better Pharma Distribution segment results  Thanks Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  I think I picked them up  There was a little spotty on being able to hear  But I think I got all your pieces  So let me see if I can walk through them all  From a changing price standpoint  look at it  we ve been very disciplined over several years in our Pharma Distribution business to make sure that we re splitting out our pricing on our Specialty  so that it is priced differently than normal brand  so that we don t    so we can make a fair return on the specialty drugs  And we continue that discipline with any new business or renewals with either    as I ve said before  specific pricing in that area to maintain appropriate profitability or some types of    mix type of penalties and agreements to make sure that if the mix goes the wrong way  that the overall cost of goods adjust  So we continue to be very focused on that in the PD area  And also in the overall Specialty business  since there is very little generics in that space  that is priced on a more individual drug standpoint  And again  we remain very disciplined in that area to be careful  So I wouldn t say that pricing changes is either    is a driver of our growth in Specialty  but it s also not something that we re ignoring or I would say is a headwind from that standpoint As far as growth in Specialty  overall I would say  it really comes from market growth  The market itself is growing significantly with new indications  new drug launches that your question on biosimilars  the thing about the biosimilars  the way to think about it is when the biosimilar launches  you re either    you re not necessarily getting new volume to speak up because of either you re replacing of current branded drug with the biosimilar  So overall  your volume doesn t generally go up because of a biosimilar  It s just an opportunity to potentially be able to have some market movement capabilities to have customers prefer one over the other  and those are where we can make a little bit of extra dollars when we work with our downstream customers to prefer either the brand or the biosimilar  but from an overall perspective drivers  at this point in time  I would not say that is a significant driver  but I think over time  will get to be a more and more potential driver for Specialty  Next question please OperatorWe ll go to our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company James Auh    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystHey  it s James on for Charles  Can you give us a quick update on the cost savings program  maybe how much of the one third  Phonetic  of incremental savings expected this year has been achieved  Is it tracking in line with expectations  And perhaps how much of that s been reinvested opposed to dropping to the bottom line David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  James  Thanks for the question  We re making great progress against that program  and we re still on track to achieve the  500 million target as previously communicated  And also  say  we re on track to realize the  130 million or more this fiscal year  So we re making good progress  We ve got pipeline  As you can imagine  we re tracking all sorts of opportunities and working through kind of stages and maturation  and we re seeing with strong confidence now our ability to obtain the entire  500 million  So we re really continuing to focus more on not just simply cost out  but how do we try to drive improved value  speed throughout the organization  increase our capabilities with the belief that will continue to drive more savings throughout the future With respect to the level of reinvestment  we are continually encouraging our organization to press Mike and I with lots of difficult choices and challenges to reinvest this with high returning projects  I can t quantify for you the exact amount of that  but we re encouraged that we are seeing more and more opportunities as we build this culture within the organization of encouraging people to seek out new opportunities for ongoing cost improvements  growth drivers  etc   etc  So I think the program is one that we should deem as a real success James Auh    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystOkay  And just another technical question  In the share count guidance  does that include any additional share repo beyond the  350 million from the ASR David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerNo  James  that assumes    that we completed  350 million  and there have be no further purchases for this fiscal year contemplated in that guidance James Auh    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you Kevin Moran    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks for the question  Next question please OperatorOur next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystThank you  I d like to return to the Medical recall  I recognize  you re still working through the potential impact going forward  But could you provide us some context for how surgical gowns and kits fit into Medical broadly  maybe starting with market share where your customers are turning an impact on other elements of the business Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we won t  obviously  be able to give a lot of detail on market share  but I can give you a little color is that there    the reason why this is such a    has a large impact is that a lot of surgeries in the US use kits  There is several different folks that compete in that space  but we do compete very effectively  We think with market leading type of quality and services tied to those kits  the ability to design and price those kits appropriately  etc   so that the idea here is that a lot of surgeries in the US do use kits  and because gowns or in almost every kit  even though when you look at this as an overall relatively small percentage of gowns sold across the US because they are in kits  that s why it s having a more    a larger impact than you might expect  And so  I ll just stop there and see what your follow up question is might beyond on that just to make sure I m hitting the right things for you Eric Percher    Nephron Research    AnalystSo I think concerns from the hospital purchasers around impact on utilization and impacts on their business  you started with an apology taking that head on  but what is your take on the ability to remedy this and any impact on the business from what this has done to relationships here Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think anytime you have a challenge in any business  it s often the way you respond  that makes a difference  And I couldn t be more impressed with how our Medical team from the leaders  Steve  all the way down to people in the distribution centers have responded taken accountability and ownership for this and said we re going to do everything we can to make the customer s life is good as we can knowing the circumstances  So we have deployed hundreds of people  We ve taken out not only our Medical segment  but the Pharma team and corporate functions have also volunteered and sent people even to the Vice President level out to the field to pack kits  pull things together for customers at their locations to make    to do the best we can  And so  I m    I believe that the way we re responding to this is really  really important And I think that our feedback so far from the majority of customers is they understand things like this can happen  but they respect and appreciate the way we re responding  It s hard to say how this ultimately as Dave said  we don t know how this could affect our business going forward  and we re hoping that it doesn t  But we know that we have created some pain and the most important thing to us is our customers know that we are focused on them first and foremost  so that they can treat the patients that they take care of that  We re also taking a lot of other specific actions too  It s not only deploying people into the field to make things better  but it is also about increasing production of similar or replacement products  for instance  we re offering our more protective Level 4 gowns to help bridge the supply gap  We ve ramped up production  because we do source this    these gowns in multiple locations And so  we re ramping up sourcing elsewhere  We re working with the folks that make similar products  both brand and I d say  private label products to ramp those up to get them going  so we have those that go in through with surgeries  So it s really important that we look at all of these actions to make sure that we re keeping surgeries going and keeping our customers that pay from our customers as small as possible  Next question please OperatorWe ll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS Kevin Caliendo    UBS Equities    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  I just want to go back to the opioid comment  You said    I think you called out that it could take months    weeks or months to get this done  and that would run into two pretty high profile state trials that are scheduled  How does this increase in spending does have anything to do with maybe a longer timeline or how should we think about those two state trials coming up in terms of the context of your expected spend now versus what it was before Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Clearly  if those trials do happen  our spending goes up  which is why we gave a range  We re not trying to indicate that they will  or they won t  We just know they re out there  We intend to vigorously defend ourselves  We feel really good that we are  and we ll be prepared for those trials that happen  We re not going to use those trials or have those trials  cause us panic and do something that doesn t make sense  And so  we re going to continue to work with the four AGs and the rest of the states to get this initial framework done  It s still our goal  but I wouldn t look at the increased spending around  particularly related to the trials  Again there is a range  but it s more around finishing up the negotiations  and then you got to go through a documentation process like actually papering it and that takes    will take some significant lawyer time to get things papered and work through all those details  So I think it s more things like those and then an implementation process working through the    how would we distribute the free goods  what changes can we make in the overall monitoring systems  There s a lot of work to be done that will take legal costs  And so  we continue to be focused on    and that s why we put that range out Kevin Caliendo    UBS Equities    AnalystIf I can ask one really quick follow up on the API issue  I think Ricky brought it up earlier  You said that you thought there was enough supply in the chain to manage it  Can you quantify like how much is actually in the supply chain in terms of product  If China were to be a six week issue or an eight week issue  would that still be    would you just still feel comfortable with that Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s a great question  I can t really give you that level of detail  I don t really know where our competitors are  I know that this is something that we ve looked at specifically product by product  looked at products that we think have a more potential risk of supply challenges because of where the raw materials at and the importance of those products to the healthcare system  And we have been working to ramp up supply in a few of those to carry a little bit extra  So for right now from what we see  we are not anticipating any problems  but if the shutdowns in China were to go longer or it spreads and creates other challenges  it s just hard to know at this point in time  but we think we re managing it to the best of our abilities at this point in time Kevin Caliendo    UBS Equities    AnalystThat s really helpful  Thanks so much OperatorAnd we ll go to our last    we will take our last question from Eric Coldwell with Baird Eric Coldwell    Robert W  Baird   Company    AnalystHey  thanks  Good morning  So in MedSurg distribution  you cited that is both a headwind for revenue and profit  I guess  I m a little bit surprised  We ve seen both inpatient and emergency department volumes increasing here for the last  call it  give or take  two  three  four quarters  and it s not only increasing    accelerating the increase at least according to some internal data and external data we have  We also had an early flu season  So what s going on in MedSurg    core MedSurg distribution in the US  and what are the challenges that you re seeing now Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerI think    I ll start here  And then if there s anything to add  Dave can do that  I would say this  First of all  we re not seeing necessarily anything that would say that the actual MedSurg historical volumes of very low single digit type of growth has changed significantly out there  So it s hard for me to comment on what you re seeing  But we haven t seen anything  I would say  dramatic in that spot  Remember last year  we have a lot of lumpiness in our first couple of quarters related to the TSAs  And so  some of our compare is we think caused by the fact that we re comparing to last year as we were going off those TSAs  And so  if you look at our first half  we re roughly up 2   which seems more in line  And so  I think we really need to get another quarter or two behind us to understand overall  And again  with this kit recall and gown recall  there is a few challenges there we re still trying to work through  but there is nothing  I would say  big going on  And from all the work we ve done by talking to our customers and to our reps  we still feel really confident about what we re doing in our commercial restructuring that over the mid to long term  that s going to be a large value creator for us  but we ve got to get through these challenges for that to happen Kevin Caliendo    UBS Equities    AnalystRight  And I just    I know the kit recall really didn t pop up until January  So I was clearly talking more about the last couple of quarters  it just   Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerRight  Absolutely Kevin Caliendo    UBS Equities    AnalystI guess maybe the TSAs is an issue  we need to go back and revisit  but we can take this up on offline David C  Evans    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Eric  I would just    I would reiterate a little bit what Mike said  which is I wouldn t read too much into single quarter of Q2 because of all the transition is going on last year  I m really looking at our first half and saying  how is the first half compared to our expectations  And the first half is really    it s very much in line with our expectations Mike Kaufmann    Chief Executive OfficerThanks again for the question  All right  so let me close  I d like to close by saying  we remain focused on our customers and their patients  And we will continue to deliver on our strategic priorities  Thanks for your questions and your time today  And we look forward to speaking with each of you soon  Take care Operator Operator Closing Remarks

Shares of Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  gained over 11  today after the healthcare company reported solid fiscal second quarter 2020 operating results and raised its fiscal full year 2020 guidance  
The business reported quarterly revenue growth of 5  compared to the year ago period  Cardinal Health received a significant earnings boost from its generic pharmaceuticals portfolio  which is surprising considering generic drugs have presented challenges to many companies across the industry due to increased competition  lower selling prices  and mounting legal issues  
As of 1 12 p m  EST  the pharma stock had settled to a 12 1  gain 

So what
Cardinal Health reports two segments  pharmaceutical and medical  In the fiscal second quarter of 2020  the pharmaceutical business generated revenue of  35 7 billion and income of  462 million  while the medical segment reported revenue of  4 billion and income of  195 million  
The company reported total revenue of  39 7 billion and adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 52  Both quarterly totals beat Wall Street s expectations for  39 4 billion in sales and  1 22 in adjusted EPS  according to numbers compiled by Yahoo  Finance  
While Cardinal Health reported a 34  decrease in quarterly operating income compared to the year ago period  investors didn t seem to mind  Instead  they seem pleased that management raised fiscal full year 2020 guidance for adjusted EPS to a midpoint of  5 30  up from a previous midpoint of  4 97  
Now what
Shares of Cardinal Health have surged in recent months since bottoming out in late 2019  Although there s plenty of ground to make up before the stock can threaten its 10 year peak of about  90 per share  investors are cautiously optimistic that the business is heading in the right direction ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps371,2078313

145096,366611,CAH,Cardinal  CAH  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cardinal basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cardinal  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cardinal
For the fiscal year ending June      2020  this prescription drug distributor is expected to earn  5 05 per share  which is a change of  4 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cardinal  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Cardinal to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cardinal-cah-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200498032,200498032
145097,366612,CAH,Earnings Preview  Cardinal Health  CAH  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 21 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 2  
Revenues are expected to be  39 48 billion  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 38  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cardinal 
For Cardinal  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  5 19  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cardinal will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cardinal would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 27  delivering a surprise of  16 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cardinal doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-cardinal-health-cah-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200503288,200503288

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 25 62   A quarter ago  it was expected that this prescription drug distributor would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 27  delivering a surprise of 16 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times

145100,366615,CAH,Cardinal  CAH  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  59 8 in the previous session  Cardinal Health has gained 15 2  since the start of the year compared to the 3 3  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 3 4  return for the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 6  2020  Cardinal reported EPS of  1 52 versus consensus estimate of  1 21 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 64  
For the current fiscal year  Cardinal is expected to post earnings of  5 09 per share on  152 67 billion in revenues  This represents a  3 6  change in EPS on a 4 9  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 34 per share on  159 26 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 81  and 4 32   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Cardinal may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cardinal has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 5X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 6 7X versus its peer group s average of 12 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 86  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cardinal currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cardinal fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Cardinal shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2020-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cardinal-cah-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200505716,200505716

Carrying lower than average price to earnings and price to book ratios  value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates  While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long term performance  growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets 
Costs

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 80   making it one of the most expensive products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 2 65  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

145123,366638,CAH,Cardinal  CAH  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cardinal is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Cardinal  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Cardinal
This prescription drug distributor is expected to earn  5 05 per share for the fiscal year ending June      2020  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cardinal  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

145152,366667,CAH,Cardinal Health  CAH  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 5  
Revenues are expected to be  36 98 billion  up 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cardinal 
For Cardinal  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cardinal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cardinal would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 11  delivering a surprise of  19 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cardinal appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cardinal-health-cah-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200480857,200480857

145166,366681,CAH,Trump drug pricing speech adds dose of uncertainty for healthcare investors,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are bracing for widespread volatility in healthcare stocks on Friday  when U S  President Donald Trump is expected to give a highly anticipated speech about controlling prescription drug prices  The S P 500 healthcare sector has declined about 1 percent in 2018  underperforming the broader S P 500 by more than two percentage points  Investors say concerns about drug pricing regulations have contributed to pressure on group   Trump s speech  delayed from earlier in the year  has injected added anxiety  He has addressed the issue of lowering prices in the past  saying as president elect in January 2017  for example  that drugmakers were  getting away with murder  in what they charge the government for medicines   Investors don t like uncertainty and this speech has created a fair amount of uncertainty   said Les Funtleyder  healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management   We don t really know what is necessarily priced in  what level of detriment to all these industries is priced in   Healthcare policy speeches by senior government officials in recent weeks also may have changed the thinking of investors   The sense is that the proposals could go a little further than what we have seen in the budget and other places   said Ipsita Smolinski  managing director at healthcare research and consulting firm Capitol Street  The speech could affect a broad group of stocks in the healthcare sector  which makes up 13 6 percent of the S P 500   The president never shies away from fiery rhetoric  and we expect that in his speech he will finger manufacturers  pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs   insurers  hospitals  and foreign countries as responsible for high drug costs   Height Capital Markets analyst Andrea Harris said in a note  Harris said she expects  material headline risk  to the stocks but that the administration  will not implement the most material policies that Trump will suggest in the speech in the next two years  if ever   The healthcare sector was rallying on Thursday  up 1 percent in afternoon trading against a 0 7 percent gain by the S P 500  Shares of companies potentially in the cross hairs of Trump s speech were higher  including pharmaceutical wholesaler  Cardinal Health  Inc  NYSE CAH  and drug benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co  Some analysts said on Thursday that investors could be becoming less worried about the speech while others said it was hard to predict what Trump might say  Overall  shares of large pharmaceutical and biotech companies have struggled this year  While companies have endured product or other disappointments  analysts have pointed to concerns about pressures on drug pricing as a cloud over the stocks  By contrast  healthcare sectors seen as immune to such pricing concerns   makers of medical devices and research tools   have outperformed   Friday s speech may provide some clarity for investors  but the prospect of healthcare and drug pricing being a hot topic heading into the mid term U S  congressional elections in November may lead worries about the sector to persist

expectations to their respective portfolio  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation However  the task of designing one s portfolio with potential outperformers is anything but an easy one  The task becomes even more difficult when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance It is often observed that one falters in life owing to lack of proper guidance  This is applicable to the investing world as well  With a plethora of stocks flooding the market at any point of time  it is highly possible for an investor to make a wrong choice while designing one s portfolio  in the absence of proper know how or expertise  Moreover  the time constraint that we all have to confront these days makes the task of making proper choices harder Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns  thereby ruining the very objective of investing one s hard earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market  In a bid to avoid such a scenario  investors usually rely on guidance from proper sources Broker Advice   The Way ForwardIn the field of investing  brokers are deemed to be experts with thorough knowledge  Brokers

for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Winning PointerSince brokers indulge in meticulous research  the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise  The direction of the estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to

to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   Therefore  one must take the top line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning

even more difficult when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance It is often observed that one falters in life owing to lack of proper guidance  This is applicable to the investing world as well  With a plethora of stocks flooding the market at any point of time  it is highly possible for an investor to make a wrong choice while designing one s portfolio  in the absence of proper know how or expertise  Moreover  the time constraint that we all have to confront these days makes the task of making proper choices harder Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns  thereby ruining the very objective of investing one s hard earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market  In a bid to avoid such a scenario  investors usually rely on guidance from proper sources Broker Advice   The Way ForwardIn the field of investing  brokers are deemed to be experts with thorough knowledge  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations   Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Winning PointerSince brokers indulge in meticulous research  the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise  The direction of the estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters  it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason logic behind their improving the recommendation on a particular stock  Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Revenues Performance Not to be IgnoredAccording to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   Therefore  one must take the top line performance into consideration as well while formulating a winning strategy  We have included in our screen the price

145207,366722,CAH,Analysts Estimate Cardinal Health  CAH  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  36 90 billion  up 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 81  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cardinal 
For Cardinal  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cardinal will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cardinal would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 59  delivering a surprise of  11 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cardinal doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-cardinal-health-cah-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200449136,200449136
145208,366723,CAH,Cardinal Health  CAH  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 93 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 01 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19 35   A quarter ago  it was expected that this prescription drug distributor would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 59  delivering a surprise of 11 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Cardinal  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  37 35 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 24   This compares to year ago revenues of  35 35 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Cardinal shares have lost about 4 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15  
What s Next for Cardinal 
While Cardinal has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cardinal was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 17 on  36 94 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 16 on  150 56 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Dental Supplies is currently in the top 42  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cardinal-health-cah-q4-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200452884,200452884
145209,366724,CAH,A Pay Raise Rant Goes Bad and Reveals Angst of American Workers,news," Bloomberg     Donald Trump says his corporate tax cuts are setting off a domino effect that will finally end the long  lean years for American wage earners 
More than a million workers at companies from AT T Inc  NYSE T   to Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   already got their payout  the president said this week  There s more to come  Trump said  because  the ones that didn t get it  everyone is saying   Where s mine   So they re all going to have it   
That would be a big deal for the economy and for markets  Lackluster pay has been a weak point of America s recovery after the Great Recession  helping to keep inflation below the Federal Reserve s target rate  and bond yields at historically low levels 
Some of the top names in fixed income investing are starting to call the end of that decades long rally    citing Trump s tax cuts among the factors  The case gets a boost every time a corporate employer raises pay  and this week the biggest of them all did exactly that  Wal Mart Stores Inc   NYSE WMT  increased starting hourly rates and handed out bonuses  Late Thursday  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  NYSE FCAU  joined the party 
But a tale out of another giant company   Pfizer  Inc   NYSE PFE   illustrates why it may be too early to predict a wage bonanza 
Hours after Trump signed the tax law  Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read wrote to about 100 000 employees and contractors  He hailed a landmark measure that would galvanize American business  Read s memo made no mention of higher salaries or bonuses  though  and the company hasn t announced any such plans 
That didn t sit well with one woman working for the drugmaker as a contractor in Chicago  She didn t exactly ask the Trump question   where s mine    But it was late and she was annoyed by Read s message  so she responded with a salty one of her own  Why  she asked  was the boss sharing his jubilation at all the benefits the company was set to reap    when none of them might trickle down to its workers 
Not only did she not get a raise    she was tossed off the contract 
 Unprofessional Language 
Her  assignment was ended solely because of the use of inappropriate and unprofessional language   Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said  The contractor asked not to be identified by name  saying she didn t want to lose out on future jobs because of the episode 
Pfizer is evaluating how to use its tax gains  on behalf of all stakeholders    Campion said when asked about pay and bonuses   Our compensation is driven by performance  not legislation  and is set at a competitive level   
That s a key part of the case that Trump s tax bill won t be a game changer in labor markets  Corporate profits will rise    but they ve been elevated  by historical standards  for several years already  and workers haven t seen big benefits  Some companies were doubtless planning pay raises anyway  But whatever was a competitive wage before the cuts  in employers  eyes  will remain one afterwards 
 Because I Have To 
Or  as Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker expressed it last week  putting himself in a CEO s shoes   At the end of the day  I m going to raise wages because I have to  not because I want to  
Of course  that could happen  There are plenty of economists  including Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   who do expect broad wage acceleration as companies compete for scarce workers  In the takeoff camp s favor is an unemployment rate that looks poised to drop below 4 percent for the first time since 2000 
There are signs  post tax bill  that  firms are starting to be a little more generous   said Stephen Stanley  chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York 
For those who doubt that 2018 is the year pay will finally pick up  employment is a more important benchmark than unemployment 
The jobless rate may be near the lows it reached at the end of the 1990s boom   but that s partly because many Americans have given up on job seeking  The share of the working age population that s actually in work hasn t recovered to the level it reached before the Great Recession  let alone its 2000 peak    leaving a pool of labor on the sidelines 
Anecdotes also suggest that businesses are turning to non wage compensation  like benefits or flexible work schedules  to avoid increasing base pay 
Cash to Shareholders
Many companies say they ll hand any additional cash from the tax cut not to employees but to shareholders  through dividends and buybacks    or spend it on acquisitions  which often result in job cuts 
 Cardinal Health  Inc  NYSE CAH    the drug distributor  will  look at strategic M A opportunities and we ll return cash to shareholders    Chief Financial Officer George Gomez told investors in San Francisco this week  Pfizer s CFO  Frank D Amelio  was asked in an October call how the company might use extra funds from the tax measures  He listed its capital allocation priorities   dividends  share buybacks  investing in the business  and M A   
That s one reason Democrats and other critics have labeled Trump s tax bill a corporate giveaway  Defenders point out that some of the cash will be used to expand operations and create jobs  while the portion that goes into stock markets benefits the millions of Americans who have retirement funds 
Wait Forever 
There are also millions who don t  And they ve had to struggle through through a bear market for U S  labor that s even older than the bull market for bonds 
There have been bright interludes such as the late  90s boom  but essentially the so called labor share    the chunk of American economic output that goes to workers in the form of wages and salaries    has been in steady decline since the 1970s  Whatever the impact of Trump s tax bill  expecting it to turn such long term trends around would be a bold prediction 
 If you re waiting for a 1970s style breakout in wages or prices    said Stanley  the Amherst Pierpont economist   I don t think you re ever going to see it  ",2018-01-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/a-payraise-rant-goes-bad-and-reveals-angst-of-american-workers-1096508,1096508

145299,366814,CAH,Is Cardinal Health  CAH  A Solid Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cardinal Health   NYSE CAH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cardinal Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 2  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cardinal Health  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 3 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Cardinal Health has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Cardinal Health  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cardinal Health has a P S ratio of just 0 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cardinal Health currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cardinal Health a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cardinal Health is 1 6  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 9  which is way better than the industry average of 17 4  Clearly  CAH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cardinal Health might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of D

recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cardinal Health  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock with a long term EPS growth rate of 6 2  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we

145323,366838,CAH,Cardinal Health  CAH  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 09 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 8  
Revenues are expected to be  36 25 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cardinal 
For Cardinal  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cardinal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cardinal would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 29  delivering a surprise of  21 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line

What s Next for Cardinal 
While Cardinal has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cardinal was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

145338,366853,CAH,Earnings Preview  Cardinal Health  CAH  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  33 54 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 69  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cardinal 
For Cardinal  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 63  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cardinal will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cardinal would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 01  delivering a surprise of  8 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

145341,366856,CAH,Should Value Investors Pick Cardinal Health  CAH  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Cardinal Health  Inc    NYSE CAH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Cardinal Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 16 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Cardinal Health s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should point out that Cardinal Health has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 9 as well  which is in line with the current level  Hence the forward earnings estimates are already incorporated in the company s current share price P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Cardinal Health has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 9 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CAH is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Cardinal Health currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Cardinal Health a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Cardinal Health is 1 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 0  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 3  which is far better than the industry average of 15 6  Clearly  CAH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Cardinal Health might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F  This gives CAH a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current fiscal quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the fiscal full year estimate has seen only one upward and five downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 16 8  in the past two months  while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Cardinal Health  Inc  Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCardinal Health is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 39   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider

145368,366883,CAH,More Trouble On The Horizon For Cardinal Health Stock,opinion,"Cardinal Health Inc  NYSE CAH  will take its turn in the earnings confessional before the open on Monday  Ahead of the event  the pharmaceuticals distributor just flashed a bearish signal which could spell trouble in the near term 
For starters  Cardinal Health s history of post earnings reactions has been less than promising  The security has averaged a 5 2  single session post earnings move over the past eight quarters    where three of the past four have been negative  Following the most recent release in May  CAH stock dropped a whopping 21 4  the day after reporting 
At last check  Cardinal Health stock was up 1 8  to trade at  50 94  The healthcare name has shed 27  year over year  carving out a channel of lower lows thanks to four bear gaps in 2018  The equity is now within a chip shot of its 40 day moving average after spending most of 2018 below the trendline  According to Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  in the 12 most recent times CAH has come within one standard deviation of this trendline after a lengthy stay below it  the security has gone on to average a one month loss of 2 55   with 64  of those returns negative 

Should the drug retailer extend its recent slide  there is ample room aboard the bearish bandwagon  Although short interest increased by 30  in the two most recent reporting periods  the 9 72 million shares sold short represents a meager 3 7  of CAH s total available float  or only 2 8 times the average daily pace of trading 
In the options pits  the attitude leans toward calls  The stock s 10 day call put volume ratio of 1 37 at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  ranks in the 80th percentile of its annual range  This indicates a healthier than usual appetite for long calls over puts in the past two weeks  An unwinding of these bullish bets could push CAH lower 
Traders  whether bullish or bearish  may want to consider Cardinal Health options  since it s been a good target for premium buyers during the past year  That s according to its Schaeffer s Volatility Scorecard  SVS  of 78 out of 100  which shows it s tended to make much bigger than expected moves on the charts compared to what the options market was expecting ",2018-08-05,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/more-trouble-on-the-horizon-for-cardinal-health-stock-200336404,200336404

145460,366975,CAH,Medtronic Preliminary Sales Dip Y Y  Hurricane Blow Lessens,opinion,"Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT   announced dull preliminary sales results for second quarter fiscal 2018  Preliminary worldwide revenues for the quarter dipped 4  year over year to  7 05 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 09 billion remains a tad higher than the reported preliminary revenue figure 
Per Medtronic  the year over year decline in the preliminary sales performance was driven by the company s divestiture of its Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis  Compression  and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  that occurred at the beginning of the quarter 
On a comparable  constant currency basis  adjusting for the divestiture and a positive impact of  35 million from foreign currency   the company s second quarter preliminary revenues increased 3  year over year  The company also noted that excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria  second quarter revenue growth would have been 4  on a comparable  constant currency basis Medtronic PLC Price

   Also  per the preliminary report  the impact from Maria was approximately  55  65 million on the company s second quarter top line  Besides  the hurricane left an adverse impact of roughly 3 cents on its second quarter non GAAP earnings per share  EPS  
Excluding the effect of Maria  Medtronic reaffirmed its fiscal second quarter guidance The company expects adjusted EPS to be flat to slightly up on a comparable  constant currency basis from  1 04 in the year ago quarter  It also expects a favorable impact of a penny from foreign currency translation on the quarter s adjusted EPS 
Despite the year over year drag in preliminary sales  it is encouraging to note that the latest projection is actually an improvement from the company s earlier anticipationabout the financial impact of Maria which was provided a month back  That time  Medtronic had projected both fiscal second quarter 2018 revenues and adjusted net earnings to the extent of  250 million 
More specifically  the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group and the Restorative Therapies Group were expected to be worst hit  Notably  Medtronic is slated to release its second quarter fiscal 2018 results on November 21 before the market opens

Safe from Graham Cassidy Repeal BillOver the past few months  the medical device space has been witnessing considerable upheaval owing to a confluence of factors  This has affected the fortunes of MedTech majors like Cardinal Health Inc  NYSE      and Penumbra Inc  NYSE      The investment climate for medical device majors has become increasingly volatile due to political potshots in Capitol Hill  for and against Obamacare  This is due to the fact that the GOP is making one final push on an Affordable Care Act repeal bill  The legislation  commonly referred to as Graham Cassidy  aims to convert the Medicaid and premium subsidy dollars into a block grant structure giving freedom of spending to states Past fortnight has witnessed extensive lobbying for and against the Graham Cassidy bill by legislators to garner for and against the required 50 votes at the Senate  The trend is expected to continue till September 30  Earlier  Obamacare assured coverage to people with pre existing ailments and restricted insurers from charging them based on health conditions The Senate Bill  however  will allow insurers to provide less than required coverage in states that get waivers for essential health benefits  However  the changes would not take effect until 2020 but would slash Medicaid budgets to the tune of almost 25  by 2026 How Is MedTech Positioned Though the space remains volatile  there are many stocks in the MedTech domain that promise growth  The question now arises that how to pick  safe stocks from the various industries of the MedTech space  in such a scenario  Within the Zacks Industry classification  it is broadly grouped into the  sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and further sub divided into important areas like Medical   Instruments  Medical   Products

the S P 500 by shedding 0 25  over the past month  The index  on the other hand  has gained 1 94   By applying Zacks wisdom in this space  we are bullish on STAAR Surgical Company  Nasdaq

145485,367000,CAH,Medtronic Starts PRODIGY Study On Respiratory Compromise ,opinion,"Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT    a medical device major is successfully continuing with innovation and product development strategy  The company recently introduced a new global study on opioid induced respiratory depression  OIRD   a preventable form of respiratory compromise 
Named PRODIGY  PRediction of Opioid induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY   this is a prospective  multi center  post market  international cohort study  Based on 1650 patients  this trial aims at detecting patients with high risk of respiratory compromise 
Per Medtronic s claim  this is the first study to use pulse oximetry and capnography in patients undergoing opioid medication  The research may enable patients to access clinical and economic benefits  The study also aims at helping physicians to better understand the true incidence of respiratory compromise that has been ignored otherwise 
Significantly   respiratory compromise  can be life threatening  Its progressive condition may negatively impact breathing abilities of a person  OIRD patients after their opioid administration  particularly experience a loss in effective ventilatory function  
Growth Prospects
We believe that post completion  this PRODIGY study will prove to be a major breakthrough for Medtronic s patient monitoring and recovery segment within its Minimally Invasive Therapies Group  MITG  as company data shows that respiratory compromise condition is rapidly ranking third on the list of costliest hospital inpatient expenses in the U S 
Latest information provided by Technavio also ratifies the rapid growth of a niche market for respiratory compromise  It reflects that global capnography market has been forecast to witness a CAGR of over 16  during 2016 2020  An Infoholic research report also reveals huge growth potential of the broader Global Respiratory Care Devices Market  which is tipped to observe an estimated CAGR of 8 8  over the forecast period of 2017 2023  Thus  Medtronic is expected to reap benefits  if it can successfully run the PRODIGY study 
Recent Developments
With an aim to focus more on its core business within the company s patient monitoring and recovery segment  the company has decided to divest a part of the business  Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency  to Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  
The divestment of these non core  non profitable wings will help Medtronic to invest over long term  high return  internal and external opportunities that are more directly aligned with the company s growth strategies of therapy innovation  globalization and economic value 
Post closing  the company conveys that the transaction is expected to result in an immediate positive impact on Medtronic s comparable  constant currency revenue growth rate and the adjusted comparable  constant currency operating margin of approximately 50 basis points each 
Notably  Patient Monitoring   Recovery have already registered above market growth during the company s last reported fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings announced last week  which was driven by strong products like PB980 ventilator  Capnostream 20 bedside capnography monitor  capnography disposables and Nellcor pulse oximetry products

145525,367040,CAH,Stock Exchange  The Experts Like Energy,opinion,"Technical experts are a rich source of new stock ideas  Our models  Felix  Oscar  and Holmes each specialize in a different time frame and level of risk  Before their weekly poker game  they spend a few minutes trading ideas  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange   Here is the cast of characters 
Felix is fussy  precise  and very cautious  He looks for what is working  but it also must have upside potential  He is an investor who thinks long term  Felix will not usually announce new picks  but he will answer questions  saying what he thinks about specific stocks 
Oscar is naturally optimistic and a bit excitable  He definitely likes to go with winners  and focuses on a one month time frame  He trades either sector ETFs  or a basket of stocks  equally weighted  that reflect a sector  Oscar will mention a favorite sector each week  and will also answer questions about sectors 
Holmes is a trader  but a cautious one  Holmes emphasizes asset protection through profit taking  stops  and trailing stops  He is careful in selecting new positions  and generally looks at an intermediate time frame  There is no set holding period  but two or three months is not unusual  Holmes will tell us one stock recommended that week  For those who sign up for his email list  no charge  privacy respected  holmes at newarc dot com  he will report exits with a one day delay 
Jeff sometimes joins the discussion with some comments about stock or market fundamentals 
This Week s Ideas 
My purpose is to show how different approaches   all sound methods   often lead to different conclusions  Technical versus fundamental  trader versus investor  short term versus long term   all make a difference  I hope you will find the weekly discussion interesting and become a part of it 
Each member of the group  independently  comes up with an idea  To my surprise this week was all about energy 
Felix 
I am liking oil and gas this week  I particularly like SM Energy  NYSE SM   There is a lot of movement and great long term opportunity for more growth 

Oscar 
I m still holding onto Regional Banks  but my latest sector pick is Refiners  Just a glance at this YTD chart for VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners  NYSE CRAK  and you ll see a strong element of seasonality in this sector  I don t think we re anywhere near this year s peak just yet 

Most stocks in this area have been quietly jogging through this low volatility period  waiting to break out into a sprint  I know I ll be watching when they cross the finish line  Will you 
Holmes 
I do not talk as much as Felix and Oscar  but my stock picks are still ahead of the humans  Last week s bumpy ride has not changed my bullish outlook  Here is one I bought this week  Solar City  NASDAQ SCTY  

Jeff 
The aptly named CRAK focuses on the key element for refiners  the   This tracks the difference in price between their input  crude oil  and the refined product they sell  When oil prices fell most people missed the opportunity in refiners  One way to keep an eye on this is to watch the forward curve on   Yes  there is such a thing  The spread declines seasonally into the end of the year  and looks nicely higher net year  Oscar might be disappointed in how long this takes 
Felix seems to think that SM Energy will return to the good old days when it traded 80  Time will tell  In last week s question about AAPL he thought the chart was too messy  but I liked the stock  I would point out who is leading on that question  but it is best not to talk trash around Felix 
Holmes picked Solar City  which is showing some volatility  Holmes is quick to exit trades that are not working 
Questions 
Each week we will answer questions  Feel free to address any of us 
One reader noted insider selling in Cardinal Health Inc  NYSE CAH   This can be an important fundamental factor  more typically when there is buying  Holmes does not consider it because the information is not released quickly enough to be helpful in his time frame 
Another reader suggested that the group needed a female perspective  That is interesting  since there will be a new member of the poker group soon  She is quick thinking and fast trading  She knows a good chart when she sees one 
An Important Note to Readers 
Felix  Oscar  and Holmes are all models  carefully engineered and tested by one of the leading developers of the last thirty years  They are highly modified momentum models  with different time frames and features 
I humanize them because it makes it easier to understand the characteristics in their design  I always remind readers that my posts are informational  not investment advice  but special emphasis is needed here  While we are trading based upon all three models  we are always watching and can act quickly when necessary  The models are not suitable for all investors

145542,367057,CAH,CAH  A Wonderful Healthcare Stock Trading At A Reasonable Price,opinion,"Cardinal Health  N CAH  scores extremely well for Dividend Safety  95  and Dividend Growth  91   The company has increased its dividend by 15  per year over the last five years and shows no signs of slowing down 
With a reasonable earnings multiple of 15 4x  now could be a good time to consider buying Cardinal Health for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewCardinal Health was founded in the 1970s and has grown to become one of the largest healthcare companies in the world with over  100 billion in annual sales  It primarily makes money by distributing a wide variety of pharmaceutical and medical supplies 
The company does business with more than 5 000 pharmaceutical and medical surgical suppliers to serve over 25 000 U S  retail pharmacies and provide products to more than 75  of U S  hospitals  Overall  Cardinal Health sells over 2 5 billion healthcare products each year 
Cardinal Health s Pharmaceutical segment generated 89  of the company s total sales and 83  of its segment profit last fiscal year  This business distributes a wide range of branded and generic drugs  specialty pharmaceuticals  and over the counter products 
The company s Medical segment distributes medical  surgical  and laboratory products to hospitals and other healthcare providers  This business accounted for 11  of Cardinal Health s total sales and 17  of its segment profit last year 
By geography  roughly 95  of Cardinal Health s sales are in the U S   although it also has some meaningful operations in China Business AnalysisAs middlemen  distributors typically generate very little gross profit on each sale they make  For example  Cardinal Health earned a paltry 5 6  gross margin last fiscal year 
These companies depend significantly on generating a high volume of sales to turn a meaningful profit  The best distributors to do business with are ones that offer the broadest range of products with the most reasonable prices and highest quality delivery standards 
As a result  distributors with massive distribution networks  long standing customer contracts  and economies of scale are best positioned to exceed 
In healthcare  cost effective distributors are especially important  Hospitals and pharmacies are under ever increasing amounts of pressure to save money and reduce waste  If they can consolidate the number of distributors they work with  they can achieve greater efficiency and lower costs for their customers 
Cardinal Health s scale and expertise provides it with advantages over smaller companies that allow it to profitably pursue some of the biggest deals in the industry  For example  the company established Red Oak Sourcing  a 10 year generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with CVS Health  N CVS  in July 2014 
Cardinal Health is also somewhat unique in that it manufactures some of its own medical products and operates its own retail pharmacy  providing it with some vertical integration cost benefits  The company is also working to increase its mix of generic drugs  which generally carry higher margins 
To maintain its size and cost advantages  Cardinal Health is constantly acquiring other businesses that expand its breadth of products  customers  and geographies  The industry is also extremely fragmented and under an increasing amount of regulation  which should provide plenty of opportunity for continued growth as consolidation continues Cardinal Health s Key RisksThe U S  healthcare system is undergoing significant changes due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  While a significantly higher number of people will have health insurance coverage  driving more demand for Cardinal Health s products  price pressure will likely intensify 
The healthcare system needs to become more efficient  which means efforts to reduce costs across the board in the form of lower reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical companies  especially for high margin generic drugs  and others  The result could be more pressure on Cardinal Health s margins and growth prospects 
Additionally  some of Cardinal Health s distribution contracts with certain customers are extremely large  CVS Health accounted for 27  of Cardinal Health s revenue last year  and its five biggest customers represented 41  of total sales  The contract with CVS Health runs through 2019 
If the company is unable to renew these contracts or is forced to accept less favorable terms  its business can be significantly impacted  For example  Cardinal Health lost its  22 billion pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens  O WBA  in 2013 and its  9 billion supply contract with Express Scripts  O ESRX  in 2012 
It s also worth mentioning that the profitability of Cardinal Health s Pharmaceutical segments is impacted by its mix of generic and branded drugs  as well as the timing of new drug launches  All of these factors impact the prices received for the products Cardinal Health distributes and can result in tailwinds or headwinds any given year  However  we do not believe this is a risk to the company s long term earnings power Dividend Analysis  Cardinal HealthWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Cardinal Health has a Dividend Safety Score of 95  which indicates that it has one of the safest dividend payments in the market  Over the last 12 months  the company s dividend has consumed 37  of its earnings and 20  of its free cash flow  These are relatively low payout ratios which provide plenty of safety 
Looking further back  we can see that Cardinal Health s payout ratios have increased significantly over the last 10 years but have averaged 20 30  during the last five years  Once again  it looks like the business has plenty of room to continue paying and growing its dividend even regardless of near term business trends Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Cardinal Health s business also performed very well during the last recession  which further boosted its Dividend Safety Score  Most of the healthcare products the company distributes are non discretionary in nature  The company s ability to continue acquiring other distributors also helps it continue growing  We can see below that its sales grew each year during the recession Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Free cash flow generation is the sign of a healthy business and is the foundation needed for sustainable dividend payments  As seen below  Cardinal Health has generated free cash flow in each of its last 10 fiscal years  Distributing essential healthcare products is certainly a dependable business that throws off nice cash flow Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite earning low profit margins as a distributor  Cardinal Health has been able to generate a solid return on invested capital of about 10 12  most years to create economic value  We generally prefer to invest in businesses that can earn double digit returns with capital deployed because they can compound earnings faster and often have numerous competitive advantages Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking at the balance sheet  we can see that Cardinal Health has just over  2 3 billion in cash compared to  5 5 billion in debt  It could cover its entire book debt with cash on hand and just 1 4 years of earnings before interest and taxes  1 4   which seems very reasonable to us given the predictable earnings of the business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Cardinal Health s dividend is very safe  The company has low payout ratios  a healthy balance sheet  consistent free cash flow generation  and a portfolio of non discretionary products Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Cardinal Health has increased its regular dividend by 15  per year over the last five years and most recently raised its dividend by 13  in early 2015  The company s Dividend Growth Score of 91 also suggests that its dividend has faster growth potential than over 90  of all dividend paying stocks in the market 
As a member of the dividend aristocrats list  Cardinal Health s dividend growth is about as reliable as it gets  With a 37  earnings payout ratio over the last 12 months  very predictable cash flow generation  and potential for double digit earnings growth  we expect future dividend growth to remain strong ValuationCAH s stock trades at 15 4x forward earnings estimates and has a dividend yield of 1 9   which is in line with its five year average dividend yield 
The company has a solid track record of generating double digit earnings growth  although acquisitions have served as a strong driver  We think this business can generate sustainable earnings growth in the mid  to high single digits  reflecting the maturity of Cardinal Health s markets and the company s ability to continue playing the role of consolidator 
Under these assumptions  CAH s stock appears to offer total return potential of 8 10  per year 
We believe the stock is reasonably priced today for long term dividend investors who are comfortable with Cardinal Health s customer concentration and the risks created by healthcare reform in the U S ConclusionCardinal Health is a blue chip dividend stock that offers excellent dividend growth potential for long term investors  We believe the company will continue enjoying steady growth as it consolidates several large healthcare distribution markets 
While the stock s 1 9  dividend yield is lower than we like for companies under consideration for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio  it does appear to be reasonably priced today for dividend investors looking to pick up some exposure to the healthcare sector ",2016-02-24,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cah:-a-wonderful-healthcare-stock-trading-at-a-reasonable-price-200119397,200119397
145543,367058,CAH,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Cardinal Health  CAH ,opinion,"Cardinal Health  Inc    NYSE CAH   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for CAH broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 8 3  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CAH stock 
If that wasn t enough  Cardinal Health isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  9 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CAH ",2016-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert:-cardinal-health-(cah)-200128810,200128810
