107217,328732,CROX,Crocs vs  Skechers  Which Trendy Footwear Company Is the Better Buy ,news,"Skechers U S A   NYSE SKX  and Crocs  NASDAQ CROX  are both popular footwear companies whose shares outperformed in 2019  Sketchers shares are up about 71  over the last 52 week period  while Crocs shares are up 38   Both companies beat the S P 500 s 26  return for the same time period  Both companies have a reputation for comfort and value  but target different audiences 
Consumers love Skechers for its broad range of shoes that are trendy and offer good value  Teenagers and comfort seekers have embraced Crocs  signature lightweight clog shoes  sending sales to record levels in 2019  Celebrities like Justin Bieber have been photographed in Crocs  Post Malone s latest collaboration with Crocs sold out in under two hours on Dec  10 
Both companies had strong results for the latest quarter and impressive stock price moves  But one is the better investment 

Recent results and growth prospects for each company
Crocs has been on a growth streak  reporting third quarter 2019 revenue growth of 19 8  year over year and earnings that easily beat analyst expectations  The shoemaker known for its clogs also raised full year guidance  CEO Andrew Rees cited  another highly successful back to school season  for the strong quarter  Investors responded by sending shares up 16  after the earnings report 
Skechers also performed well during its latest quarter  with third quarter results that topped analyst estimates for both sales and earnings  International revenues  comprising 59  of total sales  were quite strong  growing at 21 9  year over year  In contrast to Crocs  earnings report  Skechers guidance for the important holiday shopping season was not as strong as expected  The casual shoe company issued guidance that was in line with analyst forecasts for the fourth quarter 
Do consumers love the brand 
Crocs are very popular with teens right now  The brand is capitalizing on  90s nostalgia and its reputation as an  ugly  shoe  That ugly factor has made Crocs the seventh most popular footwear brand among teens in the Piper Jaffray fall Taking Stock with Teens survey  The clog seller has had great success with its collaborations with other brands like Vera Bradley and celebrities like Post Malone  Actress Zooey Deschanel is also a spokesperson for the brand 
In contrast  Skechers has built a reputation on comfort and value  It s done well with children  Skechers won Children s Brand of the Year at the 2019 Footwear Industry Awards   but not teens  Skechers is also the top brand in the U S  for work  walking  and women s casual lifestyle shoes  International is an area of growth for the casual shoe company  with strength in Mexico and China  International sales were 59  of total sales  the highest in the company s history  Skechers management said they believe  international will continue to power Skechers  growth  
Valuation and the better investment
Skechers stock is trading at 17 times forward earnings  while Crocs trades at 22 times forward earnings  Compare that to competitor Nike s 29 times  and the consumer discretionary sector s 25 times  While trading at a much lower valuation than its competitor  Skechers is expected to grow its earnings by 15  in 2020 and 12  in 2021  Analysts expect Crocs to increase its earnings by 25  in 2020 
The earnings growth figure for Crocs is expected to be higher  but Skechers has a slight edge over Crocs in that its sales are less concentrated on one product family  It also sports a lower valuation  Crocs is more dependent on one key  signature product    its popular clog shoe  making it more subject to trend risk  Sales of Crocs signature clog shoe comprise about 50  of its total sales  While shares of both companies look fairly appealing based on recent performance and future growth prospects  Skechers is the better bet given its lower valuation and more diversified revenue base ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/picjd,2060009

Consumer Spending RisesU S  gross domestic product  GDP  grew more than expected in October primarily boosted by strong consumer spending  Continuous rise in consumer spending has kept the economy afloat What s more  the National Retail Federation  NRF  has predicted a solid rise in holiday sales  indicating consumers  willingness to spend further  Thus  investing in consumer discretionary stocks seems prudent as of now Impressive U S  GDP GrowthThe Commerce Department on Oct 30 reported that U S  GDP grew better than expected in the third quarter  at an annualized rate of 1 9   Though the rate was slightly lower than the second quarter s pace of 2   it was higher than the consensus estimate of 1 6  This better than expected economic data was a result of continued consumer spending and government expenditures  Personal consumption expenditure rose at a 2 9  annualized rate and government spending grew at 2  Consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  of U S  economic activity  This includes American s spending on new autos  food  health care  housing and other discretionary products  Overall  strong American consumer sentiment is driving the record long domestic expansion  in spite of headwinds from a slower manufacturing economy Strong NRF Forecasts on Holiday SalesThe continued rise in consumer spending in October and NRF s strong forecast indicate that consumer sentiment will remain robust and spending will continue to rise  This in turn will lead the U S  economy to rise in the last two months of this year On Oct 3  NRF forecast that despite the uncertain economic environment and prevailing trade warthere will be a rise in holiday spending  As per the trade associations  prediction  there will be an increase of between 3 8  and 4 2  in holiday season sales  NRF expects retail sales in November and December to rise between  727 9 billion and  730 7 billion A bigger boost can be expected in e commerce in particular  as online sales predicted by NRF can grow between 11  and 14   or between  16 2 billion to  166 9 billion  On the other hand  retailers are looking for alternative options to bypass the additional cost from a rise in tariffs  This will keep the cost of goods in check and attract consumers to buy more Grab These 5 Stocks Now With consumer spending expected to increase in the near term  we have selected four solid stocks from the

107267,328782,CROX,Whirlpool  WHR  Up 8  In 6 Months  Will The Momentum Prevail ,opinion,Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   currently remains a mixed bag as its cost containment efforts and margin expansion in North America are poised to drive growth  while high costs and softness in the Latin America and EMEA segments remain concerns  Notably  the company has been taking measures to revive its EMEA segment  Also  it is benefiting from its robust product pipeline and solid innovations In the past six months  shares of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company have increased 7 7  outperforming the  s growth of 5 5  Moreover  the company remains confident to accomplish long term financial targets  Encouragingly  management reiterated its adjusted earnings per share view for 2019  In fact  the company expects earnings to trend toward the higher end of  14 75  15 50 mentioned earlier This has triggered an upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The consensus mark for the fourth quarter and 2019 have moved north by 6 cents and 10 cents  respectively  to  4 33 and  15 35 over the past 30 days  Factors Driving Whirlpool s PerformanceWhirlpool s efforts for cost based price increments and cost reduction initiatives  focused on improving business efficiency  are reaping benefits  To counter raw material inflation and other cost headwinds  the company implemented global cost based pricing for trade customers along with initiatives to cut fixed overhead expenses by  150 million  Backed by fixed cost discipline and a favorable product price mix  it reported operating margin expansion of 100 basis points  bps  in the third quarter  It expects favorable price mix to aid margin growth throughout 2019 Despite challenging industry demand in Canada  Whirlpool continued to post positive results for the North America division  Sales for the segment improved 0 5  year over year and 0 6  on a currency neutral basis  aided by favorable price mix and solid market share gains in a moderate U S  industry environment  Operating margin in North America expanded 80 bps on favorable product price mix and continued cost discipline  This marked eighth straight quarter of margin growth for the North America segment Looking ahead  the company expects to continue delivering strong results for the region  driven by favorable price mix and price increase along with improvement in the demand environment in the United States  The company continues to anticipate operating margin of 12  or more for the region With regard to its soft EMEA segment  Whirlpool has been undertaking restructuring actions to revive the business  In fact  it remains encouraged about executing proper actions to restore sales volume and enhance operational footprint in the region  Although management revised the division s EBIT guidance for 2019 to be at the low end of the previous range  this stems from additional restructuring efforts to improve the EMEA business  Encouragingly  it expects roughly 5  volume growth in EMEA in 2019  Also  the EMEA margins are anticipated to improve during the second half  owing to cost reduction efforts  We expect the company s EMEA unit to return to growth based on the aforesaid restructuring actions Possible DeterrentsWhirlpool has been witnessing softness across its Latin America segment primarily due to weak industry demand in Mexico  In third quarter 2019  the segment s sales fell 27 9  year over year along with operating income decline of 52 5   Moreover  operating margin contracted 240 bps  as favorable product price mix and lower raw material cost inflation were more than offset by adverse currency and lower unit volume In fact  unit volume was hurt by temporary trade inventory adjustments at a major Brazil based retailer  which is likely to revive in the next quarter  Nevertheless  it revised industry demand expectations to 3 4  for Latin America  owing to a weaker than expected demand environment in Mexico  Moreover  the company projects adjusted EBIT for Latin America to be roughly 6  for 2019  after taking into consideration the impact of aforesaid trade inventory actions and sluggish demand in Mexico Also  soft China operations remained a deterrent to EBIT growth  Higher spending toward the transition of Sanyo branded products to Whirlpool brand in China pressurized margins in the third quarter  Consequently  the segment reported an operating profit of  9 million  down 30 8  from the year ago period Operating margin also contracted 140 bps in the reported quarter  as gains from rise in volume  lower raw material inflation and cost reduction efforts were more than offset by higher brand transition investments in China  Although management reaffirmed margin guidance for Asia at 3  for 2019  higher spending toward brand transition in China might continue to pressurize margins and hurt profitability Nevertheless  we expect all aforementioned growth drivers to offset these hurdles and help Whirlpool to sustain its solid momentum Key PicksBoot Barn Holdings   NYSE BOOT   has a long term earnings growth rate of 15  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Deckers Outdoor

107288,328803,CROX,Buy These 4 Stocks As Consumer Spending Rises In October,opinion,U S  gross domestic product  GDP  grew more than expected in October primarily boosted by strong consumer spending  Continuous rise in consumer spending has kept the economy afloat What s more  the National Retail Federation  NRF  has predicted a solid rise in holiday sales  indicating consumers  willingness to spend further  Thus  investing in consumer discretionary stocks seems prudent as of now Impressive U S  GDP GrowthThe Commerce Department on Oct 30 reported that U S  GDP grew better than expected in the third quarter  at an annualized rate of 1 9   Though the rate was slightly lower than the second quarter s pace of 2   it was higher than the consensus estimate of 1 6  This better than expected economic data was a result of continued consumer spending and government expenditures  Personal consumption expenditure rose at a 2 9  annualized rate and government spending grew at 2  Consumer spending accounts for nearly 70  of U S  economic activity  This includes American s spending on new autos  food  health care  housing and other discretionary products  Overall  strong American consumer sentiment is driving the record long domestic expansion  in spite of headwinds from a slower manufacturing economy Strong NRF Forecasts on Holiday SalesThe continued rise in consumer spending in October and NRF s strong forecast indicate that consumer sentiment will remain robust and spending will continue to rise  This in turn will lead the U S  economy to rise in the last two months of this year On Oct 3  NRF forecast that despite the uncertain economic environment and prevailing trade warthere will be a rise in holiday spending  As per the trade associations  prediction  there will be an increase of between 3 8  and 4 2  in holiday season sales  NRF expects retail sales in November and December to rise between  727 9 billion and  730 7 billion A bigger boost can be expected in e commerce in particular  as online sales predicted by NRF can grow between 11  and 14   or between  16 2 billion to  166 9 billion  On the other hand  retailers are looking for alternative options to

107290,328805,CROX,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Crocs  Fossil  Great Lakes Dredge   Dock  Lithia Motors And AngloGold Ashanti,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 1  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL    Great Lakes Dredge   Dock Corp    NASDAQ GLDD    Lithia Motors  Inc    NYSE LAD   and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd    NYSE AU   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  After a Drab Q3  Q4 Looks StellarThe third quarter  which has been fraught with challenges  will officially wrap up today  Sluggishness in global economic growth and impeachment inquiry into President Trump have induced mayhem in the markets  Most importantly  trade issues with China hit investors  sentiment The White House s plan to stop Chinese companies from listing on U S  stock exchanges aggravated the trade war  By the way  the Trump administration had considered limiting U S  portfolio investments into China  Even though the discussions are at an early stage  such an action could certainly impact the financial markets in a negative way and affect billions of dollars of investments On a year to date basis  the S P 500 may be up around 18   but due the aforesaid developments  the broader index  has added a meager 0 7  so far in the third quarter  The S P 500 had begun the quarter at 2 752  went as high as 3 028  before retreating  Now  the S P 500 is near the 2 860 mark and is struggling to scale back up What s in the Offing for Q4 But  there is some heartening news which can help stocks climb in the near term  The US Treasury Department recently confirmed that it is not considering the delisting of Chinese companies  at least for the time being  Such a confirmation is encouraging as otherwise the consequences for the stock market would have been far reaching given that Chinese stocks are currently worth more than  1 trillion Meanwhile  astute investors pay special attention to the  October Effect   The theory states that stocks mainly decline in October  After all  some of the worst market crashes happened in the month According to the Stock Trader s Almanac  there were mega  crashes in 1929 and 1987   In fact  the great crash that occurred on Oct 19  1987  saw the Dow plunge 22 6  in a single day  which is arguably the worst one day decline ever  The other black days  of course  were  the 554 point drop on October 27  1997  back to back massacres in 1978 and 1979  Friday the 13th in 1989  and the meltdown in 2008   per the Almanac However  the October Effect phenomenon does seem overrated  September has seen more declines than October  And from a historical perspective  October has seen the end of more bear markets than any other month  Thus  October is a month suitable for contrarian buying  At the same time  October has been relatively stronger during midterm election years  with 2018 being one such year According to Almanac  the broader S P 500 usually climbs 3 3  in midterm Octobers  way more than its typical rise of 0 9  over the month Here re the 5 Best Stocks for Q4With the fourth quarter set to dispel the glum of the third quarter  investing in fundamentally sound stocks that are poised to gain in the near term seems judicious  We have selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Such stocks also boast of a  of A or B

107332,328847,CROX,5 Stocks That Popped In September   Still Hold Momentum,opinion,The global economy is currently witnessing a slowdown owing to the lingering trade conflict between the United States

107334,328849,CROX,3 Top Momentum Anomaly Stocks To Enrich Your Portfolio,opinion,Of late  the increased market volatility  primarily due to the lingering trade tensions between the world s two largest economies  has resulted in renewed panic for many investors While it might be difficult to remain calm during a steep market decline  it s important to remember that volatility is part of investing  For long term investors  reacting emotionally to volatile trends can be more damaging to a portfolio s performance than the downturn itself  By adhering to a well thought out investment plan  investors may be better off during periods of short term uncertainty When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  This is known as momentum investing At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction There s a whole list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence  hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early  And momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such mistakes Momentum strategy works because investors initially tend to underreact to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future  Momentum investing is  thus  based on that gap in time which exists before the mean reversion occurs i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across market stages  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to be implemented as detecting these trends well ahead of time is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers when there is a short term pullback in price and rake in handsome gains Screening ParametersPercentage Change in Price  52 Weeks    Top  50  This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks  This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year Percentage Change in Price  1 Week

pullback in price Zacks Rank  1  No matter whether it is a good market or bad  stocks sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Momentum  of B or better  While ensuring solid momentum features  a momentum score of A or B knocks out a lot of the screening process  as it takes into account several factors including volume change and relative performance  Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy   handily outperform other stocks Current Price greater than  5  The prices of the stocks should not

107336,328851,CROX,5 Best Performing  Top Ranked Growth Stocks In September,opinion,Wall Street is likely to close in the green in September after a disappointing August  Despite the continuation of trade related flip flops  a major concern like the government bonds yield curve inversion  which rattled stock markets in the previous month  did not reappear in September  Moreover  a second rate cut by the Fed and the release of a series of better than expected U S  economic data allayed fears of an immediate recession Consequently  investors  confidence in risky assets like equities strengthened  Several financial experts had warned that U S  stocks may witness a repeat show of August s disappointment  Moth to date  the three major stock indexes      the Dow  the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite      have gained 2 1   2  and 1 4   respectively  reversing the losses of 1 7   1 8  and 2 6   in August Let us discuss the likely three major growth drivers of stock markets for the rest of 2019 Positive Development on Trade War FrontOn Sep 26  President Donald Trump told reporters that a U S  China trade deal could come sooner  than you think   High level delegations from both sides are scheduled to meet for fresh negotiation in the second week of October Notably  the year long trade tussle between the United States and China has not only dented the GDP growth of these two countries  but also global economic growth  Prominent economic organizations like IMF  World Bank and OECD trimmed their global growth projection for 2019  citing U S  China trade conflict as the primary reason Several financial experts have also expressed hope that any sort of positive development like an interim trade deal between the two largest trading nations of the world will be a major catalyst for stock markets Better Than Expected U S  Economic DataOn Sep 23  IHS Markit reported that U S  manufacturing PMI came in at 51 in September compared to 50 3 in August  September s reading was the highest since April  Notably  any reading above 50 means expansion of U S  manufacturing activities  Moreover  services PMI also increased to 50 9 in September from 50 7 in August On Sep 17  the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in August rebounded with a rise of 0 6   reversing a 0 1  dip in July and beating the consensus estimate of 0 2  growth  Importantly  manufacturing production  which accounted for 12  of the U S  economy  grew 0 6  in August after a decline of 0 4  in July On Sep 23  the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  which tracks homebuilders  sentiment  edged up 1 point to 68  the highest reading in a year  Moreover  existing home sales in August rose 1 3   marking the strongest pace of sales since March 2018 On

107337,328852,CROX,What Makes Tailored Brands  TLRD  A Strong Sell ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Tailored Brands  Inc    NYSE TLRD    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in TLRD A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimates revisions  For the full year  we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  1 66 a share a months ago to its current level of  1 10 Also  for the current quarter  Tailored Brands has seen two downward estimate revision versus none revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 43 cents a share from 88 cents over the past 30 days The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 12 1  in the past month Tailored Brands  Inc  Price and Consensus   So  it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Textile   Apparel industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2019-09-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-tailored-brands-tlrd-a-strong-sell-200468231,200468231

107339,328854,CROX,Here s Why Whirlpool  WHR  Stock Is Worth Holding On To,opinion,Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   is trying all means to boost growth at its EMEA segment  which has been sluggish for a while  Moreover  weak industry trends in China are hurting its Asia unit s EBIT growth  which is likely to persist in the second half  Management lowered its margin guidance for Asia to nearly 3   as it expects gains from strong India business to be more than offset by weak industry trends in China In addition  a weak industry demand across regions remains a headwind  The company reiterated its 2019 industry demand guidance for most regions  except for the North America segment  Owing to the negative industry demand witnessed in Mexico and China during the first half  the company anticipates industry demand in Latin America and Asia to be at the lower end of the prior guidance  Furthermore  Whirlpool is witnessing pressure from higher cost inflation  increased marketing and technology investments  and adverse currency Whirlpool s Strengths   Cost Productivity EffortsDespite the above mentioned drawbacks  shares of this leading home appliance maker have gained 49 3  year to date  ahead of the  s 46 8  rally  This upside is driven by Whirlpool s robust earnings surprise trend  with second quarter 2019 marking the fourth consecutive quarter of beat  Moreover  its sales reverted to a positive trend after eight straight quarters of miss  Higher sales  margin expansion and cost containment efforts as well as robust margin expansion in North America are driving the bottom line  Strength across all segments  except for EMEA  is aiding sales Backed by strong results in the first half  Whirlpool raised earnings view for 2019  Management now envisions adjusted earnings per share of  14 75  15 50  up from  14  15 mentioned earlier  In 2018  it recorded earnings of  15 16 per share Whirlpool s efforts toward cost based price increments and cost reduction initiatives  focused on improving business efficiency  are reaping benefits  To counter raw material inflation and other cost headwinds  the company implemented global cost based pricing for trade customers along with initiatives to cut fixed overhead expenses by  150 million  Fixed cost discipline coupled with favorable product price mix is likely to aid margin growth throughout 2019 For the current year  the company now anticipates adjusted EBIT margin of 6 8   which is at the higher end of the previously stated 6 5 6 8   This reflects an improvement of 50 basis points  bps  from 2018  The guidance now reflects 175 bps gain from price mix  previously 150 bps  and net cost benefits of 25 bps or just accretive to margins  Further  the company favorably revised cost inflation guidance by 50 bps for 2019  owing to slowed down raw material cost inflation With regard to its soft EMEA segment  Whirlpool has been undertaking restructuring actions to rightsize the business  In fact  it remains encouraged about executing proper actions to restore sales volume and enhance operational footprint in the region  Although management revised the division s EBIT guidance for 2019 to be at the low end of the previous range  this stems from additional restructuring efforts to improve the EMEA business Encouragingly  it expects roughly 5  volume growth in EMEA in 2019  Also  the EMEA margins are anticipated to improve during the second half  owing to cost reduction efforts  We expect the company s EMEA unit to return to growth based on the aforesaid restructuring actions Furthermore  Whirlpool s robust product pipeline  solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to achieve its goals through 2020  The company aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3 5  every year  Additionally  it targets EBIT margin to exceed 10  by 2020 and envisions earnings per share to grow 10 15  each year  It also anticipates delivering roughly 4 5  margins along with 8  margin in Europe With all said  we believe that this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock currently deserves a place in your portfolio  Whirlpool s long term expected earnings growth rate of 5 3  and a  of A further highlights the stock s potential 3 Key Picks in the Consumer Discretionary SpaceCrocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX   delivered average positive earnings surprise of 140 8  in the last four

107341,328856,CROX,After A Drab Q3  Q4 Looks Stellar  5 Top Picks,opinion,The third quarter  which has been fraught with challenges  will officially wrap up today  Sluggishness in global economic growth and impeachment inquiry into President Trump have induced mayhem in the markets  Most importantly  trade issues with China hit investors  sentiment The White House s plan to stop Chinese companies from listing on U S  stock exchanges aggravated the trade war  By the way  the Trump administration had considered limiting U S  portfolio investments into China  Even though the discussions are at an early stage  such an action could certainly impact the financial markets in a negative way and affect billions of dollars of investments On a year to date basis  the S P 500 may be up around 18   but due the aforesaid developments  the broader index  has added a meager 0 7  so far in the third quarter  The S P 500 had begun the quarter at 2 752  went as high as 3 028  before retreating  Now  the S P 500 is near the 2 860 mark and is struggling to scale back up What s in the Offing for Q4 But  there is some heartening news which can help stocks climb in the near term  The US Treasury Department recently confirmed that it is not considering the delisting of Chinese companies  at least for the time being  Such a confirmation is encouraging as otherwise the consequences for the stock market would have been far reaching given that Chinese stocks are currently worth more than  1 trillion Meanwhile  astute investors pay special attention to the  October Effect   The theory states that stocks mainly decline in October  After all  some of the worst market crashes happened in the month According to the Stock Trader s Almanac  there were mega  crashes in 1929 and 1987   In fact  the great crash that occurred on Oct 19  1987  saw the Dow plunge 22 6  in a single day  which is arguably the worst one day decline ever  The other black days  of course  were  the 554 point drop on October 27  1997  back to back massacres in 1978 and 1979  Friday the 13th in 1989  and the meltdown in 2008   per the Almanac However  the October Effect phenomenon does seem overrated  September has seen more declines than October  And from a historical perspective  October has seen the end of more bear markets than any other month  Thus  October is a month suitable for contrarian buying  At the same time  October has been relatively stronger during midterm election years  with 2018 being one such year According to Almanac  the broader S P 500 usually climbs 3 3  in midterm Octobers  way more than its typical rise of 0 9  over the month Here re the 5 Best Stocks for Q4With the fourth quarter set to dispel the glum of the third quarter  investing in fundamentally sound stocks that are poised to gain in the near term seems judicious  We have selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Such stocks also boast of a  of A or B  Here V stands for Value  G for

107371,328886,CROX,A Third Rate Cut Hinges On Interim Trade Deal  Likely Gainers,opinion,After refraining from reducing benchmark interest rate for nearly eleven years  the Federal Reserve opted for 50 basis points cut in interest rate in two tranches in a span of less than two months this year Yet  it failed to generate enthusiasm among market participants  who had a muted response to Fed s decision  The reason is that  both times  Fed failed to provide a clear indication of a follow up rate cut  likely to come within next 2 3 months Fed Chair Jerome Powell has always maintained that the central bank will do whatever necessary to sustain U S  economic expansion and accordingly take decision for further rate cut At present  lingering trade disputes between the United States and China is the primary source of global economic disturbance irrespective of any geopolitical conflict or oil shock  Consequently  possibility of a third rate cut this year depends on the reality of a U S  China interim trade deal A Divided Fed Cuts Rate AgainOn Sep 18  after its two day FOMC meeting  the Fed decided to reduce the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 1 75 2   in line with market expectations  Notably  this was the second rate cut this year after one of similar magnitude on Jul 31 However  the Fed failed to arrive at a unanimous decision  Notably  five members were strongly against a second rate cut  while five members approved the second cut but stated that interest rate should stay there for the rest of the year  Meanwhile  seven Fed members want a third or may be a fourth reduction of benchmark interest rate this year The central bank again highlighted the same reasons for the recent rate cut as the first time  A relatively stable U S  economy is suffering due to global economic slowdown  The trade dispute and muted inflation are the two factors cited for the consecutive rate cut  While strong consumer spending is driving the economy  business fixed investment and exports are suffering due to tariff war Trade Dispute is the Major ConcernNeither the United States nor China has appeared victorious in the trade battle so far  Instead both countries along with the global economy have been suffering over the past year owing to slowing growth and exports Imposition of tariff on low cost Chinese intermediary products raised prices of final high tech products of U S  companies  Higher input costs  shrinkage in exports and lack of proper government policies resulted in a plunge in business investments Moreover  the majority of new tariffs  proposed by the Trump administration  will be implemented on consumer goods  This may significantly affect consumer spending  the largest component of the U S  GDP  Additionally  U S  agricultural business is also suffering due to higher Chinese tariff The situation in China is even worse  In the second quarter of 2019  China s economic growth fell to the lowest level in 27 years  Industrial production in August grew at the slowest pace since February 2002  Retail sales in August and investment in fixed asset in the first eight months of 2019 fell below consensus estimates China s imports have fallen in six out of the first seven months this year  indicating sluggish economic growth  Lower Chinese imports are strongly affecting several Eurozone and emerging market economies   Fed s Future Course of Action Depends on Interim Trade DealOn Sep 12  President Donald Trump told reporters that he is not averse to an interim trade deal with China although his preference will be to have a full agreement resulting in a complete trade deal with the Asian economic powerhouse Bloomberg reported that the U S  government would like to delay the imposition of new tariffs on Chinese goods or it may even roll back some tariffs that are already levied on China for the first time since the trade dispute started in March 2018 In return  the U S  government wants China to substantially increase imports of domestic agricultural products  Also  more importantly  China must comply with their earlier commitments related to the use and application of intellectual properties  before the trade negotiation broke down in May After a rough August  when the year old trade conflict between the United States and China heightened  it seems that tensions are now cooling on both sides  Several initiatives have been taken by the economic giants this month to restart the negotiation process Although no one is thinking of an immediate solution to the trade dispute  these developments should help in defusing growing trade induced economic slowdown and stock market volatility As a result  Fed s decision of a third rate cut this year depends largely on how the prolonged trade spat between the two largest trading countries of the world takes shape in the next two to three months Likely Gainers of a Third Rate CutA third rate cut would happen if the Fed thinks that the economy is not out

the Dow  the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite    are gradually approaching another all time high after July  The impressive stock market rally  which commenced at the beginning of this year  has been maintained to date except some fluctuations in May and August A fundamentally stable U S  economy  which is growing for the historically longest 11 years    albeit with some loss in pace and a dovish monetary stance adopted by Fed in 2019    has strengthened investors  confidence in risky assets like equities despite heightened trade conflict between the United States and China for more than a year Major Indexes NorthboundThe S P 500 Index    generally utilized by market participants as the barometer of the broad market movement    is up 19 9  year to date  The index is just 0 6  below the all time closing high of 3 025 86 that it set in Jul 26  2019  It needs to move another 0 7  to touch its all time intraday high of 3 027 98 recorded on the same day The Dow    the 30 stock blue chip

raised the benchmark interest rate four times in 2018 to 1  higher  which market participants largely blamed on the disappointing performance of Wall Street and the U S  China trade conflict  However  since the beginning of 2019  the central bank has adopted a dovish stance  which helped to defuse trade related volatilities to a great extent After a long period of 11 years  Fed has reduced the benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points in two tranches this year so far  Several market participants still consider a third rate cut of same magnitude by the Fed within this year  Although Fed

107392,328907,CROX,Strong Consumer Spending Fuels Q2 GDP  6 Top Picks,opinion,Last month  the Department of Commerce s initial estimate for second quarter GDP pushed the economy s most widely watched metric below the level recorded for the first quarter  Now  the latest estimate for the gauge has moved even lower  as was widely expected  Economists are attributing the slide to the fallout of the bitter U S  China trade war The petering out of the impact of Trump s tax cuts is believed to be another reason for this significant decline in growth  However  GDP still surpassed some estimates  only due to the contribution from strong consumer spending This is why it still makes good sense to invest in consumer discretionary stocks  which derive strength from personal spending  universally acknowledged as the engine of the U S  economy Trade War  Receding Impact of Tax Cuts Hurt GDPPer the Commerce Department s second estimate  GDP for the second quarter currently stands at an annualized rate of 2   This is marginally lower than the pace of 2 1  estimated last month  It represents an even more significant slowdown from the 3 1  pace recorded in the first quarter  The economy expanded 2 6  during the first half of 2019 Economists attribute this deceleration to the U S  China trade war  The conflict shows no sign of ending and has reduced business investment and hurt manufacturing  It now threatens to end the 11 year long economic expansion  Another reason for the loss in economic momentum is the receding impact of Trump s tax cut and government spending drive  Consumer Spending to the RescueThough the Fed Chair thinks that the economy is favorably positioned  the central bank is closely observing events  Jerome Powell has stated time and again that the Federal Reserve will  act as appropriate  to sustain the pace of economic momentum  Last month s rate cut supports such a view and markets have already penciled in another reduction in rates after the Fed s September meeting At this point  the only saving grace for the economy is the robust pace of consumer spending  The Department of Commerce raised its estimate for growth in consumer spending from 4 3  to 4 7  for the second quarter  The metric  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  benefited from higher spending overall  especially on autos  apparel and

107393,328908,CROX,5 Great Stocks To Buy On Robust Consumption Expenditure,opinion,In July  U S  consumer spending increased significantly  indicating that worries about a near term recession were probably overblown  These are great tidings for the financial markets and in particular for those who have been worried that economic weaknesses could upend the market rally  However  robust and steady consumption will likely dispel such fears sooner rather than later The report is largely in line with the tone witnessed in the latest second quarter GDP data  which was fueled by consumer spending alone  This is why it still makes good sense to invest in consumer discretionary stocks  which derive strength from personal spending  widely acknowledged as the engine of the U S  economy July s Consumer Spending Beats EstimatesConsumer expenditure increased 0 6  in July  fueled by households  purchases of a variety of goods and services  The increase exceeded the consensus estimate of 0 5  by a whisker and represents a solid improvement over June s gain of 0 3   Notably  consumer spending accounts for the bulk of U S  GDP After accounting for inflation  consumer spending experienced a 0 4  increase in July  This is a major improvement over the 0 2  increase experienced in June  The improvement in core consumption expenditure indicates that consumption remains solid in the early part of the third quarter This is an encouraging development after the metric advanced at its fastest pace in four and a half years last quarter  Expenditure on goods increased 0 9  in July  fueled by higher spending on recreational products and sports vehicles  Expenditure on services increased 0 5  Strong Consumption Fuels Q2 GDPThe latest estimate for second quarter GDP also indicated that consumption remains the dominant force when it comes to economic growth  The Department of Commerce raised its estimate for growth in consumer spending from 4 3  to 4 7  for the second quarter  The metric benefited from higher spending overall  especially on autos  apparel and restaurants Strong consumer spending also helped American businesses rack up their first increase in profits in three quarters  The 5 3  rise in adjusted pretax corporate profits was also the first since mid 2014  Higher spending also contributed to a decline in inventory accumulation during the second quarter

NASDAQ FNKO   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog Consumer Spending Fuels Q2 GDP  Top PicksLast month  the Department of Commerce s initial estimate for second quarter GDP pushed the economy s most widely watched metric below the level recorded for the first quarter  Now  the latest estimate for the gauge has moved even lower  as was widely expected  Economists are attributing the slide to the fallout of the bitter U S  China trade war The petering out of the impact of Trump s tax cuts is believed to be another reason for this significant decline in growth  However  GDP still surpassed some estimates  only due to the contribution from strong consumer spending This is why it still makes good sense to invest in consumer discretionary stocks  which derive strength from personal spending  universally acknowledged as the engine of the U S  economy Trade War  Receding Impact of Tax Cuts Hurt GDPPer the Commerce Department s second estimate  GDP for the second quarter currently stands at an annualized rate of 2   This is marginally lower than the pace of 2 1  estimated last month  It represents an even more significant slowdown from the 3 1  pace recorded in the first quarter  The economy expanded 2 6  during the first half of 2019 Economists attribute this deceleration to the U S  China trade war  The conflict shows no sign of ending and has reduced business investment and hurt manufacturing  It now threatens to end the 11 year long economic expansion  Another reason for the loss in economic momentum is the receding impact of Trump s tax cut and government spending drive  Consumer Spending to the RescueThough the Fed Chair thinks that the economy is favorably positioned  the central bank is closely observing events  Jerome Powell has stated time and again that the Federal Reserve will  act as appropriate  to sustain the pace of economic momentum  Last month s rate cut supports such a view and markets have already penciled in another reduction in rates after the Fed s September meeting At this point  the only saving grace for the economy is the robust pace of consumer spending  The Department of Commerce raised its estimate for growth in consumer spending from 4 3  to 4 7  for the second quarter  The metric  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  benefited from higher spending overall  especially on autos  apparel and restaurants  Strong consumer spending also helped American businesses rack up their first increase in profits in three quarters  The 5 3  rise in adjusted pretax corporate profits was also the first since mid 2014  Higher spending also contributed to a decline in inventory accumulation during the second quarter Our ChoicesDespite the slowdown in economic growth  the U S

Q2 Numberslululemon posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and up 35 2  from 71 cents in the year ago quarter  Earnings gained from solid top line growth along with gross margin gains and SG A leverage lululemon athletica inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    The Vancouver  Canada based company s quarterly revenues advanced about 22  to  883 4 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  844 3 million  On a constant dollar basis  revenues rose 23   backed by strong execution across all parts of the business  The improvement can also be attributed to robust total comparable sales  comps  performance and addition of stores  However  currency headwinds impacted revenues by  8 4 million  Notably  e commerce contributed  218 million to sales  representing about 24 6  of total sales Total comps  including comparable store sales and direct to consumer  DTC  sales  grew 15  and were up 17  in constant dollars  Comps growth was driven by rise in traffic and conversion rates across stores and online  Comparable store sales improved 10   or an increase of 11  in constant dollars  while DTC sales grew 30   or an increase of 31  in constant dollars  MarginsGross profit rose 23  to  485 8 million in second quarter fiscal 2019  Moreover  gross margin expanded 20 basis points  bps  to 55  on a 90 bps improvement in the product margin partly offset by 20 bps deleverage of occupancy and depreciation expenses  and 30 bps increase in product and supply chain costs  Additionally  gross margin included a negative currency impact of 20 bps  The product margin expansion was backed by reduced product costs  favorable product mix and lower markdowns  partly negated by incremental air freight costs incurred to evade the anticipated port congestions due to China tariffs  Further  higher product and supply chain costs stemmed from the ongoing investments in supply chain and product development  including a new distribution center in Toronto SG A expenses rose 21 3  to  317 8 million but declined 20 bps to 36   as a percentage of sales  The SG A leverage mainly resulted from a 90 bps decline in store costs and foreign exchange  Partly negated by 70 bps deleverage due to continued investments to strengthen business   including brand awareness  and initiatives to boost current and long term growth Driven by gross margin growth and the SG A leverage  operating income grew nearly 25  to  168 million while operating margin expanded 50 bps to 19  Store UpdatesDuring the fiscal second quarter  the company opened five stores  Further  it completed eight store optimizations  including the inauguration of

repurchase plan announced at the beginning of fiscal 2019 Q3 ForecastsFor third quarter fiscal 2019  lululemon anticipates revenues of  880  890 million  with constant dollar total comps expected to increase in the low teens The company expects gross margin to be flat to increase marginally in the fiscal third quarter compared with the year ago quarter  The soft gross margin will partly reflect impacts of the newly imposed China tariffs and additional costs to airfreight products Providing details on the estimated impacts of tariff and related air freight charges  the company stated that it expects these headwinds to have a negative impact of 4 5 cents on fiscal 2019 earnings within gross margin  Notably  the company incurred nearly 1 cent of these costs in the fiscal second quarter and expects the remaining 3 4 cent impact to be evenly spread in the third and fourth quarters  Despite these headwinds  the company is optimistic about opportunities to deliver further growth in product margins in the long run  It anticipates gains from the execution of strategies to aid supply chain and efficiencies of its distribution network along with benefits of scale to result in modest gross margin expansion annually through 2023 Coming back to the fiscal third quarter view  management anticipates SG A expense rate to decline marginally  as it establishes a balance between investments for future growth and efficient cost management  lululemon envisions earnings of 90 92 cents per share for the fiscal third quarter compared with 71 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  Effective tax

Crocs Inc    NASDAQ CROX    Skechers U S A  Inc    NYSE SKX    Tandem Diabetes Care Inc    NASDAQ TNDM    CyberArk Software Ltd    NASDAQ CYBR   and Fortinet Inc    NASDAQ FTNT   Beyond Earnings Growth  Focus on Beat with These 5 StocksPlain and simple earnings growth may no longer entice investors  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big it is  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most and leads one to a lucrative investment What s an Earnings Beat A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release This is because investors always try to take position ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with stellar performances  Now  since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation  their estimates act as investment leads Why Give Earnings Beats So Much Precedence After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt Also  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception How to Find Stocks that Can BeatNow  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s consistency in surpassing estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or

107417,328932,CROX,Solid Consumer Confidence Confirms Economic Stability  5 Picks,opinion,On Aug 27  the Conference Board reported strong consumer confidence data for the month of August surprising many economists  Despite significant deterioration in the trade conflict between the United States and China  bond market s frequent signal of an impending recession and a global economic slowdown  failed to deter general consumers  sentiments Notably  consumer spending constitutes around 70  of the U S  GDP while business spending generates nearly 12   Therefore  strong consumer spending indicates that the U S  economy  which is currently in its record 11th year of expansion  is likely to maintain momentum Robust Consumer Confidence in AugustFor August 2019  the Conference Board s measure of consumer confidence index stands at 135 1  slightly below the revised reading of 135 8 in July  August s reading is near the 19 year high of 137 9 recorded in October 2000 and above the consensus estimate of 128 The Present Situation Index  which gauges consumers  views on current market conditions  climbed from 170 9 to 177 2  marking its highest since November 2000  However  the Expectations Index  which is a measure of consumers  short term  for the next six months  outlook for income  business and labor market conditions  declined to 107 from 112 4 in July Consumer Spending Remains StrongOn Aug 15  the Department of Commerce reported a 0 7  jump in retail sales in July compared with 0 3  in June and the consensus estimate of 0 2   Notably  online retail sales rose 2 8

Department of Labor reported that U S  productivity  output per hour work  increased 2 3  in the second quarter of 2019  surpassing the consensus estimate of growth of 1 5   Higher productivity will enable producers to raise workers  pay without hiking the price of finished products  Consequently  higher wage will benefit workers raising their level of living   The above scenario clearly shows that U S  consumer spending has remained robust so far in the third quarter after it rebounded in the second quarter Tariff War Versus Fed PutDespite several healthy consumer centric data  escalation of tariff war between the United States and China becomes a major concern  President Trump has decided to raise tariff rate to 15  from 10  on a new set of Chinese products worth  300 billion  Most of these tariffs will be levied on consumer goods  which is likely to affect the well being of U S  consumers However  accommodative monetary stance of the Fed can help the economy to withstand trade related disturbances  The Fed has reduced the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in July for the first time since December 2008  Recently  the Fed Chair Jerome Powell has reaffirmed his earlier pledge that the central bank will do whatever needed to sustain U S  economic expansion  The market currently overwhelmingly believes that the Fed will again cut rate in September by at least a quarter percentage point  Lower interest rate will lower the cost of capital to both individuals and businesses Our Top Picks  At this stage  it will be better to invest in consumer centric stocks

107429,328944,CROX,Beyond Earnings Growth  Focus On Beat With These 5 Stocks ,opinion,"Plain and simple earnings growth may no longer entice investors  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big it is  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most and leads one to a lucrative investment 
What is Earnings Beat 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
This is becauseinvestors always try to take position ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with stellar performances  Now  since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation  their estimates act as investment leads 
Why to Give Earnings Beat So Much of Precedence 
After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt 
Also  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  since it is difficult to foretell if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s consistency in surpassing estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 5   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 10   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 10   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 5   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to seven 
Here are five out of the seven stocks 
Crocs Inc    NASDAQ CROX    This Zacks Rank  1 company is a world leader in innovative casual footwear for men  women and children  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 21    You can see

North America edged up 3 6  to  2 9 billion  while it grew 3  on a currency neutral basis  Operating profit margin expanded 50 bps to 12 4  primarily backed by favorable product price mix that was

107444,328959,CROX,Relative Price Strength Make These 5 Stocks Worth A Look Now,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this

lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate but sales beat  Adjusted earnings came in at 26 cents per share from continuing operations  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents On a pro forma basis  the bottom line declined year over year  This downturn can be attributed to escalated operating expense due to higher stock based compensation and interest expenses from assumed HRG debt Deeper InsightSpectrum Brands  net sales increased 2 7  year over year to  906 7 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  874 million  This upside was backed by a 14  rise in its Home

Personal Care segment declined 4 1  to  221 7 million primarily due to decrease in personal care revenues  somewhat negated by growth in small appliances revenues  Excluding adverse foreign currency impacts  organic net sales inched up 1   Nonetheless  the segment s adjusted EBITDA of  4 5 million significantly plunged from  20 1 million Global Pet Supplies segment s sales grew 1 8  year over year to  214 9 million chiefly driven by robust growth in U S  companion animal revenues  partly mitigated with fall in U S  aquatics sales and pet food revenues in Europe  Excluding the adverse foreign currency impacts  organic sales rose 4 2   However  the segment s adjusted EBITDA fell 8 1  to  32 8 million The Home   Garden segment s sales increased 14 1  to  139 million mainly on account

107534,329049,CROX,5 Top Notch Liquid Stocks To Reap High Portfolio Returns,opinion,Liquidity indicates a company s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into cash and equivalents  Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have potential for boosting portfolio returns However  one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks  While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared with others in its domain  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity for identifying potential gems as this combination is reflective of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other

exchange  organic net sales dropped 3 4  The company s gross profit decreased 4 1  year over year to  305 3 million  However  gross margin expanded 30 basis points  bps  to 34 9  mainly owing to

amortization  EBITDA  decreased 13 1  to  115 3 million in the fiscal first quarter  Also  adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 120 bps to 13 2  on higher distribution and advertising costs coupled with adverse mix  Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segmental PerformanceSpectrum Brands reclassified its reporting segments into Hardware   Home Improvement  HHI   Home   Personal Care  HPC   Global Pet Supplies  PET  and Home   Garden  H G   effective first quarter fiscal 2019  Markedly  the company s newly created Home   Personal Care segment includes Personal Care and Small Appliances businesses Spectrum Brands  Hardware   Home Improvement segment s sales fell 6 4  to  305 1 million mainly due to the absence of robust U S  hurricane recovery demand in residential security  plumbing and builders  hardware last year  Also  sluggishness in the housing markets negatively impacted the segment s sales  Excluding adverse foreign currency impacts  the segment s organic sales declined 5 9  year over year  Moreover  adjusted EBITDA at the segment fell 7 3  to  55 6 million Sales at Home   Personal Care segment were down 7 3  to  317 2 million  primarily due to decrease in global personal care revenues and somewhat lower global small appliances revenues  While sales at Personal care category declined double digit in the United States  small

of its common stock  The GAC business mainly includes appearance  performance and A C recharge product categories Earlier  Spectrum Brands offloaded its Global Battery and Lighting Business to Energizer for  2 billion in cash  Following these strategic arrangements  management remains on track to execute actions like debt reduction to materially improve capital structure in fiscal 2019

107549,329064,CROX,Check These 5 Top Ranked Liquid Stocks For Alluring Returns,opinion,Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into cash  Liquid stocks have always been in demand owing to potential for providing maximum returns However  one should be careful before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level might mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared with others in its domain  it may also suggest that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is reflective of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth Score less than or

107592,329107,CROX,5 Stocks With Recent Price Strength Despite Volatile Market ,opinion, In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1 or 2  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just seven Here we present five stocks out of those seven Inseego Corp    NASDAQ INSG   provides software as a service  Internet of Things  and mobile solutions worldwide  The company s stock price has advanced 57 4  in the last four weeks  It has expected earnings growth of 290  for current year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current

BRG   5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength Despite a Volatile Market In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week

Then you may be a tortoise investor 
Remember  there s no  right  answer but most people know what they gravitate towards  If you re going to invest  you might as well be comfortable in your investing style 
The Hare Is Winning
Over the last 2 years  the growth strategy has been winning the race 
The Vanguard S P 500 Growth ETF    has crushed the returns of both the S P 500 and the Value S P 500 ETF  The growth big caps are up 26  over that two year period while the S P 500 is up 15  and the value big caps are up just 4 2  
But past performance doesn t guarantee future returns 
2 Top Hare Stocks Right Now
To find some of the top  hare  stocks  aka companies with big growth in both earnings and sales  screen for Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  along with a top 50  Industry Rank 
You can even add a top Zacks Style Score of A or B on top of that in addition to double digit earnings and or sales growth Crocs Inc    NASDAQ CROX   is a shoe manufacturer which has found its shoes back on trend  Shares jumped 127  in the last year  It s not cheap  with a forward P E of 28 5 but it is seeing big earnings growth  Can it keep the momentum Five Below  Inc    NASDAQ FIVE   is a fast growing retailer for tweens and teens where all the items are priced  5 or below  It has a forward P E of 44 1 but sales are expected to rise 22  in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020  Shares have jumped 76  in the last year  Is there anything left in the tank 2 Top Tortoise Stocks Right Now
You can run the same screen you ran for growth stocks  but switching out the hyper earnings growth for value fundamentals  to find the tortoise stocks 
Remember to screen for the Zacks Rank as well so that you can get the added advantage of rising earnings estimates AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   is really cheap  with a forward P E of just 9 9  The biopharmaceutical company also has some growth  as it sports a PEG ratio of 0 9  A PEG ratio under 1 0 indicates a company has both value and growth  Over the last year  shares have retreated 16 5  as the drug stocks have been out of favor with Wall Street  Is this a buying opportunity J  Jill   NYSE JILL    the women s apparel and accessory retailer  is trading with a forward P E of just 8 4  Over the last year  shares have plunged 31   It s a small cap and shares remain volatile  They re also trading under  10 which adds to the volatility  But investors can find some bargains among the retail stocks as they have  once again  gone out of favor Remember  just because the hares have had the upper hand the last 2 years  doesn t mean that they will remain ahead in the race

5 Stocks with Impressive Relative Price Strength to Scoop Up
 
 
Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average 
 
 
On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it 
 
 
However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands 
 
 
Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy 
 
 
Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains

107613,329128,CROX,Tap 4 Best Performing Liquid Bets To Boost Portfolio Returns,opinion,Investing in liquid companies is considered profitable as liquidity measures a company s financial health  It measures a corporate entity s ability to meet short term debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Companies with favorable liquidity levels are not only reckoned to be financially strong but are also believed to generate healthy returns  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of more than 7 700 stocks to only five Here are four of the five stocks that qualified the screen Niwot  CO based  Crocs  Inc

article include  Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    Novanta Inc    NASDAQ NOVT    Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   and Bruker Corp    NASDAQ BRKR    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Tap 4 Best Performing Liquid Bets to Boost Portfolio ReturnsInvesting in liquid companies is considered profitable as liquidity measures a company s financial health  It measures a corporate entity s ability to meet short term debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Companies with favorable liquidity levels are not only reckoned to be financially strong but are also believed to generate healthy returns  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition For the

107641,329156,CROX,4 Top Stocks With Earnings Beat Potential ,opinion,"Plain and simple earnings growth may no longer entice investors  Now  earnings improvement  no matter how big it is  seems inadequate for solid moves in the market  It is the  BEAT  that matters the most and leads one to a lucrative investment 
What Makes Earnings Beat Superior to Earnings Growth
Investors always try to prepare themselves ahead of time and search for stocks poised to come up with a stellar performance  After much thinking  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  These estimates act as investment leads  Historically  if a company s earnings beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
This is becausea 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Since it is difficult to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Only companies with a Strong Buy or Buy rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10  Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to only four 
Here are all four stocks 
Crocs Inc     NASDAQ CROX     This Zacks Rank  1 stock is a world leader in innovative casual footwear for men  women and children  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 31   
Abercrombie   Fitch Company    NYSE ANF     The company is into retailing of apparel and shoes  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 26   and sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
salesforce com Inc     NYSE CRM     The Zacks Rank  2 stock is the market and technology leader in on demand business services  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 29   
Sprint Corporation    NYSE S     The Zacks Rank  2 company offers communications services  The stock hails from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 25

107642,329157,CROX,5 Stocks With Impressive Relative Price Strength To Scoop Up,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0Relative   Price change   1 week greater than 0 We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S P 500 over the last 12 weeks  four weeks and one week    Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0  Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks   that have returned more than 26  annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years   can get through  You can see  Current Price greater than or equal to  5 and Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000 A minimum price of  5 is a good standard to screen low priced stocks  while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity  less than or equal to B Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF

107661,329176,CROX,5 Top Ranked Liquid Stocks For A Winning Portfolio,opinion,Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with strong liquidity  Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed

initiatives appear impressive  Moreover  the company continues to witness solid momentum at its Tommy Hilfiger brand  Notably  it boasts a robust surprise trend  having outpaced earnings estimates for the 18th straight quarter when it reported third quarter fiscal 2018 results However  shares of PVH Corp have lost 16 2  in the past three months  wider than the  s 9 2  decline Softness across its Calvin Klein business in the recently reported quarter weighed on sales  which has hurt sentiments  Notably  the top line lagged estimates in the fiscal third quarter  after eight positive surprises While Calvin Klein s revenues edged up 2   the brand s EBIT fell 15  year over year  Calvin Klein s comparable store sales  comps  also declined 2   Weakness across the brand s 205 W39 NYC halo business and issues related to its Jeans business due to fashion miss negatively impacted results  Though management is striving to address these headwinds  it expects to see improvements in fiscal 2019   Consequently  Calvin Klein s revenues are expected to decline 6   or 3  on a currency neutral basis  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 Additionally  management has issued dismal total revenues guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter  PVH Corp expects total revenues to decrease nearly 4  year over year and 1  at constant currency against improvement of 19  and 13   at constant currency  in the year ago period  In fact  the quarterly revenues are likely to be hurt by roughly  125 million due to reduction of 53rd week and calendar misalignment in fiscal 2018 Brand wise  revenues are expected to decline 4   or flat at constant currency  at Tommy Hilfiger and 2  at Heritage Brands  In fourth quarter fiscal 2017  PVH Corp registered revenue growth of 23  at Calvin Klein and 22  at Tommy Hilfiger  while the metric was flat at Heritage Brands  Volatile geopolitical environment  stiff competition and tariff related woes are added concerns Can PVH Corp Bounce Back While softness in the top line is a daunting concern  PVH Corp looks poised to gain from its efforts to revive its Heritage Brands segment  as well as strength in digital and international operations  Further  a raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 drives optimism PVH Corp has also been enriching its digital experiences  In October this year  management announced that Wirecard   a global digital

delivery of their ordered products  making it convenient for them to try styles and other attributes  These innovative and modern technologies enhance customers  shopping experience  and are expected to drive the company s top line and overall profitability Furthermore  the company s international business remains sturdy owing to solid performance in Europe and Asia  Tommy Hilfiger  PVH Corp s

by a stellar performance in all regions and channels  and comps growth of 13   Its North America business also witnessed revenue growth of 3  Additionally  PVH Corp has been extending the reach and distribution of Heritage Brands as evident from launch of an integrated e commerce site for the brand  It announced the launch of IZOD premium brand in Europe  across Spain  Germany  the Netherlands and Scandinavia in fall  Management plans to expand the brand s distribution in Europe  Russia and the Middle East regions in spring next year Coming to guidance  PVH Corp envisions adjusted earnings per share of  9 33  9 35 for fiscal 2018  up from the  9 20  9 25 range guided previously  This also reflects a sharp increase from  7 94 earned in fiscal 2017  Though management issued bleak revenues outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter  adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be  1 58  1 60 compared with  1 58 recorded in the year ago quarter Despite the odds  we expect the afore

107716,329231,CROX,4 Top Ranked Liquid Stocks For Impressive Returns,opinion,"Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their funds in stocks with significant liquidity  Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to generate higher returns as liquidity drives growth However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see   Growth Style Score less than or equal to B Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B

107717,329232,CROX,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Herbalife  Crocs  Attunity And Cadence Design,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 15  2018   Stocks in this week s article are Herbalife Nutrition Ltd    NYSE HLF    Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    Attunity Ltd    NASDAQ ATTU   and Cadence Design Systems Inc    NASDAQ CDNS   Top Ranked Liquid Stocks for Impressive ReturnsInvestors seeking strong returns may allocate their funds in stocks with significant liquidity  Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to generate higher returns as liquidity drives growth  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination indicates underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have

in this week s article Crocs Inc    NASDAQ CROX    Transcat  Inc    NASDAQ TRNS    Mobile TeleSystems   NYSE MBT    Regions Financial Corp    NYSE RF   and LATAM Airlines Group S A    NYSE LTM   5 Breakout Stocks Offering Impressive ReturnsUtilizing a breakout investment strategy is a favored choice of active investors who are content only with returns superior to most other investments  This approach involves homing in on stocks trading within a tight range and acquiring them when they move out of this band  In keeping with this approach  they are sold whenever they move below this narrow band  If properly implemented  such a strategy could deliver impressive returns Identifying Breakout LevelsThe key to this strategy is calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The floor of a stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the resistance is a stock s breakout level and it can gain substantially if it breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand  demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Is This a Genuine Breakout The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a genuine breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have

107742,329257,CROX,Crocs  CROX  Enters Overbought Territory,opinion,"Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX   has moved higher as of late  but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company  That is because CROX is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 74 03 
What is RSI  
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet CROX s high RSI value isn t the only reason for investors to be concerned  as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in Crocs  stock as of late  This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of CROX s prospects for the near term 
Over the past one month  investors have witnessed 1 earnings estimate revision lower compared to none higher for the current year  The consensus estimate for CROX has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too  as the estimate has fallen from  0 33 share two months ago to just  0 31 share today 
If this wasn t enough  Crocs also has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth

and Pilgrim s Pride Corporation  Nasdaq    NASDAQ PPC       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Don t Panic About Market Volatility  Buy 5 Low Beta StocksBehind a successful investor is a lot of homework  There is no thumb rule that for getting lucrative returns  one should invest in risky stocks although the strategy works well when the market is bullish We have created an investment strategy which proves that less risky stocks could also give handsome returns if some parameters are taken into account Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate

107758,329273,CROX,4 Top Liquid Stocks For A Winning Portfolio,opinion,Investors may consider allocating their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions for big returns  Liquidity indicates a company s capability of meeting debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksLiquidity ratios like Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a high number may indicate inefficiency in using the cash So  a ratio of greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always underline a company s financial health Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see    Growth Style Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks

product margins over a year International Growth Resonates With Strategy for 2020Lululemon has been progressing well with its goals for 2020  by which the company aims to double its revenues to about  4 billion and more than double its earnings  To achieve these targets  management outlined four distinct growth strategies  including product innovation  building store fleet in North America  expanding digital business and international expansion  While the aforementioned strategies resonate well with Lululemon s 2020 targets  the company is firing on all cylinders with regard to international expansion as well Incidentally  Lululemon remains committed toward expanding operations outside the United States and Canada  particularly in the underpenetrated European and Asian markets  Notably  the company s brand momentum grew manifold in the Asian market in the second quarter  primarily backed by spectacular Chinese performance  In Europe too  the company envisions significant growth opportunity driven by solid market growth in the second quarter  Backed by this optimism  the company plans to expand international base with the opening of 15 new stores in fiscal 2017  Further  it expects to generate  1 billion revenues from international locations in the next few years Back to Back Positive Surprises  Outlook Boosts EstimatesThe impact of these endeavors is

107790,329305,CROX,5 Top Stocks Likely To Beat Earnings This Season ,opinion,"As the third quarter earnings season unfolds  what could be a better time to talk about earnings surprises  After all  a positive earnings surprise or a beat matters the most  irrespective of earnings growth 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Seasonal fluctuations also come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
It s only after significant research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives that Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  If the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Pick Likely Achievers 
Investors tend to look for stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line but might not always succeed  One way of identifying the winners beforehand is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track record in this regard generally acts as a driver  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  Investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 11 
Here are five out of 11 stocks that passed the screen 
Guess   Inc    NYSE GES    The company designs and markets one of the world s leading lifestyle collections of casual apparel  accessories and related consumer products  The stock belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 29   It has a Zacks Rank  2

107791,329306,CROX,What s Hurting Leggett  Will Long Term Strategies Aid Revival,opinion,Leggett   Platt  Incorporated   NYSE LEG   has been going through a rough phase owing to volatility in raw material prices  However  its long term strategic plan remains on track A glimpse of Leggett s share price movement reveals that it has fallen nearly 6  year to date  wider than the  s decline of 1 6   Let s delve deeper and find out what is troubling this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Why is the Stock Struggling Disappointing Performances   Bleak OutlookInvestors remain cautious about Leggett s top line performance that has missed expectations in eight of the last nine quarters  It reported dismal top  and bottom line results in second quarter 2017 due to raw material price inflation  which more than offset benefits of higher sales and lower tax rate  Also  the inflationary pressure dented operating margins Consequently  management lowered its sales outlook for 2017 and narrowed its earnings per share guidance range  Sales for the year are now anticipated to grow by 4 7  to  3 9  4 0 billion  Earlier  the company projected sales of  3 95  4 05 billion that reflected 5 8  year over year growth  Also  it narrowed earnings to a band of  2 55  2 65 per share from the previous range of  2 55  2 75 Given the aforementioned troubles  the company s earnings estimates have witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 48 for 2017 and  2 74 for 2018 moved down 4 6  and 2 8   respectively Other HeadwindsLeggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices as steel is one of the company s key raw materials and the steel market is cyclical in nature  Evidently  Leggett s bottom line and operating margins were hurt by steel price inflation in the second quarter  In fact  fluctuating steel prices impacted Leggett s performance throughout 2016  We expect the persistence of inflationary pressure to remain a threat to Leggett s earnings in 2017 Apart from this  the company is susceptible to fluctuating metal margins as it is a manufacturer of steel rods  Alongside  intense competition from local as well as regional players and other macroeconomic factors remain threats to Leggett Strategic Long Term GoalsLeggett s long term strategic plan remains on track and it has already completed the first two parts of it successfully  While  the first part was to divest low performing businesses  the second part comprised an improvement in margins and returns  Currently  the company is working on the third part of the plan  which aims to achieve top line growth of 4  5  annually Markedly  Leggett has significant operating leverage to accomplish the third part of the plan as it has a considerable amount of retained spare production to meet the demand of  4 billion  In fact  solid market demand coupled with market share gains has been enhancing capacity utilization over the years Meanwhile  the company has been focusing on boosting its business portfolio by increasing investment in areas that provide a competitive edge  simultaneously exiting underperforming operations and markets Furthermore  in September 2016  Leggett had chalked out its goals for 2019  aimed at helping the company achieve its top third TSR target in the following three years  These targets include revenue of about  4 75 billion  operating margin of 13 3   earnings per share of  3 25 and a dividend of  1 70 per share Well  the company believes revenues growth  margin enhancement and shareholder friendly moves like buybacks and dividend payments to be the main TSR drivers  Going forward  the company expects these targets to be fueled by organic growth  which in turn is anticipated to be backed by strategic buyouts  with the absence of any non recurring factors Bottom LineThough Leggett seems in trouble now  we believe the company s long term growth plans bode well for the stock Want to Know About the Gems in the Consumer Discretionary Space Some better ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    G III Apparel Group  Ltd    NASDAQ GIII   and PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   Crocs  with a

107797,329312,CROX,Can Whirlpool s Innovation Mantra Help Shares Surge Higher  ,opinion,Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   remains committed to its innovation strategy that helps tap additional sales and gain market share  Also  the company s long term goals backed by its robust product pipeline  solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives  bode well Despite the company s solid growth drivers  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock gained only a meager 1 5  in the last six months  in line with the  s growth  However  its shares have underperformed the broader  sector s growth of 4   which is currently placed at the top 31  of the Zacks classified sectors  5 out of 16  Let s take a deep look as why the company s solid strategic efforts are not well reflected in its share price What s Weighing Upon the Stock Dismal Performance   Bleak OutlookWhirlpool delivered fourth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second quarter 2017  With this  the company has recorded an average miss of 5 8  in trailing four quarters  Further  the company s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the last seven quarters Also  Whirlpool has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017 based on elevated raw material inflation and lower product price mix in China and Europe  Management now envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of  14 50  15 00 compared with  14 75  15 50  guided earlier  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is currently pegged at  14 62 Other ConcernsWhirlpool s operating performance is significantly dependent on the price of raw materials  particularly steel  oil  plastic resins  aluminum  copper  zinc and nickel  In fact  the volatility in commodity prices has been adversely affecting the company s performance as evident from its second quarter results Notably  the costs of key raw materials  particularly steel and resins have also increased worldwide in the first half of 2017  While these headwinds were fully offset in North America and Latin America due to favorable demand and productivity gains  Europe and Asia suffered as soft demand made it difficult to offset these challenges Furthermore  Whirlpool s customer concentration is high  which is expected to negatively impact the company s margins  Also  the current challenging global economic environment is weighing on the company s performance in terms of volatility in currency and weak market demand  primarily in Brazil  China and Eastern Europe Innovation Mantra   A Secret to Success Whirlpool is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers  Evidently  the company inked a deal with Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    to introduce voice controlled home appliances  Also  Whirlpool is keen on boosting revenues of its core appliance business through expansions and investments  This  in turn  is expected to fuel growth of its high margin categories Other Strategic EndeavorsWhirlpool is striving to improve its margins through a series of measures  including cost based price increments and cost reduction initiatives that are focused on improving business efficiency  Though second quarter 2017 was disappointing from margins perspective  the company has very strong initiatives to facilitate operating margin expansion in the second half Recently  management also outlined significant long term targets through 2020  backed by brand strength and product portfolio  The company aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3 5  every year Going forward  Whirlpool anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix  This  in turn encouraged management to target its operating margin to exceed 10  by 2020  Further  the company envisions earnings per share to grow by 10 15  each year Bottom LineWe expect Whirlpool s robust strategies to spark a turnaround in its performance  This is likely to bolster share prices and attract investors in the near term 3 Picks You Can t MissSome better ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    G III Apparel Group  Ltd

107809,329324,CROX,Don t Panic About Market Volatility  Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks,opinion,Behind a successful investor is a lot of homework  There is no thumb rule that for getting lucrative returns  one should invest in risky stocks although the strategy works well when the market is bullish We have created an investment strategy which proves that less risky stocks could also give handsome returns if some parameters are taken into account Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They

107818,329333,CROX,Why Is Crocs  CROX  Stock Plunging 25  Today ,opinion,"On Wednesday  shares of retailer Crocs Inc    NASDAQ CROX   are plunging  down around 24  in midday trading after the company reported lower than expected quarterly results 
Crocs posted diluted earnings per share of  0 13  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 15 per share  Net income came in at  11 7 million  up 2 1  year over year  for the second quarter  Revenues fell 6 3  to  323 8 million in comparison to the prior year and missed our consensus estimate of  349 million 
Crocs CEO Gregg Ribatt blamed the global retail environment as a whole  saying it  impacted our wholesale reorder opportunities and contributed to our sales shortfall relative to expectations Despite a decline in our revenue  I am encouraged by our strategic progress which has enabled us to help mitigate the top line pressure on profitability by delivering better than expected gross margins and managing expenses while reducing inventories   
As a result  the company has lowered its revenue forecast for Q3 to between  245 million  255 million  well below analyst expectations of  289 52 million  And for the full year  Crocs expects revenue to down low single digits compared to the year ended December 31  2015  This new guidance reflects a more cautious retail industry as well as slower turnaround in China 
CROX currently sits at a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  The stock has fallen roughly 27  in the past 12 months as of Tuesday s close

107821,329336,CROX,Should You Get Rid Of Crocs  CROX  Now ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Crocs  Inc    NASDAQ CROX    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in CROX A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from 22 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 6 cents CROCS INC Price and Consensus   Also  for the current quarter  Crocs has seen 3 downward estimate revisions versus zero revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to a penny per share from 17 cents over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 31 8  in the past month So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Textile industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and may be a better selection at this time ,2016-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-get-rid-of-crocs-(crox)-now-200147681,200147681

Calvin Klein s revenues advanced 8  year over year to  786 million  including about  15 million impact from the deconsolidation of PVH s business in Mexico in November 2016  The improvement was driven by a 20  increase in the segment s International revenues  partially offset by a 1  decline in revenues for the North America business The growth in International business was backed by solid performance of wholesale business in Europe and China  alongside robust growth in the retail business due to 6  comparable store sales  comps  increase and square footage expansion  Meanwhile

million  mainly backed by 9  sales growth in the brand s International business owing to persistent strength in Europe and Asia  and 6  comps growth However  this was partly offset by a 2  decline in

of this business to G III Apparel Group  Ltd   GIII   Further  comps for the North American business remained flat The Heritage Brands segment s revenues rose 13  year over year to  392 million due to

107843,329358,CROX,Using The Cash Conversion Cycle To Help Pick Stocks,opinion,The Cash Conversion CycleThe main way a company can make more profit is to simply sell more stuff  But how do you sell more stuff You need cash Wall Street loves earnings and many people believe earnings drive cash to profitability  but the truth is that cash drives earnings  Cash is king and is the start and the end of a business No business can start without cash  and all businesses end in cash  whether it be liquidated or sold out This is why a business that can manage its cash efficiently will do better than its competitor In the cash conversion cycle  you start off with cash  it becomes inventory and accounts payable  which then becomes sales and accounts receivables before converting into cash again The entire cash conversion cycle is a measure of management effectiveness  The lower the better  and a great way to compare competitors  The Cash Conversion Cycle Formula  Cash Conversion Cycle   Days Inventory Outstanding   Days Sales Outstanding   Days Payables Outstanding Days Inventory Outstanding  Days Inventory Outstanding shows you in days  how long it takes for inventory to be sold  The quicker inventory is sold  the better   DIO    Inventory COGS  x 365  This is an annual calculation  To calculate between two periods  use the below formula   DIO   Average inventory COGS x number of days in period Average Inventory    beginning inventory   ending inventory  2  Days Sales Outstanding  Days Sales Outstanding is the number of days it takes for a company to collect money from sales and involves accounts receivables  Obviously  a low number is better   DSO   Accounts Receivables Revenue  x 365 This is an annual calculation  To calculate between two periods  use the below formula    DSO   Average AR   Revenue x number of days in period Average AR   beginning AR   ending AR  2 Days Payables Outstanding  Days Payables Outstanding represents how many days before the company pays it off  The higher the number  the better  because that means the company can use that cash for other profitable purposes before making payments   DPO    Accounts Payable COGS  x 365 This is an annual calculation  To calculate between two periods  use the below formula   DPO   Average AP   COGS per day Average AP    beginning AP   ending AP  2 Cash Conversion Cycle of Shoe Retailers  See the charts below comparing the cash conversion cycle for Sketchers  SKX   Deckers Outdoor  DECK   Crocs  CROX   Steve Madden  SHOO   and K Swiss  KSWS   Since all these companies are involved in making and selling shoes  the cash conversion cycle is all above 50 days  but the company with the best and most consistent record is SHOO The worst offender of the bunch is currently K Swiss  I wish somebody told me about the cash conversion cycle when I bought KSWS back in 2008 and 2009  It sure would have saved me a lot of money because their troubles have continued to escalate Here s a chart that breaks down the cash conversion cycle of K Swiss Although DSO and DPO has been fairly consistent  the increase in DIO should have been a huge warning sign The other interesting company to look at is Crocs  If you go and read up on Crocs  you will find out that they had some serious inventory issues in 2007 and the cash conversion cycle climbed vertically before they slashed inventory and got a handle on it again Now take a look at the next chart of this series below to see whether cash conversion cycles matters or not The stock price direction is not entirely dependent on the cash conversion cycle  but it certainly does have a factor and is something you should check regularly too ,2012-10-22,Jae Jun,https://www.investing.com/analysis/using-the-cash-conversion-cycle-to-help-pick-stocks-140724,140724
107845,329360,CROX,Crocs  Vol Hits Multi Year Lows With Earnings Approaching ,opinion,Crocs  Inc  CROX  is a designer  manufacturer and distributor of footwear and accessories for men  women and children  As of December 31  2011  it sold its products in more than 90 countries through domestic and international retailers and distributors and directly to end user consumers through its company operated retail stores  outlets  kiosks and Webstores   I found this stock using a real time custom scan  This one hunts for depressed vols  and CROX has in fact hit a multi year low in IV30  with earnings due out in the Mar expiry   Custom Scan Details Stock Price GTE  5  IV30  GTE 20 IV30  Percentile LTE 10 Average Option Volume GTE 1 200  The goal with this scan is to identify short term implied vol  IV30   that is depressed to its own annual history  at most in the 10th percentile   I m also looking for a reasonable amount of liquidity in the options  thus the minimum average option volume   and I want a minimum vol level so I don t pick up any boring ETF s  or whatever   The stock price requirement helps me identify names that have enough strike prices to trade or spread   The six month CROX Charts Tab is included  below   The top portion is the stock price the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side we can see a number of gaps  certainly a huge one off of earnings in Oct of 2012  but even more recently the stock has made some abrupt one day moves But this is a vol note  so I have included the two year IV30  chart in isolation  below We can see pretty clearly that the level of the implied is not only at an annual low  but a multi year low  An interesting phenomenon when coupled with the fact that earnings are due out in Mar expiry  Hmm   Finally  let s look to the Options Tab  below  Across the top we can see that mar vol is well elevated to Feb  42 50  to 29 52   but still  that 42 50  feels pretty low  Certainly  the IV30  will rise as we approach earnings as will Mar vol  the question is to what level  This is a good one to put in a watchlist and check every so often as we get through Feb expiry and approach earnings Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation Images provided by Livevol ,2013-01-27,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crocs:-vol-hits-multi-year-lows-with-earnings-approaching-152521,152521
107848,329363,CROX,Volatility Plunges As Half 2015 s Gain Arrives In One Day,opinion,"T2108 Status  48 8 T2107 Status  51 7 VIX Status  12 9  down 15  General  Short term  Trading Call  Neutral Active T2108 periods  Day  139 over 20   Day  98 above 30   Day  42 above 40   overperiod   Day  4 under 50   underperiod   Day  8 under 60   Day  208 under 70 
Commentary The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   is up 2 8  year to date  exactly twice the gain of 1 4  achieved on Friday  No wonder market observers can still generate excitement on a big rally day that rests firmly within an on going chopfest 

The S P 500 continues to take 2 steps forward and 1 1 2 back  half the gains for 2015 came on Friday
The NASDAQ is also following along its 50DMA and spending a little more time above support than below 

The NASDAQ s push higher is a little clearer than the S P 500
T2108 is still lagging the S P 500  The last bout of churn took T2108 as low as 38  last week  It closed Friday at 48 9   This level means the market has plenty of upside potential  Yet  if previous patterns from this chopfest hold  the S P 500 will barely scratch out a new marginal all time high before proceeding to chop its way back to the bottom of its narrow trading  upwardly biased  channel 
Friday s strong surge took out volatility with a body blow  The VIX plunged by 15  as it hurtled toward its recent lows 

Volatility gets crushed
I had no reason to expect such a dramatic move in the wake of Friday s employment report  so I had no volatility trade on  Now  the trade is to go long volatility again  I will wait until the S P 500 makes a little more headway toward or into a new all time high 
The last trade I mentioned was a hedged play on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM   It worked out even better than I could have hoped as the gains were nearly immediate  A large plunge on Wednesday was followed by mild follow through on Thursday  I set a stop to protect profits on my very large put position  The market saw fit to take out that stop with a quickness as EEM forged a bottom for the day  That stop became a savior as EEM gapped right back up on Friday  EEM at one point had reversed all its losses from the previous two days and almost brought the call option side of the hedge back to even  I will now ride these calls as long as I can given my profits from the puts have paid for them  and much more  

iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  is producing a lot more drama than the S P 500 as it swings around its 200 and 50DMAs
There are plenty more telling charts featuring their own trading opportunities  With earnings season largely behind us  it is a little  safer  to make moves now especially moves that take advantage of post earnings momentum 
Crocs  Inc  Crocs Inc  NASDAQ CROX  surged on double its average trading volume in reaction to earnings  I have pointed out bullish patterns for CROX in the past  the last one eventually failed  Friday s reaction is a strong  confirming follow through to a surge from the previous earnings report  I wish I had been paying attention at that time because that move led to a very buyable 50DMA breakout  The subsequent upward trend channel remains well intact 

Crocs  Inc   CROX  is in bullish form again
Wix com Ltd   Speaking of missed opportunities  WIX com LTD   NASDAQ WIX  is bursting out the gate and confirming bullishness from last year  I bailed on my position after momentum appeared to end  It looked like a timely move as WIX broke below its 200DMA in March  I took my eye off the ball and completely missed a nice comeback with a pre announcement that took the stock above its 50DMA  The buy point came upon the second 50DMA breakout  WIX is now up three days straight on strong buying volume  It is above its upper Bollinger Band and should pull back in the coming week or so  I am looking to buy the dips 

Wix com Ltd   WIX  has come back strong
Coach  Inc  Coach Inc  NYSE COH  is back to experiencing rough times  Its 200DMA has slowed down a post earnings plunge  I am positioned assuming this support will hold and lead eventually to a test of resistance at the 50DMA 

The rally from recent lows has come to a sudden end from the latest earnings report  The 200DMA is so far propping up Coach  Inc 
FacebookFacebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  has recently found post earnings support at its 200DMA but its descent to this level has been very bearish  After a swift post earnings fade  FB sold off almost every single day on its way to support  It now trades below the previous triple top and has a LOT to prove again 

Facebook is clinging to 200DMA support that has finally ended its persistent post earnings slide for now
iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond
All eyes are on global bond markets  The U S  dollar has been weakening while rates rise   a hint of inflation fear in the air  iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  ARCA TLT  got over extended to the downside this past week  and I jumped in with a call spread  I moved to sell on Friday s extension of the subsequent bounce  I could not get my price so I am hanging on for now  My current target is a retest of 50DMA resistance 


iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  TLT  is under big pressure  A 200DMA breakdown delivered an over extended move to the downside 
GoPro  Inc GoPro Inc  NASDAQ GPRO  has been much maligned given its extremely high valuation and a product that sure seems vulnerable to eventual competition and commoditization  However  GPRO has experienced a nice uptrend from March lows  The gap up from earnings seemed to confirm the new momentum  The gap was quickly filled but a hammer pattern that ended right at the upward trending 20DMA seems to have provided support  GPRO is a strong buy with a stop below the post earnings low  Even after that  I strongly suspect the 50DMA will provide even firmer support 

GoPro  Inc   GPRO  is on the comeback trail  The 20DMA is providing firm support on a new upward trajectory 
Baidu  Inc   For a brief moment before earnings  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  looked like it was finally ready to break out of its downward channel and resume its upward momentum  Earnings ended those hopes quickly  The subsequent breakdown has sent the stock to the bottom of the previous downward channel and a new 10 month low  The progression is slow and choppy  but BIDU now has all the technical markers of a breakdown underway  I tried to play a bounce last week  and I was soundly rejected  I am now much more inclined to fade rallies on BIDU 

Baidu  Inc   BIDU  is in trouble as a breakdown continuesDaily T2108 vs the S P 500
