140907,362422,JBL,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Tuesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday  June 12 
1  Trump  Kim Sign  Comprehensive  Document
U S  President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  while Washington committed to provide security guarantees for its old enemy 
At the end of their historic summit in Singapore  Trump and Kim signed an agreement to work toward complete denuclearization and a lasting  peace regime  on the Korean Peninsula 
The document  which Trump deemed  very comprehensive   says the two sides commit to hold follow up negotiations and to cooperate to develop bilateral relations 
Asked about what the agreement meant for North Korea s denuclearization  Trump said  we re starting that process very quickly   very  very quickly  
Many experts expressed dismay at the agreement  however  saying it lacked a solid commitment by Pyongyang  while others said it was vague as to details 
2  Federal Reserve Kicks Off Policy Meeting
With the Trump Kim summit now out of the way  investors looked ahead to the start of the Federal Reserve s two day policy meeting this morning 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are widely expected to announce a quarter point increase in interest rates for the second time this year  as it seeks to normalize monetary policy with the economy showing signs of health 
That would put the fed funds target range in a range between 1 75  2 0   inching closer to a neutral policy stance 
With the rate hike almost fully priced in  markets are focusing on whether the Fed will hint at the prospect of four rate hikes in 2018 
The probability of four total rate hikes this year  rather than the three currently forecast by the Fed  have strengthened recently amid signs of rising inflation and strong economic growth 
3  U S  Inflation Data Eyed
Tuesday s calendar features the biggest economic data point of the week 
The Commerce Department will publish May inflation figures at 8 30AM ET  1230GMT   with traders watching to see if the data will run hotter than expected 
Market analysts expect consumer prices to rise 2 7  on a year over year basis  up from 2 5  in April 
Core inflation  which excludes food and fuel  is projected to climb 2 2   a tad faster than the 2 1  gain recorded in the preceding month 
Core prices are viewed by the Fed as a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories 
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 93 50 
In the bond market  the U S  10 year Treasury yield stood at around 2 96  
4  U S  Stocks Set For Small Losses At The Open
U S  stock futures pointed to small losses at the open  as investors looked past the Trump Kim summit  and instead focused on the start of the Fed s meeting and the latest batch of economic data 
At 5 45AM ET  1045GMT   the blue chip Dow futures were down 18 points  or less than 0 1   The S P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures also indicated similar losses at the open for their respective markets 
The largely muted moves in pre market trade followed a lackluster session Monday  which saw each of the major averages close in the green  though little changed 
The earnings calendar will be pretty empty with H R Block  NYSE HRB  and  Jabil Circuit   NYSE JBL  the most notable companies reporting results 
Elsewhere  in Europe  the majority of the continent s bourses hovered around the flatline 
Earlier  Asian markets were mostly calm  with most of the region s markets ending little changed 
5  Brexit Showdown In Focus
The Brexit issue returns to the fore  as lawmakers in the House of Commons will begin debating House of Lords amendments to the bill that takes the UK out of the European Union 
Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservative government runs the risk of losing its bid to overturn some of the amendments if enough Conservative lawmakers decide to vote alongside opposition parties 
The 15 amendments include a measure to keep the country in the EU s customs union 
On the first day of votes that could further complicate her tortured negotiations to quit the EU  parliament will debate a demand for a  meaningful vote  on any agreement May negotiates with Brussels before leaving the bloc next March 
Such a vote would give the lower house more power to set the government s  direction  if the house rejects the agreement 
The pound was a shade higher against the dollar  trading at 1 3410  GBP USD  
Pound traders also digested data showing the number of people employed in the UK continued to rise in the three months to April  while wage growth slowed ",2018-06-12,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-tuesday-1489114,1489114

140974,362489,JBL,Follow Wearables To A Hot Industry Niche,opinion,"Electronics Manufacturing Services is at  11 out of 256 industries  in the top 4   within the Zacks Industry Ranks 
Any industry group can t do better  And it s not a ranking fluke  This one has 5 companies in it 
The Electronics Manufacturing Services   known by its abbreviation as EMS   industry took off after the late 1970s when Selectron was established 
At the time  in house assembly handled most electronics manufacturing for large scale product runs  These new companies offered flexibility and eased human resources issues for smaller companies doing limited runs 
What is the typical business model for the EMS industry  
EMS companies specialize in large economies of scale in manufacturing and raw materials procurement  Then  they pool together the needed resources and apply their industrial design expertise  They also create added value services such as warranty and repairs 
This frees up the end customer  who does not need to manufacture and keep huge inventories of products  The final customer can respond to sudden spikes in their demand more quickly and efficiently 
In today s world  think about  wearables  as a solid electronics product example  aka smart watches  activity trackers and wrist bound health care devices 
What s the stock market opportunity 
Stocks in this industry have seen some rough sledding since peaking in either 2017  or at the latest  in early 2018

 By Angela Moon
 NEW YORK  Sept 29  Reuters    U S  stocks were set for
higher open on Tuesday as better than expected home sales data
for July provided further evidence that the domestic housing

Confidence Index is to rise to 57 0 for September  up from

Despite an improvement  the reading would still be considered
far from healthy  suggesting consumers are worried about more
economic woes ahead 
 U S  stocks rallied on Monday  snapping a three day losing
streak  as a spurt of corporate takeovers in the technology and

about 16 percent in the quarter so far  its best such period
since the fourth quarter of 1998

140993,362508,JBL,Should Value Investors Consider Jabil Circuit  JBL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Jabil Circuit  Inc    NYSE JBL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Jabil Circuit has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at 20 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Jabil Circuit s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Delving deeper into the PE s inputs  we observed that the company s PE multiple has fallen sharply in early 2015  This was driven by an increase in earnings  without a corresponding increase in price  These trends indicate that the stock might be trading at a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Jabil Circuit has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Jabil Circuit stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Jabil Circuit has a P S ratio of about 0 3  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  However  as we can see in the chart below  this is around the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  Jabil Circuit is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Jabil Circuit currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Jabil Circuit a solid choice for value investors For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 4 7  which is far better than the industry average of 9 8  Clearly  JBL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Jabil Circuit might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives JBL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the earnings for the current quarter and fiscal year remained stable  over the past sixty days  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Jabil Circuit  Inc  Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicating robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineJabil Circuit is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a good industry rank  among the Top 45   and strong Zacks Rank  Jabil Circuit looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but

141036,362551,JBL,Buy These 4 Momentum Stocks For Exciting Returns,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks  Translated  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time At the core  momentum investing is buying high  selling higher  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift  Thus  this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast moving train  without fretting about valuations or growth prospects  But why does the momentum strategy work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hopeful of a rebound in the prices  On the other hand  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends  and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over a long period of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you benefit from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price  52 Weeks    Top  50  This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks  This

141067,362582,JBL,Does Jabil Inc   JBL   Look To Be A Great Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Jabil Inc    NYSE JBL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Jabil has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 70  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 56  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Jabil s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Electronics industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 10  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Jabil has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 86  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Jabil stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Jabil has a P S ratio of about 0 29  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 19 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Jabil currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Jabil a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example   its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 61  which is far better than the industry average of 7 70  learly  JBL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Jabil might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives JBL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have also been pretty favorable  The current quarter has seen one estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has also seen one estimate gong up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5 9  in the past two months and the full year estimate has inched up by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Jabil  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineJabil is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 8   and strong Zacks Rank  Jabillooks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Electronics industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From

141074,362589,JBL,4 Trades To Connect With Jabil For A Move Higher,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Jabil Circuit Inc  NYSE JBL   made a bottom in May 2016 and started higher It broke over its 200 day SMA in August and consolidated for nearly the rest of the year after that  Then it gapped up following its earnings report in December and has continued to move higher  Since May this year it has built an ascending triangle  loosely with the 100 day SMA as rising support and resistance at 31 65  A break out of this triangle would look for a move of  3 60 
Momentum is positive and building  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone and making a higher high  The MACD is also crossed up and rising and far from any extreme readings  Even the Bollinger Bands  are starting to open higher allowing a move  There is no resistance over 31 60  Support lower may sit at 30 20 and 29 20 followed by 28 75 and 28  Short interest is moderate at 5 6  and the company is expected to report earnings next September 20th after the market closes 
The weekly options for the shortened holiday week show little open interest and do not give any clarity of direction  The monthly September options show big open interest at 27  28 and 30 on the put side but bigger size at 32 on the call side suggesting a possible pin level  The September 22 Expiry options  the first after the earnings report  have small activity but the largest by far is the open interest at the 32 call strike  These suggest a  2 move on the stock price between now and expiry 
Monthly October options are also light but he December options show very large open interest at the 30 and 28 put strikes  Prior to August expiration  this expiry would have been the only choice to use to hedge the September earnings report

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into the Labor Day shortened week sees equities looking stronger led by the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil sustains a small bounce in the downtrend  The US Dollar Index continues to move down with small bounces while US Treasuries are pulling back in their uptrend  The Shanghai Composite is strong consolidating a break out  ready to continue higher and Emerging Markets are rising and making 3 year highs 
Volatility looks to remain at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and QQQ  Their charts are all recovering with the SPY gaining short term strength  nearing a trend resumption while the IWM heads higher short term in a rising channel  The QQQ breaking to new all time highs looks the strongest  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Heavy dose of economic data points 
The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Housing Market Index showed homebuilder sentiment this month declined to 67 from May s downwardly revised level of 69 and while it may be at a four month low in June  remains near the highest levels in approximately 12 years 
The 50 mark is the point of separation for good versus poor conditions  The NAHB said that although still quite strong  the figures might be hinting at an easing of optimism in an industry where more workers are desperately needed to break ground on new projects  And businesses might also be less confident since post election buoyancy has given way to legislative gridlock 
Industrial production was unchanged month over month  m m  in May  falling shy of estimates calling for a 0 2  increase  and following April s upwardly revised 1 1  rise  which was the strongest surge in nearly seven years  Manufacturing production declined  while mining and utilities output ticked higher  Capacity utilization ticked lower to 76 6   compared to April s unrevised 76 7   and shy of forecasts expecting a tick higher to 76 8

European and Asian shares saw pressure
European equities traded broadly lower with retailers and commodity producers leading the decent  The decline developed on the heels of yesterday s Fed decision and in the wake of the Bank of England  BoE  keeping its monetary policy unchanged as expected  though the number of officials at the BoE calling for a rate hike has now increased to three versus the five officials who voted to stay the current policy path 
In other central bank action  the Swiss National Bank kept both its target range and the rate charged on sight deposits unchanged  as expected  In economic developments in the region  consumer price inflation reports out of France and Italy were mostly in line with projections  retail sales figures in the U K  were well short of expectations and the trade balance for the Eurozone was narrower than anticipated 
The euro moved lower versus the U S  dollar  while the British pound erased an early decline that ensued following the BoE decision and traded higher against the greenback  Bond yields in the region were mostly higher 
Stocks in Asia traded mostly lower with energy issues leading the decline on the heels of yesterday s Fed decision to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and as crude oil prices continued to slide  Mainland Chinese stocks ticked to the upside  as the People s Bank of China  PBoC  appears to be holding off on any immediate increases to borrowing costs  The PBoC raised money market costs shortly following its U S  counterpart tightening in March 
However  securities in Hong Kong fell sharply  with property firms under heavy pressure after the city s monetary authority raised borrowing costs shortly following the U S  Fed s monetary policy decision yesterday 
Japanese equities slipped  with exporters underperforming as the yen advanced versus the U S  dollar and held gains  while traders in the island nation await Friday s decision from the Bank of Japan when it concludes its latest monetary policy meeting

141147,362662,JBL,3 Reasons Why Jabil Circuit  JBL  Is A Great Value Stock,opinion,Many investors like to look for value in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for value oriented investors  but today let s focus on Jabil Circuit Inc    NYSE JBL   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous reasons why this is the case  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for JBL s status as a solid value stock below Price to Forward Sales for Jabil CircuitOne of the most underrated ratios for value investors is the price forward sales metric  This ratio shows investors how much they are paying for each dollar of revenues generated  In other words  a lower number is better here while a price to sales ratio of 1 means that you are paying one dollar for each dollar in sales With a P S ratio of 0 22  JBL investors are paying 22 cents in stock price for each dollar of revenue generated by the company  Compare this to the industry average of 0 32  and it is safe to say that JBL is undervalued compared to many of its peers on this important metric Price Cash Flow for Jabil Circuit StockAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This reading is preferred by some since it avoids amortization and depreciation concerns and can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business JABIL CIRCUIT PE Ratio  TTM    The P CF ratio for JBL comes in at 3 70  and since investors are generally looking for a reading under 20 here  this is pretty good news  Meanwhile  we should also point out that the industry average for this metric is 6 02  so Jabil Circuit has its peers beat in this regard too JBL Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionThe solid value ratios outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  but we should also note that the earnings estimate revisions have been trending in a positive direction as well  Analysts who follow JBL stock have been raising their estimates for the company lately  meaning that the EPS picture is looking a bit more favorably for Jabil Circuit now Over the past 30 days  1 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 1 estimate has move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as 30 days ago JBL was expected to post earnings of  1 62 per share for the full year though today it looks to have EPS of  1 70 for the full year Bottom LineFor the reasons detailed above  investors shouldn t be surprised to read that we have JBL as a stock with a Value Score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  So if you are a value investor  definitely keep JBL on your short list as this looks to be a stock that is very well positioned for gains in the near term Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-jabil-circuit-(jbl)-is-a-great-value-stock-200156791,200156791
141149,362664,JBL,Coast Your Portfolio Into 2017 With These 5 Momentum Stocks,opinion,"After a calm August followed by a shaky September one has to ponder on the idea that risks and volatility in the financial markets are merely rotational   the old ones may fade only to make place for the new ones 
With S P 500 gaining 5  and Dow Jones gaining 3 2  over the last six months  the nvestment climate can be described as somewhat comforting for most investors  Despite the tenacious Bull Run  a nagging suspicion lingers on  How fast and how hard will volatility hit again 
Factors Driving Markets
A cacophony of global factors   both economic and political   currently signals a tough going for investors  Economic data released recently revealed that the ISM s manufacturing index plummeted to 49 4  in September from 52 6  in August  showing the first signs of decline after a robust six months  The nominal sales data also remains unimpressive  adding to concerns 
Currently  the economy is on shaky grounds  with factors like impressive private consumption  robust labor market and rising real wages being positive drivers  while strong U S  dollar  sore energy market and lower oil prices being spoilsports 
In addition  indecision of Fed with respect to interest rate hikes seems to be testing the mettle of the toughest investors  It seems that other major central banks are following the cue  For instance  Bank of England  European Central Bank and Bank of Japan  are largely keep their rates unaltered 
Furthermore  uncertainty related to the upcoming U S  presidential elections is expected to be one of the major dampeners this year  While market watchers are linking Trump s victory to be beneficial for some sectors  the Clinton clan is linking it to others  The outcome of the presidential election can bring back the wild swings on the bourse 
Hitching the Momentum Ride
Does all this volatility mean sitting on the sidelines and missing out on all the action  Well  clearly the answer should be a clear  resounding  no   as this volatile market has a lot to offer to investors who have the appetite for it  We believe that momentum investing is one of the most successful strategies to churn out profits from volatile markets 
Today  we will discuss a particular strategy that is designed on the philosophy of  buy high and sell higher    an idea that challenges the old school doctrine of  buy low and sell high   It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction  instead of moving against the drift  This strategy disregards the fundamentals of the company  and leverages investors  tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future 
Using the Zacks Style Score to Sift
Here at Zacks  we use our style score system to single out the stocks that can help you beat the market  The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success  Our research shows that stocks with a Momentum Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer the best upside potential in the short term  You can see  
Further  we have refined our search by considering stocks that have gained 5  over the past four weeks and still appear to have plenty of upside left  Further  these companies have been seeing positive analyst interest of late

141151,362666,JBL,5 Best Stocks For A Scary October,opinion,"With the presidential elections just around the corner  the month of October is expected to face heightened turbulence  This month  historically  has earned a formidable reputation of providing dismal returns ahead of elections  while concerns about Deutsche Bank AG   NYSE DB   have rattled the financial markets  Meanwhile  uncertainties surrounding the Fed rate hike coupled with high valuations are expected to aggravate concerns To overcome the market adversities  it will be judicious to invest in stocks that boast strong fundamentals and are less volatile than the broader markets   Election to Spur VolatilityElections traditionally lead to stock market volatility and it won t be any different this time around  According to the Stock Trader s Almanac  which dates back to 1950  the S P 500 averages a decline of 0 7  and the Dow industrials averages a 0 8  drop  The performance of the more volatile indices like the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 is worse  with an average setback of over 2  The head to head between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is quite a close one  Ahead of the first U S  presidential debate  Trump took a two point lead over Clinton  but it was Clinton who held an edge over Trump in the first presidential debate by displaying a better degree of preparedness on matters concerning public policy  defense and tax reform  read more    VIX to RiseThe CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   a gauge of near term investor anxiety  has always risen from the month of September to October  except for 1996  when Bill Clinton handily won the re elections  Thanks to such increasing uncertainty  some of the imminent strategists had already expressed their concerns   Here are some of their comments From JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  strategists led by Dubravko Lakos Bujas   2016 election will likely be a source of heightened volatility in the weeks ahead of November 8th  From David Kostin and colleagues at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Equity market uncertainty typically rises in the month immediately ahead of presidential elections  and we believe the current below average level of uncertainty is unlikely to persist  From Mandy Xu and colleagues at Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Historically  we find that elections have been a meaningful driver of equity volatility  Deutsche Bank Adds to WoesMore uncertainty looms large this month as Deutsche Bank s woes continue to spook investors   The German lender endured questions like whether it was losing the confidence of investors after a handful of hedge funds that clear derivatives through the bank withdrew excess cash and positions  Shares of Deutsche Bank tanked to   only to rebound on Sep 30 and end the week at a gain of 1 4   Reports continued to circulate that the bank may be able to negotiate a less onerous settlement with the Justice Department than the  14 billion figure being discussed earlier  German Chancellor Angela Merkel had already refused to offer state aid to the giant lender Nonetheless  shares of the lender plunged more than 50  this year as investors remain worried about the institution s thin capital cushion  Such a decline affected other European banks  already plagued by Eurozone s weak economy and negative interest rates Fed Rate Hike Dilemma  Stretched ValuationsSeptember jobs data is due on Oct 7  The outcome can also help shape market perception in the coming weeks  A December rate hike is more likely  but  if the jobs data turn out to be mediocre like the August one  it might indicate that the domestic economy is in a tight spot  Lest we forget  a slew of discouraging retail sales reports  pending home sales and manufacturing numbers seem to hint at sluggish growth The market is already in a precarious situation  as most analysts warn that stock market valuations are at elevated levels  This makes the market more vulnerable to a volatile sell off  The S P 500 s forward 12 month P E ratio is currently at around 16 6  way above the 5 year average of over 14 8  It is also worth noting that earnings are not just lackluster  they are negative  Total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to be down 2 8  in the third quarter from the same quarter last year  read more    Torrid Times Ahead  5 Solid PicksAmid such uncertainties  it seems sensible to buy stocks that are fundamentally strong and will continue to do business even in the worst of times  Investors should also build a strategy on low risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns  The best way to go about doing so is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in We have selected five such stocks that boast of a  of  A   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics  Such a score allows you to eliminate the

ve lost all my marbles  Somebody put this guy in a strait jacket  Or  I ve got an even better idea  Take a look at the Russell 2000 chart  The Russell 2000  R2K for short  represents the small caps in the stock market  Small caps historically are more volatile than large cap stocks  If you want to sound fancy you say they are  high beta   They have a tendency to exacerbate moves in the S P 500 to either side  But  while the S P 500 is hitting new all time highs like every other week  the R2K has been locked into a trading range forever  The range between 1082 and 1212 has been a firm floor and ceiling for the index since last November  Since then we ve done all sorts of wiggling and jiggling between the two levels  Efforts to breakout above or below have been convincingly thwarted  Currently we re trading at about 1160 on the R2K  just a shade above the halfway mark between the buoys  The last time buyers came in to support the index was August 1st when traders came and scooped up shares of small caps well ahead of the bottom of the range at 1082  Most of the buying happened above 1107  which is about 25  or so from the bottom of the range  From a technical aspect  this implies a more bullish pattern developing for the R2K  but also there s a chance this rally dies out in the 1180s as the range becomes more compacted ahead of a breakout  Any way you slice it  I m bullish small caps with the S P 500 at all time highs  I have a few names you should be looking at  even with the market as high as it is TriQuint Semiconductor  NASDAQ TQNT   TriQuint designs  develops  manufactures  and markets a broad range of high performance analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for communications markets  The integrated circuits are incorporated into a variety of communications products  including cellular phones  fiber optic telecom equipment  satellite communications systems  high performance data networking products and aerospace applications  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  has surprised earnings estimates to the upside for four quarters in a row  Further  over the last 30 days  three analysts have raised their estimates for the current year and next year  This has pushed consensus up from 31 cents per share for the current year to 51 cents and bounced next year s consensus up from 50 cents to 75 cents  All this has contributed to one heck of a run for the stock  After gaping up to break the  10 mark in February of last year  TQNT has barely paused to take a breath on its ride upwards  A few times the stock traded sideways to touch the 25 day moving average shifted by 5 days  After brief consolidation periods and minor sell offs  TQNT almost always rebounds to head even higher  Recently the stock has formed a bit of a bullish triangle pattern  Stochastics are in overbought condition so you do have to use a bit of caution when jumping on board  However  you can expect to see stochastics like this during a breakout and that s exactly what s happening to TQNT right now  With the spike to a 52 week high intraday today  I d expect to see an attempt at  20 over the coming weeks  Jabil Circuit  NYSE JBL  Jabil Circuit is a worldwide independent provider of electronic manufacturing services  It designs and manufactures electronic circuit board assemblies and systems for major original equipment manufacturers in communications  computer peripherals  personal computer  automotive and consumer products industries  Due to positive earnings revisions turning more than 60 days old  JBL has bumped down to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   however it s in an industry that ranks 3rd or in the Top 1  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The stock  just today  broke out above the previous 52 week high where it had a failed breakout attempt just a few short weeks ago  This momentum stems from an aggressive stop grabber pattern at the 23 6  retracement of the December 18th to June 24th broad move to new highs  This  coupled with a stochastic bullish crossover from an extreme oversold condition has been the technical catalyst  With the old 52 week high firmly in the rearview mirror  you can expect a short run up until the stock inevitably retraces to retest the old high  If you miss the breakout happening now  you can wait for a bit of weakness to jump in and ride this thing higher Bottom Line Yes  we re at all time highs on the S P 500 but that doesn t mean that you should shy away from the stock market  Here I ve given you reasons to step in  be courageous  and buy this market  These two stocks should benefit from a continued rally in the small cap Russell 2000 index ,2014-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-to-buy-at-all-time-highs-223469,223469

141215,362730,JBL,Reviewing January Options like a Rolling Stone,opinion,Once upon a time you dressed so fineYou threw the bums a dime in your prime  didn t you  People d call  say   Beware doll  you re bound to fall You thought they were all kiddin  youYou used to laugh aboutEverybody that was hangin  outNow you don t talk so loudNow you don t seem so proudAbout having to be scrounging for your next meal  How does it feelHow does it feelTo be without a homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone   Like a Rolling Stone Bob Dylan After watching the Republican Debates  I feel like we have  no direction home   I wonder what happened to the days when the President of the United States of America  used to ride on a chrome horse   Somewhere along the way I have discovered that the President isn t  where it s at  after he took from  us  everything  they  could steal   So we are left to  be on  our  own   I recall a day when a Trillion was just a number we studied in school and couldn t imagine how much that was and now we spend 15 of them each year  I try to avoid getting off on a political tangent  so I will stop with saying that the solution seems  like a complete unknown  from anyone I have heard during the early stage of this election  All things considered  we have done well with the options up for review on January 20  2012  so we turn to the markets  Like a rolling stone   In no particular order  Agilent Technologies  Inc   A  was recommended on October 5  2011 as a  bargain  at  31 97  We recommended using Phil Davis s buy write strategy to make the  bargain  even better  Agilent reported 4th quarter earnings on November 16  2011 which beat estimates by  0 03  but they were guided lower  The lower guidance changed the 5 year projected growth rate on earnings from 21  to 15   and the stock is now 20  higher than when we recommended exposure  driving the Forward P E to 11 21  The stock is trading today at  39 on news of a deal with Mitsubishi  The sum of all parts of our trade is that we bought Agilent on October 5  2011 at  31 97  sold the Jan  33 call for  3 65 and sold the Jan  33 put for  4 50  Allowing our trade of Agilent to close on January 20  2012  with our stock called away at  33  will earn us  8 15 in option premium and  1 03 in stock price  called strike is  33  for a net of  9 18 profit  The common thread in Bob Dylan s song is  How does it feel     quite good  The other recommendation on October 5  2011 was a similar buy write exposure to Rockwood Holdings  ROC   focusing in on value and  bargains  at the time  Recall that Rockwood had slid from a high of  62  and we were wanting exposure following upgrades from JP Morgan and Gradient Analytics at  36 19  Rockwood Holdings announced that they will deliver earnings on February 21 with analysts expecting them to earn  0 79 for the quarter  It doesn t appear that we will be exposed to the stock during that announcement because ROC is trading at  43 03  and we recommended selling the Jan  40 call for  3 80 and the Jan  40 put for  7 75  The sum of all parts on this trade nets a tidy profit of  11 55 in option premium and  3 81 in stock price with the stock being called away at  40  I gave some consideration to playing the  rolling stone  card on ROC and rolling our options to February  just ahead of the earnings announcement   but the option premiums have closed sharply since last October and there aren t enough reasons for us not to simply take our  15 31   11 55    3 81  and move on   How does it feel      very good  Radware Ltd   RDWR  was originally recommended for long exposure on November 10  2010  no  that isn t a typo of 2010  at  33 39  and we updated the position on December 7  2010  At that time there were a lot of rumors pushing RDWR around suggesting a buyout price of  47  The idea was that selling a Jan  35 2012 call for  9 45 would eventually be moot  The only thing moot about it today is that we will be able to recognize a  9 45 profit for our time with RDWR  trading today at  31 54  Radware announced today that it will host 4th quarter earnings call on February 1  2012  The analyst expectation is  0 37 share with Zack s intiating coverage with a Buy in the last month  and 1 of 3 analysts raising current and next year estimates  We will want to go back into buy write mode with RDWR following the expiration of our call on January 20  2012  The recommendation is to sell the Mar  31 call   1 95  and Mar  31 put  1 40  to bring in an additional  3 20   How does it feel   on RDWR   Like a rolling stone  as we roll our options  Jabil Circuit Inc   JBL  was originally recommended on January 27  2011 and played the  rolling stone  twice already  Jabil is and has been a  perfect  stock  much like GCI  for using Phil Davis s Buy Write strategy over and over and over  First  let me review the purchase price and trades thus far  and then I will comment on why this stock is ripe to keep as a  rolling stone   Our original recommendation provided us with exposure to JBL at  20 56 and sold the Jun  20 call   1 90  and Jun  20 put   2 40   On June 9  2011  we recommended closing the Jun  20 put   1 70  and rolled to Sept  20 call   1 35  and Sept  20 put    2 10   On September 16  2011 we rolled again closing the Sept  20 put for   2 45  and selling the Jan  20 call   1 35  and Jan  20 put   3 80   There is a fair amount of math to do here but sum of all trades is   20 65  1 90  2 40  1 70  1 35 2 10  2 45  1 35 3 80  a cost basis today of  11 81 or nearly  10 lower than when we acquired the position all while the stock has moved north by less than  1  We will need to spend approximately  1 08 based on today s trading price to close the Jan  20 call this time and roll to Mar  21 call   1 50  and Mar  21 put   1 15  shaving another  1 57 off our cost basis and moving the call and put strike to  21  JBL is still worthy of long exposure based on our normal metrics of looking at 5 year projected earnings growth of 12  at a Forward P E of 7 32 and Operating Cash Flow of  1 02 billion  Free Cash Flow of  505 million    How does it feel   on JBL   Like a rolling stone   China Petroleum   Chemical Corp  SNP  is a stock we have been writing Covered Calls on since recommending exposure on October 17  2010 when we snapped it up at  96 54  and it coincidently reminds me of the October 27  2010 article  Funeral for a friend   After recommending SNP In late 2010 using the covered call strategy  we have rolled  like a rolling stone  5 times  but January 20  2012 will likely be the last  at least for now  A quick recap on this position shows that we sold the Jan 2011  100 call at the time we added long exposure for  4 40  On January 18  2011  we recommended rolling to close the Jan  100 call for  1 95 and selling the Apr 11  100 call for  6 60  Similarly  on April 13  2011  we recommended closing the Apr  100 call for  3 35 and selling the July 11  100 call for  7 00  Each time  we chipped away at the cost basis in SNP while continuing to hold exposure in the stock  On June 30  2011  we played a familiar tune while closing the July call for  2 20 and selling the Oct 11  100 call for  5 50  Shockingly  on October 21  2011  we didn t have to buy the call back to roll and earned the entire  5 50 as SNP traded lower with the rest of the market  Our recommendation was to sell the Jan  12  95 call for  4 70 which will spell the end to our exposure  for now  to SNP as the stock is trading today at  113 36  This is a good time to part ways with SNP  at least for now  as shares may come under pressure from the Battle for China Gas  When the dust settles on this trade  we will have acquired SNP at  96 54 and exited at  95  assuming it is called away next week  while netting  20 50   4 40   1 95  6 60  3 35  7  2 20  5 50  in option premium  We have to account for the loss in stock price of  1 54  but a few nifty dividends received along the way offsets some of that  So once again we ask  How does it feel   on SNP   good  LDK Solar  Inc   LDK  was recommended on January 28  2011  and when I ask  How does it feel   the answer is not good  even lousy  but working on it  We recommended exposure to the solar space and LDK at  12 95  At the time we entered the position  we recommended Phil Davis s Buy Write strategy by selling the Jun 11  13 call   2 09  and selling the Jun 11  13 put   2 11   At the time analysts  were expecting LDK to make a profit of  2 12 for 2011 and an earnings growth rate of 25   By June 9  2011  19 Analysts were still suggesting a profit of  2 46 for 2011  We recommended rolling the options by closing the Jun 11  13 put for a staggering  6 40 and recommended selling the Sep 11  6 put for  0 75 rather than accept delivery of additional shares  The first put didn t work out well for us as we had to recommend repurchasing the Sep 11  6 put for  1 on September 16  2011  I am starting to understand what Bob Dylan meant when he says  Oh you never turn around  to see the frowns  on the jugglers and clowns  when they did  tricks for you  never understood  that it ain t no good  you shouldn t let other people  get their kicks for you  as those same analysts that were projecting  2 46 for 2011 are now projecting   1 03 for 2011 and   1 19 for 2012  Fortunately  the Jan  12  5 put we sold for  2 05 appears like the first bright light in a while on this trade with LDK trading today at  5 12  I am recommending rolling to the Mar  12  5 put at expiration next Friday for  1 08  Again   How does it feel   on LDK   Like a complete unknown   Xyratex Ltd   XRTX   is a horse of a different color which has given us quite a ride since recommending exposure on December 21  2010 at  15 35 and selling the Mar 11  15 call   1 80  and Mar 11  15 put   1 50   In a rare decision for me  we accepted delivery of the  put  shares on March 20  2011 and took a wait and see attitude before recommending any further options believing that the stock would rebound from the lows of  7 58  Sure enough  on January 5  2012  XRTX blew away estimates of  0 33 and delivered  0 77  The stock was on the rise prior to the earnings beat and closed today at  15 64 which puts me in the mood to turn to another trusted friend  covered calls  I recommend selling the Mar  12  15 call for  1 30 to continue working our cost basis down  Our original entry price was  15 35 and put exercise price of  15  but we earned premiums of  3 30   1 80 call and  1 50 put  so before selling this call option our cost basis is  12 98   How does it feel   on XRTX   much better than it did  Assuming nothing changes between now and option expiration date  next Friday  on these trades  we will be freeing up cash in the portfolio to add additional positions  I will post recommendations next weekend and will likely recommend a few buy write positions on stocks in the Sabrient Baker s Dozen 2012  Happy New Year  and I hope I can help you answer  how do you feel   more positively in 2012  Recommendations  Allow Agilent Technologies  A  to be called away at  33 earning call and put premium  Allow Rockwood Holdings  ROC  to be called away at  40 earning call and put premium  Sell to open RDWR Mar  31 call RDWR120317C00031000  at option expiration next Friday Sell to open RDWR Mar  31 put RDWR120317P00031000  at option expiration next Friday

141216,362731,JBL,HUSA Provides The Reason  again  to Take Profits  Option Review March,opinion,I m not a perfect personThere s many things I wish I didn t doBut I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know I ve found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  Houston American Energy Corporation    has been a good hedge for our long positions  Our short interest in HUSA is well documented starting on  at  9 91  HUSA provided us with the opportunity to take a quick  12  gain ahead of their  earnings  report on   Not to be counted out  HUSA bounced on what I would call poor quality earnings and gave us a second chance to short again on  at  10 54  The volatile market of 2010 and a company with a lot of unanswered questions afforded us the opportunity to cover with another  15  profit in just 2 days  on  at  9 35   provided us the chance to say  hello again  to HUSA by shorting at  9 93  Once again  the volatility of HUSA offered us the chance to  take it on the run  on  when we bought to cover  Finally  we recommended a 4th entry into HUSA as a short on  to the back drop of  don t stop believing  at  10 06  One thing to understand is that  earnings quality  stocks can sometimes take months or years to play out  and they often give rise to the feeling that  there s many things I wish I didn t do   However  the good news is that most  earnings quality  issues do eventually play themselves out in the market  and so I have to say before I go  that  the reason is you  HUSA    The company did their best to dance around the issue in their   but the cap on this well was  As a result of these developments  the decision has been made that without the ability to effectively test the lower zones  the most prudent course of action is to plug back the well and to further evaluate the C 7 and C 9 Formations   HUSA had a trading halt mid day Thursday but that didn t stop a near  40  drop below  7  This gives us  a reason to start over new  and recommend closing the 4th position in HUSA with another  20  profit  We have 6 option positions to consider in March and it makes sense to discuss our strategy with 10 trading days left before expiration  Seagate Technology    is pretty much a foregone conclusion that the stock will be called away and the puts expire in our favor  We recommended using the buy write strategy on   In retrospect  buy and hold would have been a more profitable decision which reiterates the  There s many things I wish I didn t do  theory  STX is trading at  27 45 today  but we recommended selling the March  21 call and Mar  21 put for the sum of  2 05  It would appear that the puts will expire and the stock will be called at  21 providing a tidy  10  profit for the 60 day hold  Jabil Circuit  Inc      which has been in the virtual portfolio since   appears to be headed for the same fate  JBL closed today at  25 97  Our most recent  rolling stone  article on  recommended a 4th quarterly roll of the buy write options to a March  21 call and put  Without repeating the history  published In Jan 13 article  of option trades  we have used option trades to lower our cost basis in JBL to  12 89  Therefore  when the stock is called away at  21 on Friday  March 16  2012 we will close the position with a profit of  39  profit  This is a good example of how the buy write strategy and selling time premium can enhance returns on a stock we like for long exposure  Buy and hold on JBL from January 27  2011 would have netted us a  26  profit  Radware  LTD      is an expiring option that we will want to monitor closely over the next 2 weeks  Recall that we originally recommended exposure to RDWR as a long position on  at  33 39  RDWR gives us a perfect example of how options and selling time premium can enhance the returns of a stock we like  The stock closed today at  33 23  so for all intents and purposes  unchanged  However  we collected  1 30 in net premiums on the original buy write and another  9 from selling the Jan 12  35 call on   After expiration in January 2012  we recommended rolling to the March 12  31 call   2 10  and put   1 40   Our cost basis is  19 59 after earning the time premium from options  The company has beat expectations the last 4 quarters on the good side  but the metric of growth versus forward P E isn t what I would like  Therefore  I think it is wise to follow the stock over the next 2 weeks  If it remains over  33  I am likely to recommend letting the put expire and stock be called away at  31 to close out a nice profit  On the other hand  if RDWR drops closer to  31 in the next 2 weeks whereby both options could be rolled for less than   50 cost  then I will recommend rolling to June  I will post my recommendation Thursday  March 15  2012  Xyratex  LTD      has had an amazing run after blowing out earnings in the last quarter  We have had long exposure to XRTX since   entering at  15 39  Through buy write options and the  we have lowered our cost basis to  11 58 while facing the prospect of having the stock called away at  15  Much like RDWR  I would recommend watching XRTX closely in the next 2 weeks  XRTX closed today at  16 67  Unless the stock drifts back closer to  15  my recommendation will be to avoid chasing the option and accepting the call at  15  We can find better GARP stocks at this point to replace XRTX if it gets called away  Western Refining Inc      has worked out just about perfectly based on the scenario laid out on   with arms wide open   At that time  we wanted to gain exposure to WNR and recommended buying the stock at  15 75 and selling the March  16 call   1 35  and March  16 put   1   WNR closed today at  19 05  I will give a recommendation on how to roll this option to June as we get closer to March 16  2012  More than likely  we will allow the put to expire and pocket the  1 in premium and buy back the call to roll to a higher strike call and put in June  Lastly  we have been working our cost basis in LDK Solar Co     down by selling puts since entering the stock with a buy write on   Thus far  LDK also fits the mold of  there s many things I wish I didn t do  but I continue learning   I recommended selling the March  5 put on  which appears at this time to be a good decision  LDK closed today at  5 59 and should expire in 2 weeks allowing us to claim  1 08 in option premiums and roll to the June  5 put for another  1 in premium  So  take the profits on HUSA at the open Monday  and if it ever finds its way back to  10 we will visit shorting HUSA again  and the reason is you  HUSA    Recommendations  Buy to Cover HUSA at the market Monday  March 5  2012 Monitor 6 option positions and I will update recommendation during the next 2 weeks,2012-03-03,Scott

141217,362732,JBL,JCOM Gives Stocks a Bad Name  New Buy Write Option Positions,opinion,Shot through the heart And you re to blame  darling You give love a bad name An angel s smile is what you sell You promise me heaven and then put me through hell Chains of love  got a hold on me When passion s a prison you can t break free You re a loaded gun  yeah There s nowhere to run No one can save me  the damage is done Shot through the heart  and you re to blame You give love a bad name     Before I get into the reasons I believe J2 Global Communications  JCOM   gives love  stocks  a bad name   I want to recap the closing positions on Friday which I posted    In quick summary  Radware Ltd   RDWR  was called away at  31 with a 34  gain since    I posted in the  article the series of option trades recommended to create a 34  gain in a stock which actually traded down from our original purchase price of  33 39  final cost basis  19 59    Seagate Technology  STX  was called away at  21 with a 14  gain since    I never complain about profits  but clearly this is a case where buy and hold would have yielded a higher profit than the option strategy   Jabil Circuit Inc     was called away at  21 with a 39  gain since  on a position that we originally recommended at  20 56  final cost basis of  12 89     Western Refining Inc   WNR  was called away at  16 with a quick 17  gain on the buy write strategy recommended on January 29  2012  final cost basis of  13 40    Xyratex Ltd    was called away at  15 with a 22  gain after being recommended on   final cost basis  11 58    Lastly  we had to spend  0 12 to close the LDK Solar Co    Mar  5 put and sold to open the LDK Jun  5 put for  1 20  March expiration closed 5 positions  and so we have cash to open new positions  long or short   Let me get back to the opening line of this article  which is the first of those positions  JCOM   The Grumpy Old Accountants published an article  which details how many view JCOM as having  promised you heaven and then put you through hell    The company has tried to pass off an accounting error as a change in estimate   The explanation s  offered by the company seem to fail the sniff test of many experienced forensic accountants   If the SEC agrees with Gradient Analytics  which graded the earnings quality of JCOM an  F  on November 21  2011  and others  then JCOM would be forced to restate prior year earnings   Herb Greenberg issued a    on JCOM in November prior to the Q1 announcement   Accounting issues aside  highly competitive pricing in the eFax business has caused a sharp decline since 2007 in revenue per customer for JCOM   The company has used acquisitions to grow revenues  but the core business earnings quality appears to be very suspect    An angel s smile is what you  JCOM  sell  and with the possible accounting errors also overhanging the company  you re  JCOM  to blame   causing me to say  you give love  stocks  a bad name    My recommendation is to enter a short position in JCOM  On the long side we want to get exposure to   which rallied Friday on the economic news   Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold  Inc     is my choice as a proxy for exposure to copper   Based on Friday s closing price of  38 56  we can obtain initial exposure at a forward P E of 7 19   The 18 analysts following FCX anticipate  4 17 in earnings for 2012 and three have upgraded their estimates for the June quarter in the last 30 days   By selling the FCX May  40 call    for approximately  1 46 and selling the FCX May  40 put    for approximately  3 10  we can enter with an anticipated cost basis of  34 and a target of being called away  or rolling to a forward expiration  in May at  40  Western Digital Corp     is the second long position I would like to recommend   The 5 year expected growth rate by the 10 analysts following WDC is 20 09  and we can gain exposure  before using our buy write strategy  at a forward P E of 4 34   That is the kind of relationship between earnings growth to forward P E we like to see  WDC also has  585 million in levered free cash flow  along with  3 92 billion in cash   As always  we want to buy   the number of shares we are willing to own at approximately  38 26  Friday s close    Then by selling the WDC July  40 call  WDC120721C00040000  for approximately  2 80 and selling the WDC July  40 put    for approximately  4 45  we can gain the exposure desired at an anticipated cost basis of  31 01 and a target of being called away  or rolling to a forward expiration  in July for  40  Valassis Communications  Inc     is worth long exposure  as 8 of 9 analysts who follow VCI have raised their 2012 earnings targets in the last 30 days  to  3 11  The forward P E  based on Friday s closing price of  24 01  is 6 8   VCI has a high short float of 16 2   which could provide additional upside if the analysts are correct on their increases in earnings for the coming quarters and year  The options for VCI have good liquidity  and so I recommend entering   the long exposure desired in VCI and selling the VCI June  25 call    for approximately  1 50 and selling the VCI June  25 put    for approximately  2 50  We will have the desired long exposure at an anticipated cost basis of  20 01  with a target of being called away  or rolling to a forward expiration  in June for  25  These 3 long positions  FCX  WDC and VCI  using the buy write strategy and shorting JCOM give us  a loaded gun  again  and we still have one position to add in the short term  Recommendations  Short JCOM at the market  Monday March 19  2012 Buy to open   desired shares FCX at the market  Monday March 19  2012  Sell to open FCX May  40 call at the market  Monday March 19  2012  Sell to open FCX May  40

141222,362737,JBL,September 2012  The Money Printers  Ball,opinion,Shall we review September  It began with a sub par jobs report  The ISM manufacturing report posted its lowest reading in three years  The Chicago Purchasing Manager s Index  PMI  posted its first contraction reading in three years  The Philadelphia and New York Fed surveys both fell   again  The August industrial production report posted a sharp contraction  The August durable goods report was comically low  New home sales fell  pending home sales fell   for the eleventh month in a row  and the European PMI fell deeper into contraction  The transport sector was littered with earnings warnings and shortfalls  from Fedex  FDX  to Norfolk Southern  NSC   and the IYT  Dow Jones Transport Index  fell 2 5  for the month and over 6  for the quarter  Leading indicator Jabil Circuit  JBL  got taken to the woodshed for a 20  drop when it missed on earnings  reported no annual revenue growth and lowered guidance for 2013  Conclusion  The markets rise by 2 5  to a post recovery high  It was all about money printing  European Central Bank  ECB  President Mario Draghi threatened to buy short term sovereign bonds in  unlimited amounts  and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said that the Fed would buy mortgage backed securities  MBS  indefinitely  In other words  crank up the printing presses  Yet the markets faded after the Fed s announcement  back to about where they were before  If it hadn t been for some knee jerk buying Thursday on the wondrous rumor that Spain was going to pass another austerity budget in the midst of its recession  thereby qualifying for possible bond buying and more money printing  we might be back to the price levels of Draghi s  unlimited  day  Several things suggest themselves in the wake of the quarter  The first is that Europe is going to keep getting worse before it gets better  Spain is now facing the Hobbesian choice between an austerity program that risks taking the country into depression   the Bank of Spain warned on Wednesday that output is falling at a  significant pace   even while unemployment is already at 25    and insolvency if it refuses austerity  Greece s economy needs help more than ever  as  warned  Both countries witnessed violent demonstrations during the week  Another reality is that earnings are going to be weak  The only silver lining is that they are universally expected to be weak  so there s a lot of room for upside  The hard part will be trying to ignore lowered guidance from management  A third thing is that for some months now  the market has been living almost exclusively off hopes of more central bank liquidity  Now that the ECB and Fed have announced their programs  the lure of more action is largely gone  In the summer  markets would sometimes rally on bad news because it would bring the Fed back in  Now what  It removes an important prop from the market  One thing that s become evident is the feedback loop between trading robots and High Frequency Trading  HFT  programs  The robots that analyze news flow   no  I m not wearing a tin foil hat  this is real stuff and has big money and bigger computers behind it   are clearly programmed to buy stories and words about easing  liquidity  bond buying and the like  In the words of the Wall Street Journal s  column   right now markets respond more to central banks and government intervention  rather than straight economic signals   The HFT order flow sniffers   computers executing millions of buy and sell orders a minute   act as a kind of accelerant on the robotic  algorithmic  if you prefer  buying  The result is exaggerated price movements on low volume that leaves veteran floor traders scratching their heads  normal hedge fund managers reaching for the antacid and mutual fund managers looking up at the indices  wondering whatever happened to fundamental analysis  As retail investors continue to pull money out of stock market funds  the influence of these little trading tornadoes increases  The rest of the market volume has been disappearing  However  accelerants on the upside can also be accelerants to the downside  Somewhere over the next six weeks or so  we are likely to witness a serious give back in equity prices  As we wrote in  during the week  though  the month is still likely to see a move higher in the first half of October  We have a fake Spanish bailout to look forward to  FOMC minutes to fondle with their pillow talk of infinite easing  and a jobs report that probably won t be any different than recent ones but for one detail  estimates are lower  Ergo  the magic phrase  better than expected  has a good chance to appear on the tape  The cold rain of earnings won t really get going for a couple of weeks  so there could be lots of trading robot buy words between now and then  A reckoning looms for all of this  much like the last big high in October of 2007  Besides the drop in the transports   cheerfully dismissed in  as outdated thinking  the way earnings multiples were dissed during the dot com bubble   you might have noticed that oil is falling this month  Oil goes up when traders believe the economy will pick up  and falls when they don t  It also goes up when traders are convinced that more money printing is going to crush the dollar  It doesn t go up when traders are sufficiently convinced that demand is going to be weak enough to overrule the liquidity  You can always sniff out an equity rally without legs when oil isn t going up with it  and it s been selling off ever since the FOMC announcement  The joke is on the consumer   gasoline prices are still going up  Caveat emptor  The Economic Beat The Chicago National Fed Activity Index led off the week  and while it doesn t get a lot of buzz on the Street  it s a number worth paying some attention  The three month moving average hit its lowest point   0 47  since June of 2011  and that was followed by quite a deceleration into the third quarter of that year  GDP fell from a 2 5  rate to 1 3    It has been negative for six months in a row as the stock market has risen  and when that has happened in the past it has been followed by a downward turn in the market each time  Regional manufacturing surveys were mostly downbeat  not a good sign for the National ISM manufacturing index due out on Monday  Looking at the Fed surveys  the Dallas index fell by   0 9   Kansas City declined from 5 to 2 and Richmond posted a gain of four  ending a series of declines  Although Dallas fell by only a small amount  it should have seen more of a lift from the post Isaac rebound  The report that was disturbing was the Chicago PMI and its result of 49 7  the lowest in three years  Looking at the report in detail  it would appear that business is flat lining  better than falling off  it should be said   something that was signaled last month by the decidedly mixed tone of responder comments  This month s batch of comments looked about the same  so we would guess that there will still be no change  which is what 49 7 amounts to  next month  The concern is the Chicago decline in new orders  47 4 seasonally adjusted  50 0 is neutral   With five weeks to go before the election and three months until the fiscal cliff  it isn t likely that we ll see a national burst of decisiveness from business management  That suggests more weakness ahead  There is a silver lining  Looking at inventories and backlogs in Chicago and elsewhere  it looks like the first quarter of 2013 is lining up once again for another episode of inventory replenishment  I suppose we ll have to listen to a rerun of nonsense about the economy reaching  escape velocity  again that was all the rage back in March and April  Yes  it escaped alright   from 2 0  annualized GDP growth in the first quarter to 1 3  in the second  Thursday s third estimate of GDP  one that might have shaken a less diabetic market  was based principally on downward revisions in exports  consumption and a big drop in fixed non residential investment  a problem that Alan Greenspan drew attention to over the summer  It looks like he was right  Given the weakness in domestic final sales  1 4    the likelihood that exports will remain under pressure from China and Europe and fixed investment under pressure from the fiscal cliff  I d guess that GDP is going to stay the same or weaken in the third quarter  Our best hope is for imports to decline   hardly a sign of prosperity  but it can boost the number  Personal income rose a meager 0 1   the same as July after a downward revision to the latter  The difference was that real disposable income fell by 0 3  in August  The year on year rate in income picked up  but that is due to soft comparisons with last year  Spending did pick up by an expected 0 5   due to the back to school season  higher energy prices  gasoline is up 47 cents a gallon from July  and the many state sales tax holidays during the month  The number that really stood out in this report though  was the drop in real disposable income and the sizable revision to July income  from 0 3  to 0 1    That isn t going to be a tailwind for spending going into the fourth quarter  Employment growth may be slowing  We also wrote in  last week that there s a reasonable chance for a good headline print for next week s jobs report  depending on the seasonal adjustment factors  We based that estimate on the facts that the first two weeks of September  when the data is collected  have seen the lowest number of real claims since November of 2007  the end of the third quarter is always low tide for claims   while the underlying trend of real job growth has been fairly steady all year  The year on year improvement in claims looks like it s running at about the same rate as it s been all year  though  despite the latest adjusted low number  going by past experience  the latter should get about a 5 000 6 000 upward revision next week   To top it all off  the estimate of about 100 000 net hires in September  at this writing  is on the low side  That s the positive side of the ledger  On the negative is that surveys seem to indicate a bit of weakening in hiring intentions  We ve been reading quite a bit about big layoffs and cost reduction programs  mostly in labor  of late  but those probably won t start to hit until January  It may be some bias from manufacturing  low natural gas prices have slowed that sector down while taking coal down as well  which has also suffered from weakening Chinese demand  Perhaps the service sector will make it up in the  eat  drink and get sick sector   last week we heard an NPR participant remark that we ve gone from a service economy to a  servant  economy   ouch    As mentioned above  the durable goods new orders number for August took a spectacular fall   13 2   that was tied to a near goose egg in aircraft  Excluding transportation  the fall was only   1 6    and the business investment category actually rose by 1 1   However  there were downward revisions to July  which was already negative excluding transportation  It s another item that doesn t bode well for quarterly GDP  Housing news was somewhat disappointing  The Case Shiller price index rose 0 4   but that was well short of expectations for something close to 1   The new home sales rate fell from July to August while the number itself was short of expectations  and to top it off pending home sales for September fell  The week saw a slew of downgrades to homebuilder stocks in the wake of the news  The good news was in sentiment surveys  which of course tend to track the stock market  and whose peaks tend to precede downturns  Maybe this time will be different  At any rate  the Conference Board confidence number rose to 70 3  the highest since February  and the University of Michigan sentiment number came in at 78 3  The latter number is slightly more timely than the Conference Board number  which was sampled the day the market skyrocketed on  QE infinity   Next week will bring the once mighty jobs report on Friday   can it regain importance over whispers of monetary easing  Before that  we ll get a look at the two ISM surveys   manufacturing on Monday along with construction spending  and non manufacturing on Wednesday  shortly after the ADP payrolls teaser  Thursday has August factory orders and the latest FOMC minutes  the latter often good for a ridiculous flutter on any words that suggest more money printing  Same store sales for September come out that morning ,2012-09-30,Kevin Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/september-2012:-the-money-printers’-ball-138137,138137
141246,362761,JBL,Back into the Abyss  Now What ,opinion,"The last several weeks have brought a steady flow of small but important improvements in the domestic economy  but investors have shunned risk  keeping the markets spiraling downward     Today  the market was awash with stubborn  steady selling  which sank the S P 500 deep into the 1120 1220 abyss where it has been trapped for three months   This is due to the steadily worsening economic issues in Europe  Asia  and even the U S     In Europe s worst economies  Prime Ministers have resigned or been replaced by new elections In the U S   unfortunately  Congress will not resign and elections won t be held for nearly a year 
Our dysfunctional Congress appears to have failed  yet again  to reach any compromise agreement to increase revenue and reduce spending  Simply put  our congressional Super Committee has refused to put aside political divisions to resolve the standoff over revenue increases versus spending cuts at a time when it is clear  to any sensible person  that both will be required to tame our spiraling debt   It remains to be seen whether some sense of reason might suddenly descend upon our representatives or an executive order can be used by the Administration to bring some order to our powerless government 
Here are the market stats 
 
Market Stats  Last week the markets fell in excess of  3   led by Mid cap Growth stocks that dropped over  4   while Small Cap Value lost a mere  2 67  for the week   Basic Materials dropped a frightening  6 15  last week and another  2  today  leading the sectors off the cliff   Finance was only slightly better  losing  2 5  today after dropping nearly  5  last week   Of some solace is the dollar s continued strength and today s solid Treasury auction  which is unlike the sharply rising yields in Greece  Spain and Italy   Perhaps our improving economic reports might actually overshadow our impotent Congress and the Administration s lack of leadership     What does the market want   LEADERSHIP  From someone   Anyone    Of course  the problems are complex and indeed serious   But an investor has a very difficult time choosing among short term fixed income with little or no yield   Mid  to long term fixed income investments face huge risk from potential yield climbs     Precious metals  They re falling from all time highs to who knows what   Real estate  Those assets may have a bottom sometime in the next 5 to 10 years   Go all short   Sure   Most overvalued stocks are already short 15  to 25  of their float   Cash   When would we jump in     Or maybe       a combination of well valued stocks with earning power and strong balance sheets and a few hedges like the VXX  which rose another 1 7  today     It seems like the latter option is the most prudent  so here are a few ideas for long positions in this freaky market
