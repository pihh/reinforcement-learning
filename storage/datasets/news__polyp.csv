4017,225532,POLYP,Premarket London  Greggs Raises Profit Guidance  Rightmove Loses CFO,news,"Investing com    Here is a summary of regulatory news releases from the London Stock Exchange on Monday  11th November  Please refresh for updates 
FTSE 250 restaurant chain   Greggs    LON GRG  raised its guidance for full year pretax profit  before exceptional charges   without giving much else away  It said trading performance  has continued to be very strong  despite the strengthening comparators seen in 2018    In the six weeks to 9 November 2019  total sales grew by 12 4  and like for like sales in company managed shops increased by 8 3   up from 4  a year earlier  
It noted increased customer visits and and  well controlled  operational costs  
In the year to date  total sales have grown by 13 4 per cent and like for like sales have increased by 9 2 per cent  
Online estate agent   Rightmove    LON RMV  said its chief financial officer Robyn Perriss is to step down as chief financial officer  probably during the second quarter of 2020   She ll stay on until then while the company looks for a successor

Russian focused gold miner   Polymetal    LON POLYP  raised its assessment of gold reserves at its flagship mine Kyzyl by 18  to 8 5 million troy ounces  That equates to 41 7 million tons of ore at an average grade of 6 3 grams a ton  
Just under half of the reserves  4 2 million oz  can be mined in open pit fashion  an upgrade of 37    
The update extends the mine s life by eight years to 2047  and the life of the open pit by five years to 2031 ",2019-11-11,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/premarket-london-greggs-raises-profit-guidance-rightmove-loses-cfo-2017499,2017499
4018,225533,POLYP,Silver Producers Mine Supply Continues To Decline,opinion,"Three of the largest silver producers in the world saw their combined mine supply continue to weaken in the first seven months of 2019   While Mexico and Chile experienced declines in their silver production  Peru was by far the biggest loser  Peru  which is the second largest silver producer in the world  suffered an 11  decline in the country s domestic mine supply Jan Jul 2019 
Even though the decline of silver mine supply at these leading producers isn t impacting the current silver market price currently  it will likely do so as the Fed and central banks lose control of their QE money printing and asset purchase policy  In less than two weeks  the total U S  debt has increased by another COOL  85 billion  With total U S  public debt now at  22 92 trillion  it s only a matter of time  maybe just a few weeks before we reach another record of  23 trillion 
With the global silver mine supply this year to reach an estimated 850 million oz of production  the total value based on the Kitco  16 average for the year would only be  13 6 billion   Thus  the U S  Government has increased the public debt in the past two weeks by more than SIX TIMES the value of the Global silver production this year 




Yes  I do realize that comparing the value of silver to the increase in U S  debt hasn t mattered to the markets  but it will   What will happen with silver  and gold  will be very similar to the investor reaction to ENRON when the market realized that the company was a fraud   And  let s not forget that several top Wall Street analysts  in their glorious  Let s continue to bamboozle investors  fashion  continued to put out BUY recommendations days before ENRON collapsed 
So  the market will continue to be BAMBOOZLED by Wall Street and central banks right up until the time that the GIG IS OVER  This means the time to acquire Gold and Silver physical insurance is likely much wiser to purchase BEFORE than the day AFTER the GIG is up 
Okay  let s look at the Top silver producers decline in silver mine supply Jan Jul 2019 




In the first seven months of the year  Peru s domestic mine supply is down a whopping 278 metric tons  11    while Mexico is down 146 metric tons  4    followed by Chile down 57 metric tons  8    The total decline in silver production from these three countries is 481 metric tons  mt  or 15 5 million oz 

Furthermore   Polymetal  International  LON POLYP   Russia s largest silver producer  which accounted for 58  of the country s total mine supply last year  is down 14  in the first half of 2019   Russia is the fourth largest silver producer in the world  followed by Chile   So  four of the top five silver producers in the world are showing considerable declines in mine supply 

I get a laugh at the analysis put forth by some members of the precious metals community  Trey Reik  a managing member of Bristal Gold Group  was interviewed by Kitco at the October Mining Conference in New York   Here was the summary of Reik s gold analysis 

When it comes to gold s price performance  while monetary policy is an important driver  the long term key force remains the overall debt to gross domestic product  GDP  ratio  this according to Trey Reik  managing member of Bristol Gold Group 

In my view  gold s all about monetary imbalances 

When Reik was asked a question about silver  he stated that he wasn t interested in silver because it was not a monetary metal  and it was likely to see a higher 100 1 Gold Silver ratio going forward    This is the typical reply from a precious metal analyst who believes the world is run by ENERGY TOOTH FAIRIES  

These analysts who state that silver is not a monetary metal fail to realize the ENERGY DYNAMIC that drives the MONETARY SYSTEM won t matter if gold is used to back all the debt   That is their M O  or modus operandi   If we found another 4 5 Saudi Arabia s worth of oil in the world  then what Trey Reik states  makes some sense   However  we haven t found 4 5 Saudi Arabia s worth of oil  as the world s new oil discoveries are at a 70 year low   That is not a good sign  indeed 
Lastly  we got some BIG PROBLEMS ahead with that ENERGY TOOTH FAIRY as U S  shale oil production seems to be struggling to keep production at 7 million barrels per day   There s a lot more interesting stuff coming up that should wake up the DEAD ",2019-10-24,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-producers-mine-supply-continues-to-decline-200477214,200477214

4023,225538,POLYP,Silver Miners ETF Performs Even Better Than Silver,opinion,It s hard to believe that silver was trading at only  4 just 11 years ago  And amazingly it was only 7 years ago that silver had hit  10 for the first time in nearly two decades  Now at over  30 and rising  silver is flexing its muscles as one of the best performing assets of the last decade  There s no arguing that silver s secular bull has been spectacular  Since its 2001 low  silver had soared a staggering 1094  to its 2011 high  And based on its structural fundamentals  silver s bull still likely has plenty of room to run in the years to come  Investors who ve been accumulating this precious metal over the years have obviously fared quite nicely  But there s another silver vehicle that in some cases has fared even better  Silver stocks  leveraged plays on the underlying metal  have had quite the bull market of their own  Though there is no silver stock index that has a long enough history to give us a direct comparable to silver over the course of this bull  the next best comparable is the performance of gold stocks given their tight correlations  And the venerable HUI gold stock index is probably the most conservative metric  the HUI is comprised of the world s largest gold stocks  along with a couple of large silver stocks   Considering their risks  mining stocks should exhibit positive leverage to the metals  And with a bull to date gain of 1664  to its 2011 high  the HUI has indeed easily outperformed its underlying metal   640    And I suspect a primary silver stock index would have gains just as good  if not better  over this time  Thankfully there s a product that has come to market recently that does offer investors some semblance of sector level performance for silver stocks  the Global X Silver Miners ETF  SIL   Global X Funds has been a huge innovator in the ETF realm in recent years  especially when it comes to commodities stocks  Its unique approach gives investors easy access to small commodities sectors and subsectors  And the first of its kind Silver Miners ETF is a godsend to the tiny silver stock sector  SIL was conceived in April 2010  and like all ETFs its goal is to closely mirror the performance of an underlying index  This index is the Solactive Global Silver Miners Index  and it is designed to generally reflect the performance of the silver mining industry  SIL is ultimately comprised of stocks that are actively engaged in some aspect of this industry whether it be mining  refining  or exploration  I see two major benefits to this ETF  and the first is the overall benefit offered to investors  As with most ETFs  SIL is easy to buy  easy to sell  and it even has a relatively liquid options market  SIL s basket of silver stocks also greatly reduces individual company risk  And it even offers geographical diversification  which is a big deal in the mining industry  SIL also opens up the opportunity for institutional investment  Since most individual silver stocks rank too small and or illiquid for institutional guidelines  most institutions couldn t or wouldn t touch them  With the advent of SIL  many can and hopefully will as this ETF grows in popularity  SIL s total assets are currently about  366m   Many folks  especially ETF haters  may look past these obvious investor benefits  But they shouldn t  Since silver stocks are small by market capitalization  thin in population  tend to be illiquid  and are known to be hyper volatile  they can be very intimidating to potential investors who aren t attuned to the industry  I guarantee you that a big chunk of the capital pouring into this ETF wouldn t have found its way to silver stocks otherwise if it didn t exist  The second major benefit of this ETF piggybacks off the first  And that is capital shunting directly into the underlying component mining companies  This may not seem like a big deal  but considering the size of these stocks  any buying is good buying  This increases exposure  liquidity  and ultimately the stock prices in a strong silver environment  Speaking of strong silver environment  this is exactly what investors rely upon in order for silver stocks to move to the upside  And as most folks who are interested in this sector are likely aware  silver is in the midst of a   Since its late June low  silver is up an impressive 32  to its high just last week  This new silver upleg gives us an excellent chance to test the resolve of the SIL ETF  And with a 48  gain since its own low in July not only has SIL kept up with silver  it has indeed provided the positive leverage that is essential to keeping investors interested in these types of stocks  Returns like this over only about two months are certainly attractive  And this will no doubt draw increased attention to silver stocks  And for many of the first timers into this realm  the SIL ETF will be their first destination for capital  These returns of course piqued my own interest  which prompted me to do a little dissecting  It s always prudent to get more intimate with an ETF than just its name  to find out if it truly is the best proxy for a given sector  Even a high level peek can speak volumes  In the table above you ll find a summary of SIL s holdings  ranked by percentage of assets in descending order  In blue are the stock symbols  followed by the market capitalizations in US dollars  and then the stocks  flagship project location s   In total SIL is comprised of 32 component stocks  which is actually a significant portion of the world s population of silver stocks  By our count  there are less than 125 primary silver stocks  explorers  developers  and producers  with listings on the US and Canadian exchanges  And it is well known that these exchanges are host to the vast majority of resource stocks  To put this listing concentration in context  of the 32 SIL holdings all but 5 have primary listings in the US and or Canada  While there are a handful of silver companies that list their stocks exclusively in London  Mexico  Australia  or elsewhere  it is a minority  I d say that SIL s 85  weighting towards US and Canada stocks is a fair representation of the global concentration of silver stocks  Even if we are conservative and say there are 150 primary silver stocks in all the world  this is still an incredibly small number  You d think there d be more companies scouring the planet for this precious metal  especially considering its fortunes over the last decade or so  There are however logical reasons for this phenomenon  the most prevalent being silver s geological nature  Interestingly as measured by revenue  silver is usually a byproduct of polymetallic deposits that hold strong concentrations of either base metals  typically lead and zinc  or gold  For this reason less than one third of total global mined silver production comes from primary silver mines  And because of this  mining companies that explore for and successfully develop primary silver deposits are not as common  Another attribute that comes with primary silver stocks is their generally small size  The simple average market capitalization of the 32 SIL components is only  2 6b  And if I exclude its big four  the average goes way down to  873m  This is definitely small cap territory to say the least  And there are a few main reasons for their pint sized statures  The first reason is simply the lower relative value of primary silver deposits and or operations  In general a large silver deposit contains resources in the neighborhood of 40m ounces  with a very large mining operation producing 4m ounces per year  Compared to gold  at the current 1 to 52 ratio   a large silver deposit is equivalent in value to a moderately sized gold deposit  769k ounces   And a very large silver mining operation is equivalent in value to a small gold mining operation  77k ounces   Another reason for the generally small size of silver stocks as a group is the lack of producers  There is naturally a big drop off in market cap from producer to explorer since there is no guarantee that a deposit will ever be developed into a profitable mine  Amazingly there are less than 30 publically listed primary silver producers in the world  And SIL holds nearly all of them  with three quarters of its components actively mining the shiny white metal  Lastly we can attribute silver stocks  small size to the fact that many of them are woefully undervalued  There are a myriad of fundamental and technical reasons supporting this assertion  But in general this sector is still greatly lacking in the exposure it deserves considering the performance to date and future promise of its underlying asset  As for SIL s percentage of assets  the weightings clearly heavily favor the larger market cap companies  Nowhere in its prospectus can I find a reference to a strict adherence to the conventional weighted average market capitalization formula that most indices employ  but I assume its custodians run some kind of a hybrid formula along those lines judging by the weightings  As you can see  SIL s largest three holdings combine for 36   of its total weighting  Silver Wheaton  SLW  is SIL s largest holding  and it of course lists on both the NYSE and TSX  Known as a streaming company  SLW is somewhat of a hybrid between a royalty company and a producer  I ve long held the stance that its brilliant business model makes it the perfect silver stock  SLW is thus the perfect company to anchor this fund  SIL s next two largest holdings are Mexican based companies that actually don t carry big board listings in the US or Canada  And they have quite an interesting interrelationship  Fresnillo PLC  FRES  listed in London  ranks as the world s largest primary silver producer  with the lion s share of its volume coming from its massive namesake mine  30m  ounces per annum  in Zacatecas  Industrias Pe oles  PE OLES  listed in Mexico  is more of a conglomerate company that sports a broadly diversified portfolio of operations  Pe oles has its hands in a wide variety of metals mining  and also operates a robust downstream business  smelting  refining  marketing  etc    In fact  the only reason Pe oles is considered a silver company is because of its 77  ownership of Fresnillo  Pe oles spun off Fresnillo in 2008   As you go down the list  the next 13 stocks combine to account for 55  of SIL s weighting  And this brings the total weighting of the top half of its holdings to 91   It is quite clear that this ETF adheres to some sort of market cap weighted structure  Of these 13 stocks there s a good mix of mid tier and major producers  along with a high quality junior  On the producer front Pan American Silver  PAAS   Coeur d Alene Mines  CDE   and Hochschild Mining  HOC  listed in London  are among the rare 10m  ounce primary silver producers  And then we see First Majestic Silver  AG   Hecla Mining  HL   Silver Standard  SSRI   Silvercorp  SVM   and Endeavour Silver  EXK  as primary silver miners producing in the neighborhood of 5m to 9m ounces annually  In this group we also find Polymetal International  POLY  listed in London  and McEwen Mining  MUX   And interestingly these companies tout themselves as primary gold producers  POLY does own the third largest primary silver mine in the world  the Dukat mine in Russia   but it is just one spoke on a wheel that is mainly filled with gold mines  And while MUX s current operation in Argentina slightly favors silver over gold measured by revenue  it is in the process of developing a gold centric portfolio  Lastly in this group of 13 is the lone junior  Tahoe Resources  TAHO   Looking at its market cap  you wouldn t think this company was a junior  And it only is in the sense that it hasn t yet produced any silver  But it will soon be a major producer once its massive under development high grade mine in Guatemala achieves commercial production in early 2014  As for SIL s remaining 16 stocks  they cumulatively account for only about 9  of its total assets  These smaller stocks have an average market cap of just under  200m  which ranks in the micro cap category by definition  And of this group 10 are smaller producers and 6 are explorers  Overall after a quick run through of its holdings  I d say that the SIL Silver Miners ETF is a fantastic vehicle for gaining exposure to silver stocks  And I would highly recommend it to investors who are either just getting to know this sector and or have no interest in owning individual stocks  But for investors who do have a bit higher risk tolerance and are willing to learn  individual stock picking is where the real gains are at  If a large basket of stocks heavily weighted to the biggies is capable of positively leveraging silver s performance  imagine what a smaller skillfully selected portfolio of stocks can do  The bottom line is investors who ve been buying the companies that explore for  develop  and mine primary silver deposits have been greatly rewarded over the course of silver s secular bull  And thanks to the recent addition of the SIL Silver Miners ETF  this sector is able to reach investors on an entirely new level  After taking a closer look at SIL  a case can be made that this ETF represents an excellent proxy for this high risk high reward sector  And as a new wave of investors find their way to silver stocks  SIL will be waiting with open arms  But by their nature ETFs have their flaws  And for investors who seek better leverage than what ETFs have to offer  nothing beats a skillfully selected hand picked portfolio of elite silver stocks ,2012-09-30,Scott

4026,225541,POLYP,Graphic  FTSE 100 s changing face   A trip down memory lane,news,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON  Reuters    Marks   Spencer s exit from the FTSE 100  FTSE  underlines how times have changed since the blue chip index was launched in 1984  when it was dominated by British companies including household names like M S  Cadbury and House of Fraser 
Home grown talent is increasingly absent from the FTSE  now valued at  2 4 trillion  as failure to grow domestically or make the cut internationally has seen companies disappear via mergers  demotions  de listing or privatization 
MFI Furniture was among founding members of the index that failed to survive after privately owned IKEA entered the UK market in the 1980s 
British Home Stores and Magnet   Southerns were other big retail names that have either failed or been bought by other companies 
These household brands have been giving way to big corporations that make the bulk of their revenues outside Britain  The most recent FTSE constituents pocket just 29  of their revenue from the UK 
Marks   Spencer  L MKS   which was the fifth most valuable company at the FTSE s inception  now ranks just 111th by market capitalization    too small to qualify 
M S shares have lost about 40  of their value since January 2018 as the British high street stalwart has struggled with competition in clothing and food  particularly online 
Other famous names at the risk of falling through the trap doors soon are Morrison Supermarkets  L MRW   Sainsbury s  L SBRY  and B Q owner  Kingfisher   L KGF   now sitting at the bottom end of the index 
Until recently  M S  Sainsbury s and  Tesco   L TSCO  were some of the 28 original members still in the FTSE 
New joiners in the most recent reshuffle included precious metals mining firm  Polymetal   L POLYP   Hikma  L HIK   a generic drugmaker earning the bulk of its revenue from the United States  and aerospace and defense group  Meggitt   L MGGT  
By sector weightings  banks   financial services  mining and energy stocks now make up nearly 40  of the index  while retail has shrunk to less than 3  from 8  in 1996 
Other major sectors to take a hit in the last two decades were technology  media   telecoms  which together have shrunk to just 7 5  from nearly a quarter in early 2000s 
Here s the sectoral break down of the index since 1996

4027,225542,POLYP,Premarket London  AstraZeneca Scores in China  RBS Swings to 3Q Loss,news,"Investing com    Here are the highlights of Thursday s regulatory releases from the London Stock Exchange  Please refresh for updates 
Pharma group AstraZeneca  LON AZN  raised its sales guidance for the year after reporting a strong third quarter driven by 30  revenue growth in China 
It now expects sales at constant exchange rates to rise  by a low to mid teens percentage   having earlier guided for just over 10    Reported earnings per share fell 15  in constant exchange rates due to a one off gain last year  Stripped of that factor  EPS rose by 38 to  2 61  
The company s cancer drugs performed particularly strongly  with sales rising 67  at constant exchange rates 
 With AstraZeneca growing at pace  our sales guidance has been upgraded for the second consecutive quarter  Another strong performance from our new medicines accompanied impressive results in our key markets  most notably in China  the US and Japan   CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement   The performance reinforces our confidence in delivering sustainable earnings growth  

Royal Bank of Scotland PLC  LON RBS  swung to a net loss of 315 million pounds   409 million  in the third quarter  due mainly to a 900 million pound charge for PPI claims  The bank s core lending and markets businesses also suffered  with NatWest Markets swinging to a loss of 193 million pounds due to falling interest rates around the world  while the net margin on its loan book fell by 5 basis points to 1 97  due to intense competition in the U K  mortgage market 
The PPI charge is at the top end of the range provided for by the bank last month 

Publishing and events group Relx  LON REL  reported underlying revenue growth up 4  in the first nine months of 2019  noting  some improvement in underlying metrics compared to the first half across all four business areas  but still predicting only modest sales growth for the year 


Russian focused gold and silver miner   Polymetal    LON POLYP  said revenue rose 43  to  656 million on the back of higher sales volumes and prices  It also said it s likely to exceed its predicted full year output of 1 55 million ounces by as much as 50 000oz 

Gold equivalent   GE   production grew by 7  year on year to 476 000oz  driven by the new Kyzyl mine  which contributed 94 000oz  
Kyzyl is now producing 11  more concentrate on a steady state basis than originally designed  
The company output mix shifted in favor of gold as silver output from its older Dukat mine declined as planned


Investment platform  AJ Bell   LON AJBA  said customer numbers increased by 17  on the year to 232 066  while total assets under administration rose 13  to 52 3 billion pounds  


Platform customers increased by 34 956 to 218 169  up 19  on the year  Underlying platform inflows were 5 4 billion pounds  just above last year s 5 2 billion  Transfers from defined benefit pensions added a further  0 9 billion 
 



Software group AVEVA  LON AVV  said it achieved low double digit revenue growth on a proforma constant currency basis in the first half 


 This growth reflects a continuation of the strong sales execution seen in Q1  and further benefited from the early renewal of a large EPC contract and a moderate increase in revenue from multi year contracts   the company said in a brief statement
It added that the numbers were boosted by the drop in sterling in the quarter

4028,225543,POLYP,StockBeat  DAX Hits 17 Month High on Hope That Germany Has Hit Bottom,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Has the German economy touched bottom 
The stock market thinks so  the DAX index rose to its highest since May last year Thursday after upbeat earnings from market heavyweights   Daimler    DE DAIGn  and BASF  DE BASFN  gave rise to hopes that the worst of a two way squeeze from Brexit and the U S  China trade war may be over  That helped the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 rise 0 5  to its highest since January last year  It s now less than 1  away from the 400 level 
Meanwhile  the purchasing managers  index for German manufacturing rose moderately in October as uncertainty over Brexit lifted   although the indicator  like the Brexit saga  has provided a few false dawns this year 
Daimler s numbers   the first to be presented by new chief executive Ola Kallenius   were particularly eye catching  the maker of Mercedes Benz cars and vans posted an 8  rise in revenue in the quarter  as sales of its vans rose by over 10  from a year earlier  while car sales rose 8    That offset a weak performance by its truck division  reflecting the sharp slowdown in global business investment this year 
Daimler s shares rose 4 6  to a five month high  They re now up 30  from the six year low that they hit less than two months ago  That s despite another warning on Thursday that there will be further legal costs arising from the Dieselgate scandal  The third quarter numbers were hit by an 870 million euro   970 million  diesel related fine 
Daimler s woes have been partly homegrown but also partly due to external circumstances  The outlook for the next few quarters  for example  will no longer be burdened by distortions from the front loading of vehicle registrations last year to get around new emissions rules in the EU 
However  the global auto market remains depressed  with both the Chinese and U S  markets misfiring  The threat of U S  sanctions on EU car imports remains  even if President Donald Trump s track record of backing down is likely to extend itself as he tries to keep the economy on track in the year leading up to the next presidential elections  Some analysts say that 2018 s sales levels won t be seen again until 2022 
The auto industry  naturally  has a heavy weighting in the DAX  As such  it matters that sentiment towards the sector appears to be turning after a long period of underperformance  In the last month  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  shares have gained 13   while BMW  DE BMWG  has risen 9   Components group Schaeffler  DE SHA p  is up 15   while companies such as materials group Covestro  DE 1COV   which relies on the sector for a large part of its sales  has risen 5

4031,225546,POLYP,Some Observations On Current Global Silver Mine Production ,opinion,In order to satiate the world s growing hunger for silver  a lot of pressure has been placed on its supply chain  And with total annual supply recently exceeding 31k metric tons  1 0b ounces  for the first time ever  the suppliers of this white metal have so far made a valiant effort to meet demand   Silver demand is on the rise for a variety of reasons  in large part due to big increases in investment demand  And this has naturally created a structural imbalance that has spawned a major secular bull market  A bull in silver of course translates to higher prices  And silver s much higher prices have provided ample incentive for the major sources of supply  recycling and mining  to boost output   On the recycling front  silver s higher price   1094  from its 2001 low to its 2011 high  has prompted more folks to recover silver scrap from devices that would normally end up in junk yards  And as a result  we ve seen a 30  increase in scrap supply over the last 10 years  per the latest figures from research and consultancy powerhouse GFMS    The biggest supply increase by volume though is from mine production  Mine production has always been by far silver s largest supply source  in 2011 accounting for about 70   And as you can see in the chart below  the miners have really stepped up their efforts in wresting this metal from the ground  Represented by the blue bars is global mined silver production  in metric tons  over the last ten full years per figures compiled by the U S  Geological Survey  And this USGS data is superimposed  in red  by the annual average daily price of silver   The first thing of note is that in 2002  the first full year of silver s bull  mine production came in at an all time high  And provocatively this 20kt tally capped off an eight year run that saw production rise by an impressive 43 9   This increase was quite unusual considering it occurred in the late stages of silver s preceding secular bear   Though muted amidst this anomalous production increase  the adverse effects of the bear did eventually come to the surface  And after years of neglect on the capex front  the mining industry s deteriorating infrastructure just couldn t support a continued rise in production  Even though the price of silver started mounting a charge  output couldn t respond   Silver mine production was actually down a hefty 6 0  in 2003  and it wouldn t exceed 2002 s output until four years later  But after 2006 s new all time high  mine production was off to the races  Silver s huge price increase had spawned major development in the mining industry  And through 2011 the miners have responded by delivering six consecutive years of production growth   Incredibly since 2003 s low  silver mine production has increased by a massive 26 6   2011 s estimated output of 23 8kt is of course a new all time high  And by raw volume it represents a 5 0kt  161m ounces  increase over 2003  The miners have so far been quite successful in their quest to meet growing demand and capitalize on silver s higher prices   These favorable conditions have of course led to skyrocketing margins for silver miners  So naturally for investors looking to leverage this metal  it serves quite well to own the mining stocks that bring it to market  But is picking silver stocks as simple as pulling from any of the miners contributing to this overall production total  Unfortunately  no   Digging deeper into these production figures  we find that only a small segment of silver s mine production actually offers direct leverage to the metal  And we need look no farther than silver s geology to explain this phenomenon   Interestingly the majority of economic mineral deposits that hold silver tend to be polymetallic in nature  Meaning not only does the ore contain silver  but strong mineralization of base metals and or gold  And more often than not  when measured by revenue silver is not the primary metal  If a mine for example yields a large volume of silver  yet its lead output brings in more revenue  it is considered a primary lead mine  In this case silver would be a lead mining byproduct   Amazingly per GFMS only 29  of silver mine production in 2011 came from primary silver mines  This means that nearly 17kt  540m ounces  of silver came to market as a byproduct of primary lead zinc  gold  or copper mines  And to further demonstrate silver s byproduct nature  GFMS reports that six of the world s top ten largest silver producers are actually not primary silver companies   So for investors looking to own stocks that give them the best exposure to silver  these 6 biggies  KGHM Polska  KGHPF   BHP Billiton  BHP   Goldcorp  GG   Volcan  VOLC   Polymetal  POLY L   and Buenaventura  BVNN MX   and other byproduct silver producers are not going to do the job  And unfortunately it s not as easy as excluding the 71  to find the primary silver companies   In shifting focus to the 29   we need to further filter the pool based on the ownership of the mines  Just because a mine operates as a primary silver mine  doesn t mean it is owned by a company that operates as a primary silver company  Byproduct doesn t have to be at a mine level  it can be at a company level   Take for example BHP Billiton  BHP actually owns the world s largest primary silver mine  Its Cannington mine in Australia is responsible for a whopping 15  of the silver produced from the world s primary silver mines  Yet since silver is only a very small piece of the revenue pie for this global commodities conglomerate  BHP wouldn t make for a legitimate silver stock play  Though Cannington is a primary silver mine  it is considered a byproduct of BHP s greater portfolio   Including Cannington  three of the world s four largest primary silver mines are owned by companies in which silver is not their primary asset  the other two being the Dukat and Uchucchacua mines owned by gold companies Polymetal and Buenaventura   By my estimate about one quarter of the world s primary silver mines are actually owned by non primary silver companies  which means that only about 22  of the world s silver production is actually in play for investors looking to leverage the metal via the miners   The filtration doesn t stop there though  as we must consider the investability of this 22   And to no surprise not all the companies that own these mines sport stock listings that serve the majority of stock investors  Some of these companies are private  and some only list on exchanges that aren t easily accessible  And this takes away a big chunk of the 22    At Zeal our latest round of silver stock research shows that only about 3 3kt  106m ounces  of annual production are in play via stocks that list in the US and Canada  the international hubs for resource stock investing  And provocatively this translates to only 14  of total global silver mine production being available to stock investors looking to leverage the metal with primary silver stocks   Another interesting note is the 29  haven t actually been holding up their end of the bargain on the growth front  GFMS reports a slight decline in primary silver mine production in 2011  mainly due to ore grade issues   This means that the entirety of silver s production growth last year was through increased volume from primary base metals and gold mines   Lastly on the inner workings of this production growth curve is geographical inputs  And there are some fascinating trends in regards to where in the world the silver is coming from  At the top of the list is the bellwether trio of Mexico   1   Peru   2   and China   3   These three silver powerhouses were at the top of the rankings in the beginning of this bull  and they still hold the throne today   And not only do they still hold the throne  Mexico  Peru  and China have each seen huge increases in production over the last decade  Back in 2002 they were collectively responsible for about 40  of the world s mined silver  But thanks to a combined 58  growth in annual production  these countries now account for a whopping 53  of total mined supply   Also in the mix with big growth over the course of silver s bull are Russia and Bolivia  These two countries are now solid top ten producers that collectively account for nearly 12  of the total mined supply   On the flip side we have major producers Australia  the US  and Canada bucking the growth trend  Back in 2002 these three countries combined to account for 24  of the total mined silver supply  Yet thanks to a combined decline in output of 1 1kt to 2011  Australia  the US  and Canada are now only responsible for 16  of the mined supply  This major decrease in output is pitiful during a period when global mine production is soaring higher   As for the geographical breakdown of the primary silver stocks  we find a mixed bag based on geopolitics and geology  At the top there isn t much deviation  with Mexico host to by far the most publicly traded primary silver miners  We also find a healthy amount of these miners in Peru and in the US  But as a result of tough barriers to entry and or the fact that a country s output is dominated by a single or small group of mines  there isn t as much play for investors elsewhere in the world   Overall  mine production has put its pedal to the metal over the course of silver s bull market  Year after year the miners have delivered all time record production  And we can expect a continuation of this trend in 2012   And so long as silver s bull endures  the miners will have a major incentive to continue to grow their output  which will continue to make the primary silver stocks appealing to investors  And though the pool of these stocks is small  they are the best vehicles to leverage this precious metal   The bottom line is global silver mine production has surged to record heights over the course of silver s secular bull  And the impetus for this growth is the dangling carrot of high margins for the miners  This has made investing in silver mining stocks quite attractive over the last decade   But as discovered when digging deeper into silver s production profile  only a small portion of total output is attributable to primary silver stocks  And this definitely limits the choices for investors looking to maximize their leverage to the metal  Thankfully there are still plenty of quality silver stocks that ought to thrive as silver s bull continues to charge forward ,2012-12-02,Scott Wright,https://www.investing.com/analysis/some-observations-on-current-global-silver-mine-production-145785,145785

4034,225549,POLYP,Silver Miners  Q1 16 Fundamentals,opinion,"The world s elite silver miners just finished reporting their operating results from 2016 s first quarter  and they were impressive  This industry continued to drive its costs lower even as silver finally started mean reverting out of mid December s deep secular low  The silver miners are beautifully positioned to enjoy soaring operating profits as silver s young new bull market continues gradually marching higher on balance 
Silver mining is a tough business geologically and economically  Primary silver deposits  those with enough silver to generate over half their revenues when mined  are quite rare  Most of the world s silver ore formed alongside base metals or gold  and their value usually well outweighs silver s  According to the just released World Silver Survey 2016 by the venerable Silver Institute  silver largely remains a byproduct 
Last year production from primary silver mines accounted for just 30  of the global mine supply  Well over 2 3rds of the 886 7m ounces of silver mined in 2015 was simply a byproduct from base metals and gold mining  And as rare as silver heavy deposits supporting primary silver mines are  primary silver miners are even rarer  Most silver mining companies have multiple mines  including non primary silver ones 
This isn t simply due to the geological constraints in finding and developing silver dominant deposits  The cash flows silver mining generates are relatively small compared to other metals  While base metals are far less valuable  they are found in vastly greater quantities  And while gold is much rarer  it is worth radically more than silver  So it s even challenging for miners to derive the majority of their revenues from silver 
In Q1 16  silver averaged just  14 90 per ounce  That s pretty dismal  just 0 9  higher than Q4 15 s  14 77 average which was the worst for any quarter since Q3 09 s  14 72  Meanwhile gold averaged  1185 per ounce in Q1 16  a far superior 7 3  higher than Q4 15 s  1105 trough which was gold s worst quarter since Q4 09 s  1099  These Q1 16 average prices really help highlight silver mining s economics 
A mid sized silver miner might produce 10m ounces annually  which is worth  149m at Q1 s average silver price  Yet a mid sized gold miner producing 300k ounces a year can generate revenues 2 4x higher at  356m  These comparisons hold even with silver s accelerating new bull so far in Q2 16  which has produced much higher average silver prices of  16 64 quarter to date compared to  1255 for gold 
Despite silver s excellent 11 7  increase in average prices so far this quarter  that mid sized silver miner would still only see yearly sales of  166m at these levels  That compares to  376m for that mid sized gold miner  still 2 3x higher  The cash flows silver mining spins off at these low silver prices often aren t sufficient to sustain mid sized mining operations  so elite silver miners have been actively diversifying into gold 
While mining more gold makes the silver miners much stronger financially  it also dilutes their exposure to silver which is the main reason investors buy their stocks  Unfortunately there are effectively no pure silver miners left anymore in the mid tier and major ranks  and very few among the small but super risky silver mining startups  Silver miners  increasing gold operations certainly complicates analyzing them 
Their Q1 16 reports weren t due out until 45 calendar days after quarter end  and as usual these miners generally like to push that legal limit  So this is the first week where comprehensive Q1 16 operating and financial data across the silver mining industry is available  I always like to dig into these quarterly reports to get a handle on how this industry is faring fundamentally  which helps me make investing decisions 
I want to look at the elite silver miners  results  the biggest and best companies out there with the most widely held stocks  And they are all owned by the overwhelmingly dominant silver stock ETF  which is the NYSE SIL Global X Silver Miners ETF  As of this week SIL had  286m in assets  That was a whopping 6 2x larger than its next biggest competitor s mere  46m  the NYSE SLVP iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF 
But since there aren t that many silver miners out there  SIL also includes 9 of SLVP s 10 holdings  As of the middle of this week  this flagship SIL silver stock ETF had 21 holdings  SIL is the leading way for stock investors to invest in silver stocks today  I painstakingly analyzed the top 17 of these component companies  Q1 16 quarterly reports this week  which collectively accounted for 96 0  of SIL s total weighting 
13 of these top silver miners as determined by SIL s managers trade in the US and Canada  and 12 of them had published their quarterly results by the middle of this week  The lone straggler was Silvercorp Metals  which had its fiscal year end on March 31st  Because full year results must be fully audited by a CPA firm before filing  that final fiscal quarter s deadline is extended to 90 days  So there s no Q1 data yet 
The remaining 4 top SIL included silver miners trade in the UK and Mexico  Like much of the world  they report in half year increments instead of quarterly ones  And since most companies have fiscal years matching calendar years  these half year reports usually come after the ends of Q2s and Q4s  So Q1s and Q3s generally have little or no financial data reported  but sometimes production updates are given 
I dug through all available Q1 16 results from these elite top 17 components of SIL and fed a bunch of data into a spreadsheet for comparison  The table below highlights some of the most relevant  Any cell left blank means that particular company didn t report that piece of data  Usually companies  weightings in the top ETFs don t change very much  so I was surprised to see a major reshuffling at the top of SIL 
Because of that 90 day post quarter end filing deadline for quarterly results ending fiscal years  Q4 15 results of these elite silver miners couldn t be analyzed until April  A few weeks ago I published an essay on silver miners  operating results in that critical secular trough quarter  Their actual performance in those miserable silver conditions was an important baseline from which to compare recovery quarters 
Back in mid April Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO  was SIL s largest holding at 12 1  of this ETF s weight  but by this week that had dropped to 10 8   More interestingly Pan American Silver s  NASDAQ PAAS  weighting rocketed from just 5 5  in mid April to the pole position at 12 3  by this week  I can t recall seeing a faster shift in a major ETF s weighting of an elite company  and these ETFs  managers almost never discuss their decision processes 
I suspect this major shift was a gold thing  Tahoe Resources issued new guidance in early April after its acquisition of Lake Shore Gold was completed  It now expects to produce a midpoint of 400k ounces of gold this year along with the previously forecast 19 5m ounces of silver  At prevailing prices near  1250 and  17  this yields gold revenues of  500m this year which are much higher than silver s at  332m 
Mighty Tahoe  which was spun off by Goldcorp  NYSE GG  to create a totally pure primary silver miner operating one of the world s largest silver mines in Guatemala  is now a primary gold producer  Unfortunately  silver revenues running around 40  of total sales for these elite silver miners are pretty common  I calculated the percentage of revenue that each elite SIL company actually generated from silver sales in Q1 16 
The methodology to determine how pure these silver miners are is pretty basic  Their silver production in the first quarter was multiplied by silver s average price  or a company s actual average realized silver price in Q1 if they happened to report it  Then that result was divided by their total revenues  Since silver lagged gold s initial big advance like usual in Q1  I figured that the SIL miners  silver purity would drop 
And that was indeed the case  as is evident in the fifth column below after each company s symbol  the exchange its stock is traded on  its weighting in SIL  and its market capitalization  The average percent of sales generated by actual silver mining in Q1 16 fell to 44 9  from Q4 15 s 47 5   As silver s young new bull continues to outpace gold now that it is underway  I expect this percentage to start rising again 
Silver prices generally rising faster than gold s on balance should help offset these elite silver miners  ongoing diversifications into gold mining  Rather interestingly  the ranks of true primary silver miners which generate over half their revenue from silver actually grew to 7 in Q1 16 from 6 in Q4 15  These majority silver companies  percentages are highlighted below in blue  Hecla Mining  NYSE HL  just joined this club 
For investors logically buying silver stocks because they want leveraged exposure of silver mining operating profits to silver s upside  the greater the fraction of companies  sales derived from silver the better  If a company generates less than a third of its cash flows from silver  I don t think it should even be considered a silver miner  At that point silver is simply a byproduct within the total operations of that company 
SIL s managers ought to jettison the diversified mining conglomerates like Fresnillo  LON FRES   Industrias Penoles  OTC IPOAF   and Polymetal  LON POLYP  no matter how much silver they produce  Their stock prices naturally don t follow silver  SIL would be a radically better investment for silver exposure  really the only reason investors buy it  if companies were only included that generate over 40  of their sales on a trailing twelve month basis from silver 
This rest of the columns in this table focus on the operating fundamentals for the elite silver miners of SIL  This includes Q1 16 s cash costs per ounce produced  all in sustaining costs per ounce  and AISC guidance for full year 2016  After that is cash on hand at the end of Q1  cash generated from operations in Q1  and finally each company s actual Q1 silver and gold production  These silver miners all mine gold too 

Collectively these top 17 SIL silver miners produced 74 5m ounces of silver in Q1  With global silver mine production now running about 221 7m ounces a quarter per that latest Silver Institute report on silver s fundamentals  these major silver miners account for about 34  of world production  But take out those 3 non silver centric conglomerates  and that drops to 41 0m or around 18   Primary silver miners are rare 
Back in Q4 15  many investors questioned the very viability of this industry  By mid December just days before the Fed s first rate hike in 9 5 years  silver slumped to a brutal 6 4 year secular low of  13 69  But as the silver miners  actual Q4 15 operating results later proved  that was never a threat  Q4 15 s average cash costs for the elite silver miners of SIL were just  6 68 per ounce  far below even silver s deep lows 
Cash costs are the acid test measure of what silver price the miners need to break even and cover their ongoing cash operating expenses  These include all direct production costs  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  Silver miners can survive as long as silver prices remain above their cash costs  And in Q1 16  average cash costs fell 10 3  to just  5 99 per ounce 
A big factor in this was the surging gold prices  which resulted in higher byproduct credits to offset silver mining expenses  It s pretty impressive to see cash costs drop so dramatically in a quarter where silver s average price edged just 0 9  higher to  14 90  As long as silver remains above  6  which is impossibly low given its fundamentals today  any talk of silver miners might not being able to survive is foolish 
But cash costs are misleading  as it takes far more expenditures to run a silver mining company as a going concern  All that silver mined is constantly depleting deposits  so new ones have to be found and developed to maintain production levels  And old exhausted mines have to be reclaimed  So in June 2013 the World Gold Council released the far superior all in sustaining cost metric to measure mining costs 
All in sustaining costs include everything necessary to maintain and replenish silver mining operations at current production levels  This includes all direct cash costs of mining silver  along with all corporate level administration that always should ve been included in cash costs  But AISC go far beyond that to encompass the entire mining cycle  making them a far more realistic representation of true silver mining costs 
They also include exploration for new silver to mine  the enormous mine development and construction expenses necessary to bring new mines online  remediation  and reclamation  As long as prevailing silver prices remain above all in sustaining costs  silver miners can continue to produce at current levels indefinitely  And rather impressively they plunged dramatically in Q1 16 among the elite SIL silver miners 
Their average AISC of just  10 28 per ounce were 21 8  lower than Q4 15 s  13 14  That s amazing  leading to soaring operating profits for these elite silver miners in Q1 16  In the fourth quarter  silver s  14 77 average less the  13 14 AISC average drove silver mining operating margins of just  1 63 per ounce  That s tight  too low for comfort for an industry that has to contend with silver s wild price volatility 
But in the first quarter   14 90 average silver less those much lower  10 28 AISC led to vastly healthier operating margins of  4 62 per ounce  That was a mind boggling 183  higher  This revelation ought to be the final nail in the coffin for the idea that silver stocks  enormous gains so far this year haven t been fundamentally justified  Just the opposite is true  soaring operating profits righteously supported soaring stock prices 
Unfortunately the silver miners themselves don t expect Q1 16 s low AISC to persist  as their average AISC projection for all of 2016 is much higher at  12 79  But I suspect this year s actual AISC will come in much lower than those forecasts  The silver miners made their 2016 guidances way back in early January before gold and silver started powering higher  So those projections assumed very low prices all year 
A great example is First Majestic Silver  the purest major silver miner in the world today with 69 5  of its first quarter revenue from silver  It forecast its full year 2016 guidance for AISC back in mid January  and assumed silver and gold averaging just  14 and  1000 this year  As gold s new bull continues to power higher  rising byproduct credits for gold will lower silver mining costs far more than widely anticipated 
In addition back in January when 2016 outlooks were calculated  investors remained very worried about this industry s survivability so they were overwhelmingly focused on costs  The management teams at the silver miners have big incentives to overestimate cost projections to ensure they can beat them later  So actual AISC in 2016 are likely to be considerably less than the conservative inflated estimates published 
But even if this industry really does have AISC up near  13  the potential growth in operating profits as silver inevitably mean reverts higher is still massive  Remember that silver prices like 2015 s were a total anomaly driven by the Fed s stock market levitation crushing demand for alternative investments led by gold and silver  Silver s average prices in 2014  2013  and 2012 were way up at  19 05   23 80  and  31 19 
So even at  12 79 AISC for this industry  the potential operating profits soar to  6 26   11 01  and  18 40 per ounce as silver mean reverts back to normal levels from recent years as gross market distortions from the Fed s machinations gradually unwind  Those represent profits growth of 36   138   and 298  even at much higher AISC on mere 28   60   and 109  uplegs in silver from Q1 16 s average price level 
Naturally Q1 16 s surging operating profits for silver mining fed strong operating cash flows for most of these elite silver miners  helping maintain hefty cash treasuries even after Q1 s positive silver price action encouraged these companies to start spending on expansion again  The silver miners continued to generate impressive cash flows from operations even while silver s average price stayed near Q4 15 s trough 
So even though silver didn t do much in the first quarter as its new bull market lagged gold s  the silver miners  fundamentals improved considerably  Higher gold prices generated higher byproduct credits for the elite silver miners  lowering their costs  And that trend is going to continue  At a  1255 average so far in the second quarter  gold is up another 5 9  at this point  So silver mining costs should keep falling 
On top of that  silver s average price so far this quarter at  16 64 is a huge 11 7  higher than its average level in the first quarter  Much higher prevailing selling prices combined with costs still trending lower should make for amazing silver mining profitability in Q2 16  We won t know for sure until 3 months from this week when those operating results are fully filed  but the outlook is very bullish halfway through Q2 
So silver miners  upside from here remains vast  in terms of both profits and stock prices  Investors can take advantage of any silver weakness to buy aggressively  as this young mean reversion silver bull is likely to run for years  The coming massive gains in silver stocks can certainly be ridden through this leading SIL ETF  which indeed contains the world s biggest and best silver miners  But SIL has problems 
SIL s managers have really diluted their ETF s upside to silver by including those mining conglomerates that derive the great majority of their revenues from metals other than silver  And though SIL s holdings have to be generally weighted by market capitalization  it takes much bigger capital inflows to boost a larger silver miner than a smaller one  And the biggest silver miners are increasingly diversifying with gold 
So SIL s silver bull market performance is going to seriously lag that of the best of the elite silver miners  An expertly handpicked portfolio only including the companies with superior fundamentals leveraged to silver is going to trounce the silver stock ETFs  gains  So investors willing to do their homework and buy individual stocks instead of settling with the leading silver stock ETFs are going to enjoy big outperformance 
The bottom line is the world s elite major silver miners enjoyed a very strong first quarter in fundamental terms  Even while silver continued to languish near secular lows  silver mining costs fell sharply as gold rallied and boosted byproduct credits  This led to massive growth in silver mining operating profits in Q1 16  more than justifying the powerful surges the silver mining stocks have enjoyed in recent months 
And this explosive silver mining profits growth is likely only starting  As gold and silver continue their mean reversions higher on balance in the coming years  the fundamentals of silver mining will improve dramatically  Stable or even lower costs due to higher gold byproduct credits combined with far higher selling prices will create a fundamental nirvana for the silver miners  Their stocks still have enormous upside ",2016-05-22,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-miners’-q1’16-fundamentals-200131338,200131338
4035,225550,POLYP,Silver Miners  Q3 16 Fundamentals  Strong And Bullish,opinion,"The silver miners recently finished reporting their third quarter results  offering a hard fundamental look into this sector  This reality check is valuable given the fierce winds of bearish sentiment buffeting silver stocks in recent months  Despite their huge correction  the elite silver miners  fundamentals remain strong  They are producing at costs far below prevailing silver levels  with profits poised to soar as silver recovers 
Silver mining is a tough business both geologically and economically  Primary silver deposits  those with enough silver to generate over half their revenues when mined  are quite rare  Most of the world s silver ore formed alongside base metals or gold  and their value usually well outweighs silver s  According to the venerable Silver Institute  only 30  of 2015 s global mined supply came from primary silver mines 
Well over 2 3rds of the 886 7m ounces mined last year was simply a byproduct of base metals and gold mining  And as scarce as silver heavy deposits supporting primary silver mines are  primary silver miners are even rarer  Since silver is so much less valuable than gold  most silver miners need multiple mines  And these often include non primary silver ones  usually gold  to bolster the lower silver mining cash flows 
So the universe of major silver miners is pretty small  The definitive list of these companies to analyze comes from the most popular silver stock investment vehicle  the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   SIL dominates the silver stock ETF space  with net assets running 4 8x its next largest competitor s  Since ETF investing is becoming the new norm  inclusion in SIL is a major boon for silver mining companies 
While there aren t a ton of silver miners to pick from  major ETF inclusion shows silver stocks have been vetted by elite analysts  It also ensures fund capital flowing into leading silver stock ETFs benefits their components  The ETF managers shunt excess differential buying pressure on their shares directly into the underlying component silver miners held by these ETFs  bidding their individual stock prices higher 
As of mid November when silver miners finished reporting their Q3 results  SIL included 24 major  silver miners   This term is used somewhat loosely  as SIL includes plenty of companies that simply can t be described as primary silver miners  Most generate well under half their revenues from silver  greatly limiting their stocks  upside to silver price increases  One is even a gold miner that doesn t report any silver production 
I ve been a silver stock investor and speculator for decades  and my biggest reservation about SIL is its heavy weighting of metals other than silver  When traders buy a  Silver Miners ETF  which is what SIL advertises itself as  they expect to get silver miners with natural upside leverage to silver gains  While pure silver miners are nonexistent due to the geology and economics of silver mining  SIL could do better 
The greater the percentage of revenues any miner derives from silver  naturally the higher its silver price exposure  If a company only earns 20   30   or even 40  of its sales from silver mining  it s definitely not a primary silver miner  Technically that designation should just apply to miners deriving at least half of their revenues from silver production  SIL s managers could build a far superior ETF if they stuck to that rule 
This leading silver stock ETF has long been dominated by primary gold miners and even worse mining conglomerates  Because these non primary silver miners generate only relatively minor fractions of their sales from silver  their stock prices aren t very responsive to silver price moves  SIL shareholders would be far better served by replacing these inappropriate components with smaller primary silver miners 
Nevertheless SIL is what we ve got  so I ve spent recent weeks digging into the Q3 16 10 Q reports filed by this ETF s top 17 components  That number was chosen because that many stocks fit neatly into the table below  But as these silver miners command fully 95 5  of SIL s weighting  they are essentially all that matters  Every quarter I collect a bunch of key data for each  and feed it into a spreadsheet for analysis 
Some of that data made it into the following table  If a field is blank  the company didn t report that data for Q3  SIL includes foreign miners trading in Mexico and the UK  where publicly traded companies are only required to report in half year increments instead of quarterly  So they generally don t release any detailed financial information for Q1s and Q3s  They do tend to report on production though  which is helpful 
The first couple columns show each SIL component s symbol and weighting in SIL as of the middle of November when Q3 reporting finished  If you can t find a symbol here in the States  it is a listing from a company s primary foreign stock exchange  That s followed by each company s Q3 silver production  along with its quarter on quarter change from Q2  That s probably more relevant than year over year today 
With a major new silver bull market underway in 2016  this year has proved radically different for silver miners than last year which was mired deep in a bear market  Thus traditional YoY comparisons are so distorted that sequential QoQ ones make more sense today  Bull years don t compare well with bear years and vice versa  Once silver s young bull is a couple years old  then we can switch back to YoY analysis 
Q3 16 silver production is followed by gold production  Every single top silver miner included in SIL also produces significant if not large amounts of gold  While gold stabilizes silver miners  cash flows  it also retards their stocks  sensitivity to silver itself  Silver stock investors and speculators need to know how pure silver miners really are  So I included another column showing each SIL component s percentage of silver 
This is mostly calculated by taking a company s Q3 silver production  multiplying it by the average silver price in Q3  and dividing that number by the company s total quarterly sales  In a couple cases where miners didn t report Q3 revenues  I approximated them by adding the silver sales to gold sales based on quarterly production and Q3 s average gold price  Either way  it reveals how focused on silver these companies are 
That s followed by cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce of silver produced  They reveal just how profitable silver miners are and how easily they can weather silver corrections  Finally operating cash flows generated in Q3 are shown  which are the best proxy for how silver miners are currently faring  Some of the elite silver miners included in SIL enjoyed amazing quarterly gains in operating profitability 

Compared to everything else including gold  silver is a tiny market  The world authorities on supply and demand in each are the World Gold Council and Silver Institute  Using their respective numbers on global demand last year  world silver demand was worth just  13 9b compared to  162 0b for gold  With silver s market only about 1 12th the size of gold s  there is a lot less interest in and data available on silver 
Together these top 17 SIL components produced 76 2m ounces of silver in Q3  Annualize that  and it equates to 304 8m or about 34  of 2015 s global silver mine production  But that s misleading too  as the largest silver miners included in SIL definitely aren t primary silver miners  The top 3 in Q3 were led by Mexican mining conglomerates Industrias Penoles Sab De CV  OTC IPOAF  and Fresnillo  LON FRES   closely followed by the UK s Polymetal Intl Plc  LON POLYP  
Despite their huge absolute silver production  silver is just a minor overall byproduct for Penoles and Polymetal  Their silver production in Q3 was responsible for just 26  and 30  of their total revenues  Neither should be included in SIL  because their small silver percentages render their stock prices very unresponsive to silver  Fresnillo didn t provide enough data to calculate for Q3  but in Q2 it ran a respectable 49  
Now you could definitely argue that companies deriving over 40  of their revenues from silver qualify as silver miners  but anything under that seems pretty questionable  Investors buy silver stock ETFs solely because they want mining profits leveraged to silver price upside  SIL s managers really ought to take that into consideration  Including so many non primary miners really dilutes SIL s usefulness to investors 
SIL s 9th largest component in mid November  Alamos Gold Inc  TO AGI   actually reports zero silver production  It should be kicked out in favor of the smaller silver miners that didn t make the top 17  Two other SIL components  Klondex Mines Ltd   TO KDX  and McEwen Mining Inc   TO MUX   produce so little silver that they don t even report silver costs  SIL really needs to establish at least a 40  silver threshold to live up to its billing as  Silver Miners ETF  
Interestingly SIL s top 17 component companies actually saw silver production fall 2 1  QoQ  which is fairly steep  But this entire sequential drop came from sharp production declines in those big Mexican mining conglomerates Penoles and Fresnillo  Without them  the other top 15 SIL component companies actually saw silver production grow 1 3  QoQ  But gold production grew even more  diluting silver percentages 
The average QoQ growth rate in these elite SIL components  silver production ran just 1 5  in Q3  way behind their average 8 7  gold production growth  That helped drive their average percentage of sales generated by silver down from 45 3  in Q2 to 42 8  in Q3  On the bright side  SIL s top 17 companies still included 6 that were definitely primary silver miners with 50   of their revenues derived from silver 
Their silver percentages are highlighted in blue in this table  Investors looking for pure silver miners with profits and therefore stock prices heavily levered to silver would do far better owning some combination of these individual stocks rather than SIL  A common problem among all sector ETFs is the upside of the best stocks they hold is retarded by the lower performances from laggard peers  reducing gains 
That s why I ve always preferred handpicking the best individual stocks to own in a sector instead of settling for an ETF s over diversified holdings  While ETFs like SIL usually contain the best a sector has to offer  they are also burdened with many underperforming companies in a somewhat misguided quest for diversification  While diversification indeed reduces risk  it also reduces reward  It is a double edged sword 
Understanding how the elite silver miners fared fundamentally in Q3 requires looking at their costs  The classic way to measure these is cash costs per ounce  They include all direct production costs of mining silver  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  They are the acid test measure of silver miner survivability  revealing silver prices necessary to keep the doors open 
In Q3 16  the top 17 SIL component stocks that reported silver cash costs averaged  5 63  That proved a steep 5 8  QoQ jump from Q2 s  5 32  I suspect this was partially due to Q3 s sharply higher average silver prices  They averaged  19 55 last quarter  a whopping 16 4  higher than Q2 s  16 79  That was silver s best quarter in a couple years  since Q3 14  That gave silver miners some breathing room on grades 
Silver deposits certainly aren t homogeneous  with different areas in the same ore bodies having major variations in silver mineralization  Miners often have to dig through lower grade ore to get to higher grade ore underneath  They can sometimes alter their mining plans to take advantage of higher prices by mixing in lower grade ore that has to be eventually mined anyway with higher grade ore  raising costs 
Since the throughput of mines  mills which process the ore is essentially fixed  lower grade ore results in lower quarterly production  That spreads the big fixed costs of mining across fewer ounces  pushing up per ounce costs  It is not clear that s what actually happened in Q3  as most of the elite silver miners had higher quarterly silver production than Q2  But higher silver prices generally facilitate higher costs 
That happened to a lesser extent in all in sustaining costs too  a far superior cost measure introduced by the World Gold Council in June 2013  AISC give investors a much better understanding of what it actually costs to maintain a silver mine as an ongoing concern  They include all direct cash costs  but then add on everything else necessary to maintain and replenish operations at current silver production levels 
These additional expenses include exploration for new silver to mine to replace depleting deposits  mine development and construction expenses  remediation  and mine reclamation  They also include the corporate level administrative expenses necessary to oversee silver mines  All in sustaining costs are the most important silver mining cost metric by far for investors  revealing miners  true operating profitability 
In Q3 these top 17 SIL companies which reported AISC averaged an impressive  10 13 per ounce  As long as the silver price stays above all in sustaining cost levels  the silver miners can operate indefinitely  This shows how overdone the bearish silver stock psychology has been since the election  with silver s lowest price seen in Q4 still way up at  16 36  These are still very profitable levels for elite major silver miners 
Q3 s AISC among these SIL miners rose a modest 0 8  from Q2 16 s  10 05  much less than the 5 8  QoQ jump in cash costs  The fact the silver miners held the line on all important AISC despite sharply higher silver prices is very impressive  That helped generate big operating profitability  On average the elite silver miners were earning  9 42 per ounce in profits with silver s  19 55 average price seen in Q3 
This was a whopping 39 8  higher than the  6 74 margin earned in Q2 when silver averaged  16 79  nicely leveraging the 16 4  jump in average silver prices quarter on quarter  Silver miners  big inherent profits leverage to silver is the primary reason investors want to own these stocks  The more of any miner s sales are driven by silver  the greater its profits leverage to the white metal and thus the bigger its stock s upside 
These strong margins naturally fed big growth in cash flows generated from operations  the best read on current operating profitability  On average the top 17 SIL component silver miners that reported financial results in Q3 saw strong 19 6  QoQ operating cash flows growth  This is very impressive  certainly way up among the best sectors in all the stock markets  Silver stock fundamentals supported surging prices 
Because of the half year reporting by foreign silver miners  a straight comparison of the total operating cash flows of these top 17 SIL components isn t righteous  But as Polymetal and Hochschild didn t break out Q2 16 operating cash flows in time for my last analysis on silver stocks either  we only have to exclude Fresnillo  It reported Q2 16 operating cash flows as part of half year results  but didn t report Q3 s 
Without Fresnillo  these top SIL component companies collectively generated  1577m in operating cash flows in Q3  This was 30 2  higher than Q2 16 s total ex Fresnillo  Seeing an entire industry s cash flows generated from operations surge by nearly a third sequentially in a single quarter is amazing  This even beat the major gold miners  gains  showing why investors flock to silver stocks during silver bulls 
On an actual accounting profits basis  which isn t shown in this table  SIL s top 17 silver miners ex Fresnillo earned  382m in Q3 compared to  301m in Q2  That is hefty 26 9  QoQ growth in earnings  Can you imagine Wall Street beating down the doors to flood into any other sector where something like this occurred  The fundamental improvement in silver miners this year has been nothing short of enormous 
But today silver stock investors and speculators are ignoring the miners  strong Q3 results to get caught up in the bearish prevailing sentiment  Silver has been hit hard in Q4 due to heavy gold futures selling in early October and then again after early November s election  So far in Q4  silver has only averaged  17 59  That s down 10 0  from Q3 s  19 55  Does the fundamental impact justify the sharp silver stock selloff 
Let s conservatively assume that silver doesn t bounce even though a big rebound higher is overdue  so Q4 to date s average silver price will hold until year end  If the silver miners can maintain Q3 s  10 13 AISC  that yields profit margins of  7 46 per ounce  While 20 8  lower than Q3 s  9 42  that still leaves silver mining very profitable  The sharp drops in silver stock prices in recent months have dwarfed that impact 
As measured by SIL  the silver stocks peaked in mid August  Since then  SIL has plunged 36 6  at worst  And that significantly understates recent months  downside in primary silver miners  since SIL s higher weightings are commanded by non primary silver producers  So it s definitely safe to say that the recent plunge in silver stock prices is nearly double the probable fundamental impact of Q4 s lower silver levels 
Thus the recent silver stock correction is wildly overdone compared to underlying fundamentals  Like usual when sentiment swings against silver stocks  investors and speculators have gotten caught up in the popular bearishness and forgotten about fundamental reality  The silver miners  strong Q3 results are a big wake up call  The silver miners  fundamentals have strengthened dramatically on silver s new bull 
And that is far from over  The post election silver plunge was driven by heavy gold futures selling which sucked silver in  But that extreme gold selling was anomalous and will soon reverse  Sooner or later the overvalued stock markets  euphoria at the prospects of fiscal stimulus will be shattered by the hard realities of actually getting it done  As stock markets inevitably roll over  gold and silver will catch major bids 
Once undervalued silver starts powering higher again  capital will flood back into the beaten down silver stocks catapulting their prices higher  The silver miners  operating profitability improves massively during silver bulls  so their huge silver stock upside is totally justified fundamentally  The anomalous post election silver stock plunge is an incredible buy low opportunity on excessively bearish psychology 
The bottom line is the major silver miners  recently reported Q3 16 fundamentals were incredibly strong and bullish  Stable all in sustaining costs combined with sharply higher silver prices drove explosive growth in operating cash flows and accounting profitability  The fundamental transformation the silver stocks have undergone in 2016 has been amazing  and it is only starting as silver s new bull remains young 
But unfortunately most investors and speculators today aren t paying attention to the silver miners  strong fundamentals  Instead they are all wrapped up in the fearful prevailing sentiment  That s a big mistake as always  While silver mining operating profitability will decrease in Q4 if silver prices remain low  that will be short lived before silver s bull resumes  Higher silver will fuel far higher silver stock levels ",2016-11-27,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/silver-miners’-q3’16-fundamentals-200166720,200166720

4058,225573,POLYP,StockBeat  Gold Miners Get Their Day in the Sun,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    Gold mining stocks are finally getting their day in the sun 
The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners  NASDAQ RING  ETF  which we ll take as a rough proxy for the sector  has hit a three year high this week  tracking the surge in world bullion prices  It s now up 28  since the end of May alone  Bullion  despite hitting a six year high this morning  is up only 11  in the same timeframe 
Part of the reason is catch up  gold itself never fell out of favor with global investors to the same extent that gold mining companies have done in the past three years  But while gold is a relatively straightforward investment that is priced off fairly transparent developments in monetary policy  jewelry demand and the asset management policies of central banks  each company has its own operational and governance risks  often complicated by political risk in the jurisdictions where they operate 
The problems are illustrated by the woes of U K  listed blue chip Acacia Mining  LON ACAA   which was spun off from Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD  in 2010 and which mines mainly in Tanzania  On the face of it  the company has a fine resource base and access to all the expertise of its parent company  However  it s been unable to export gold bearing ore from Tanzania for two years due to a dispute with the government 
Barrick s attempts to solve the issue   by offering to buy out minority shareholders and by negotiating directly with Tanzania on Acacia s behalf   appear to have made the situation even worse  Acacia issued a 5 000 word statement attacking its parent on Monday  blaming it for its troubles with the government and accusing it of trying to buy back its asset on the cheap 
That partly explains why Acacia is up only 3  this year  although it s up 3 3  this morning  helped by perceptions that it is still cheap  By contrast  the largely scandal free Harmony Gold Mining  NYSE HMY   which operates largely in South Africa  is up 25   Likewise  Russian based miners  Petropavlovsk   LON POG  and  Polymetal   LON POLYP    despite past incidents with minority shareholders   are up 56  and 19   respectively  profiting from a lull in the hostile rhetoric coming out of the U S  toward their home country 
The market applies sharp discounts miners  resource bases   Acacia s market value is  983 million  while just its proven and probable gold reserves are worth over  7 billion at current prices  and it has hundreds of millions of dollars more in silver and copper by product on its books  Miners with more speculative projects can trade even more cheaply  That means that the upside for investors can be enormous  However  there are reasons why gold itself is considered the safe haven  rather than the companies that produce it ",2019-06-25,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-gold-miners-get-their-day-in-the-sun-1906585,1906585
