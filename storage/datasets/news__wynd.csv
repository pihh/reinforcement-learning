10897,232412,WYND,5 Stocks To Ride Record Breaking Independence Day Travel,opinion,A record breaking number of Americans will be traveling away from home to celebrate Independence Day this year  The surge in travel count will likely be backed by cheaper gas prices  low rate of unemployment and robust consumer outlays  This calls for investing in the travel space Jul 4 to See Record TravelAccording to a forecast from auto club AAA  a record number of travelers are projected to travel 50 miles or more  A total of almost 49 million travelers are expected to take a trip this Independence Day  reflecting an increase of 4 1  from last year  This will mark the most travelled Independence Day since AAA started tracking numbers Almost 41 4 million travelers are expected to drive  showing an increase of 4 3  over last year s Independence Day  Travel by cruises  trains and buses are expected to increase 0 6  to 3 55 million  And nearly 3 96 million leisure travelers will take to the skies  which is 5 3  higher than the year ago level Busy Summer Air Travel SeasonIndependence Day travel is poised to be the busiest for holidaymakers  adding to the already lively summer air travel season  The industry trade organization  Airlines for America  A4A   recently announced that a record 257 4 million passengers are anticipated to fly this summer  up 3 4  from 248 8 million commuters last summer  which was a record high What s more  on average  a solid 2 8 million Americans will be flying every day  especially from Jun 1 to Aug 31  And that is almost 93 000 more per day  compared to the same time frame last year  By the way  at the peak of travel period  between Jul 20 and Aug 10  it s expected that nearly 3 million people will be flying on a daily basis This year will in fact mark the 10th successive year of an increase in passenger count during summer  And to handle the higher demand  carriers have added nearly 111 000 seats per day than a year ago  Such high supply is expected due to stuffing more seats in existing planes as well as expanding the capacity of new commercial fleet What s Driving Travel This Independence Day Lower gas prices have been a key catalyst  The national average price for a gallon of gas stands at  2 66  which is 19 cents less than this time last year  In fact  AAA gas price expert Jeanette Casselano added that  gas prices are  on average  17 cents cheaper than Memorial Day weekend   Lower gas prices  thus  no doubt will be a major contributing factor toward the increase in road travelers this Independence Day In addition to lower gas prices  strong economic fundamentals are encouraging more Americans to travel this Independence Day  Consumer outlays are off to a firm start of late  The pickup in consumer spending is mostly due to steady wages gain and unemployment rate remaining at the lowest level in half a century  The average wage paid to American workers went up 6 cents to  27 83 an hour in May  Wage growth over the past 12 months was 3 1  The unemployment rate  in the meanwhile  was near a 49 year low of 3 6   The broader measure of joblessness that includes part time workers  better known as the U6 rate  slipped to its lowest level in 19 years 5 Top Travel PicksCheaper gasoline prices  an upbeat labor market and uptick in consumer spending are prompting more number of people to plan a holiday

10902,232417,WYND,Ignore Trade War  Focus On U S  Economy  5 Top Picks,opinion,Early on Aug 8  China fired the latest salvo in the long running U S  China trade war  The People s Bank of China set the yuan s daily reference rate at 7 0039 against one U S  dollar  This is the lowest level experienced since Apr 21  2008  When the yuan breached the psychological level of 7 per dollar on Aug 5  the Treasury department was quick to call China a currency manipulator Meanwhile  U S  markets suffered a volatile day of trading on Aug 7  indicating that Wall Street s mood was being dictated by the yuan  But economists and experts alike feel that equity markets should focus on America s strong fundamentals instead of being swayed by external pressures Despite the slowdown in progress  the U S  economy remains robust  mostly because of strong consumer spending  which contributes the largest share of GDP  This is why it makes sense to invest in select consumer discretionary stocks at this time Services Gauges Strong  Expansion Continuing Earlier this week  key services gauges showed that the U S  economy continues to expand  though the pace of growth was slowing  The Institute of Supply Management s  ISM  services index declined from 55 1 in June to 53 7 in July  but remained robust enough  Meanwhile  IHS Markit s services gauge exceeded estimates to hit a level of 53 for the same period These readings are seen as a reliable indicator of America s economic health since services contribute nearly 85  of total GDP growth  The respondents of the ISM survey remained concerned about the likely fallout of the trade war  But the economy is continuing to expand  A slowdown is in the works  but respondents feel  clients are not balking  at the price rises caused by tariffs   Economic Indicators Robust  Recession UnlikelyEarlier this month  the Department of Labor released nonfarm payroll numbers for July  The U S  economy added 164 000 jobs last month  marginally lower than the estimated level of 165 000  In fact  job growth has continued for 106 straight months  the longest winning streak on record Further  unemployment remains at a 50 year low of 3 7   In fact  the figure has remained at 4  or lower for 16 straight months  the longest period in 50 years  There is enough evidence to indicate that wages are increasing at their fastest ever pace for historically lower paying industries  This is largely an outcome of state level hikes in minimum wage and persistently low unemployment And this is probably why economists feel that though a slowdown is underway  a near term recession is highly unlikely  According to the latest Commerce Department figures  U S  GDP hit a pace of 2 1  in the second quarter  lower than the rate of 3 1  witnessed in the first quarter  However  this was still largely above expectations and fueled by a robust increase in consumer spending Our ChoicesThe volatile session witnessed on Aug 7 is likely a symptom of the panic created by China s currency led retaliatory measures  At this time  investors would be advised to ignore ongoing trade tensions and focus on robust domestic economic fundamentals  Most

10920,232435,WYND,Millennials To Steer U S  Economy Toward Higher Growth  5 Picks,opinion,The United States is set to outpace other major developed economies of the world when it comes to the average age of America s working class  While economies such as Japan and Europe reel under the pressure of the ageing population  the United States is experiencing a boom in millennial population  the largest percentage of America s current workforce Furthermore  as Baby Boomers move toward retirement  the millennial and Gen Z cohort is set to boost America s economy by adding the power of the youth to its workforce  Changing consumption patterns  increased productivity  higher wages and more number of houses to be built should propel U S  economic growth in the years to come As it stands currently  the millennials have matched the Baby Boomers in terms of their influence on the economy  This is evident from the fact that consumption patterns across the United States have changed dramatically over the past decade  A similar impact would be made by the Gen Z  the population born between 1997 and 2012  by 2030s  when the current leading generational cohort moves toward their middle age Moreover  U S  consumer confidence remains high and the job market is robust  Under such conditions  investing in stocks from real estate  consumer discretionary and airline sectors seems prudent  Such sectors are directly impacted from a shift toward leisure spending Growth in Millennial Population Will Impact Consumption PatternPer a  published by Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  on Jan 25  2019  average consumption levels in the country would increase to 2 5  in the 2030s from just 1 7  in the past year  This would be due to the resultant impact from a change in the demographics of the United States over the next few years Further  the report also throws light on the fact that increased discretionary spending by the younger population would boost consumer spending and therefore overall U S  GDP  Moreover  this would more than make up for the decline in consumer spending by the Baby Boomers who would by then be well nearing their 80s and contributing to increased healthcare expenditure Sectors to Benefit From Healthy ConsumptionIt is a well known fact that while the Baby Boomers preferred living with families  millennials have a preference toward renting single family homes  This is because they increasingly move out of their cities in search of better jobs and standards of living  The real estate investment trusts stand to benefit the most from such developments as they can provide single family rented homes Better pay checks also lead to spending on leisure activities such as fine dining and entertainment  The space will witness a revolution in the days to come as millennials are likely to spend their disposable income on such products and services Needless to say  airlines  hotels and lodging would also benefit greatly from such improving conditions  As a matter of fact  even the retirees spend their savings on grand vacations  This will favorably impact air travel as well hotel industries Finally  younger people spend lavishly on stylish clothes and accessories  While the baby boomers are likely to spend less on apparels as they age  millennials and Gen Z would continue spending more and supporting gains for the space 5 Best PicksAs America s workforce remains relatively young compared to other major economies of the world  the country stands to gain  Further  a boom in young population  in the form of millennials and the Gen Z  has positively impacted the consumer spending  Stocks from the consumer discretionary sector  the real estate space  airlines as well as apparels will gain significantly from changing consumption patterns

10948,232463,WYND,3 Buys To  Catapult  Your Dividends To 8 6 ,opinion,"My best advice for you today is this  ignore the breathless trade war panicking and focus on one thing  cash 
Because the truth is  US companies like the 3 stout dividend growers we ll dive into below are swimming in it  So much so  in fact  that they don t know what to do with it all   so they re sending it right back out the door to us 
A Colossal Cash Stash
But don t take my word for it  ask the folks at UBS  who just said that US companies are sitting on nearly  2 5 trillion in cash  And that s just what they re holding inside America s borders  There s another  3 5 trillion squirreled away overseas 
On top of that  new cash is literally flowing in the door faster than management can send it out  As my colleague Michael Foster recently pointed out  S P 500 earnings are expected to spike 19  in the second quarter  after jumping nearly 25  in Q1 
And don t forget the  1 5 trillion tax cut businesses grabbed thanks to tax reform  They also gained the ability to bring foreign cash home at a lower tax rate 
Like Catching Rain in a Bucket
No wonder UBS says US companies are poised to drop  2 5 trillion on buybacks  dividends and mergers and acquisitions this year 
I m sure I don t have to tell you that all three of these moves  when done right  of course  line our pockets  It s just a question of how you want your profits  in cash  dividends  or gains  M A and buybacks  as both juice earnings  and share prices along with them  
So today we re going to zero in on 3 stocks that are doing the best job of using their cash piles to fatten our portfolios  starting with 
Cash Machine No  1  Rising Rates Catapult This Dividend Higher
SunTrust Banks  NYSE STI  just rolled out a 25  dividend hike on June 28  after passing the Federal Reserve s latest  stress test  for banks  It also announced a  2 0 billion share repurchase program 52  bigger than the previous one 
Funny thing is  hikes like these are standard fare for STI shareholders  Last summer  they grabbed a nice 53   pay raise  
But don t take that to mean STI s payout growth is slowing down  The stock still pays out a meager 29  of its  2 7 billion in yearly free cash flow  FCF  as dividends 
The stock has jumped more than 2  since the latest dividend hikes and buybacks were announced  but don t worry  you haven t missed your chance  the bank  which focuses on the fast growing southeast and mid Atlantic regions  is still cheap at 11 8 times FCF 
 An added plus  its regional focus gives it insulation from any trade war blowback  
Higher interest rates are  naturally  boosting the bank s net interest income  NII   SunTrust earned  1 44 billion in NII in the first quarter of 2018 versus  1 37 billion the same time period in 2017 a gain of 5 5  
That s a nice raise for doing nothing  and it helped along with a lower tax rate from tax reform and fewer shares outstanding due to its buybacks drive a 42  jump in earnings per share in the first quarter 
Management Knows a Bargain When It Sees One
And with the Federal Reserve poised to raise rates 2 more times this year  the bank s NII will keep quietly rising  giving it more room to up its dividend  current yield  2 4   and buybacks and its share price right along with them 
Cash Machine No  2  Buy This Hotel Operator Post Split
Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYND  was a bargain before it renamed itself Wyndham Destinations  WYND  and spun off its hotel arm as Wyndham Hotels   Resorts Inc  NYSE WH  in May   and both stocks are even cheaper now 
Shares of both the parent and the spinoff are down since the split occurred  which is normal as investors look at their portfolios  spot the two  new  stocks and decide which to keep and which to toss 
Wyndham Shareholders Rearrange the Furniture
So which is the better bet 
We re going to go with the  new  company  Wyndham Hotels  which is actually Wyndham s  old school  hotel business 
Why 
Because it uses a terrific business model to reap the most gains  at the least risk  from its 9 000 or so hotels in 80 countries 
It does it by offloading its risk to franchisees  who run its hotels on steady 10 to 20 year contracts  And Wyndham doesn t put its whole business on just a few owners  either  it has 5 700 in all  with most owning just one hotel 
More on WH in a moment 
First  if you re worried about the declines in the share price I just showed you  here s proof that spinoffs give you a great shot at beating the market in the long run 
Spinoffs Win Out
This is the performance of the Guggenheim S P Spin Off  NYSE CSD   the benchmark for spinoffs  which  as you can see  has crushed the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  since inception back in  06 
The bottom line  Any price decline after a spinoff is a buying opportunity 
Which brings us back to Wyndham Hotels   Resorts  which has the spinoff and a major acquisition behind it  the combined company closed its  2 billion purchase of La Quinta Holdings in May  then added it to WH 
La Quinta adds 900 hotels and bulks up WH s presence in the red hot upper midscale market  giving it a shiny lure for the exploding global middle class  a group the World Bank sees surging to 4 9 billion people by 2039 
Management also has a long history of buybacks  including in the run up to the spinoff and the closure of the La Quinta deal  while the combined company was trading at around 6 times cash flow 
Wyndham Buys Up Its Own Stock Pre Spinoff
Finally  Wyndham Hotels   Resorts and Wyndham Destinations have announced dividends of  0 25 and  0 41  respectively  That gives WH a 1 7  forward yield but plenty of room for higher payouts to come  especially when you consider that the combined company was only paying out 34  of FCF as dividends before the spinoff 
Cash Machine No  3  A Buyback  Jedi 
Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  is a buyback machine  having announced  1 5 billion in repurchases back in December  just as tax reform got the stamp of approval 
The thing that s striking about PRU s management is its Jedi like mastery of the buyback  knowing exactly when to buy the company s stock and when to hold off 
Look at its handiwork over the past year and at how PRU halted its buybacks when the stock rose  then boosted them on the dips 
Smart Buyback Strategy in Action
The stock has been dragged down with other financials as first level investors  euphoria over rising rates cooled  But that selloff was way overdone with PRU  which now trades at a totally absurd 2 9 times FCF  Heck  it even trades at 77  of book value  or less than it would be worth if it were sold off in pieces today 
And get this  the company s  60 billion in yearly revenue is 50  higher than its market cap 
It s a complete injustice  especially given that PRU s retirement products set it up to gain as more baby boomers get set to clock out of the workforce 
That  plus PRU s smart buybacks  will amplify its dividend growth  because buybacks leave it with fewer shares on which to pay out   the stock yields 3 8  now and has already more than doubled its payout in the last 5 years 
A Shareholder Return Machine
How to Turn Prudential s 3 8  Dividend Into 8 6 
If you buy stocks based on their current dividend yields  like the 3 7   3 8  and 2 4  the 3 stocks above pay   I ve got bad news for you 
You re looking at the wrong number 
What you really need to focus on is your  yield on cost  that is  how much of a yield you d be pocketing on a buy you make today  say  5 years out from now 
Let s look at Prudential  LON PRU   with its 3 8  dividend  That s nice  but if management were to boost the payout 125  in the next 5 years as it has in the last 5 you d be pocketing a tidy 8 6  on your original investment 
That s more like it 
But of course  you ll need Prudential to keep its fantastic dividend streak going   and it should be able to  But of course  that s not guaranteed 
Luckily  there s my  8  No Withdrawal  retirement portfolio   It hands you an average payout of 8  today there will be no waiting  and hoping  till 2023 to get a life changing dividend like that 
And when I say  life changing   I mean it  With an average payout that high  you can put the one thing every retiree wants solidly within your grasp  the ability to retire on dividends alone  without having to sell a single stock in your golden years 
And remember  that 8  dividend is just the average  You ll also find payers of even bigger income streams of 8 7  and higher

10949,232464,WYND,Is Wyndham Destinations  WYND  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Wyndham Destinations  Inc    NYSE WYND   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Wyndham Destinations has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 2  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Wyndham Destinations  current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint  which is 17 0  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Wyndham Destinations has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Wyndham Destinations has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Wyndham Destinations currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes WYND a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Wyndham Destinations is just 2 2  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 4  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 13 0  Clearly  WYND is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Wyndham Destinations might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D  This gives WYND a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen nearly 3 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWyndham Destinations is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a good industry rank  top 41  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act

10952,232467,WYND,Will Slump In U S  Tourism  Decelerating RevPar Hurt Hotels ,opinion,"Though the hotel industry performed well in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018  there are a number of threats that remain  Unfavorable government policies  uncertainty in certain markets and RevPAR pressure pose challenges for industry players  These issues could potentially offset the group s positive growth prospects in the near to mid term 
Decline in U S  Tourism a Major Concern
Travel and tourism has witnessed a decline in the past few years  At the recent annual NYU International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference  Jonathan Tisch  Chairman and CEO of Loews  L  and Chairman Emeritus of the U S  Travel Association  said travel and tourism is an  8 trillion market and represents approximately 10  of global GDP  He further said that that the sector is likely to grow by  3 5 trillion over the next decade 
Despite the growth in the global tourism  the U S  share of the market has declined roughly 13  over the past few years  International visitors have declined 7 4 million over that time period 
The Trump administration s restrictive policies on immigration and tourist visas appear to have played a role  The slowdown in U S  bound air travel bookings ever since the Trump administration came into office also point in that direction  Also  online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have declined 
Continuous efforts to impose a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations  along with the ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U S  bound aircraft from certain countries and talks of expanding the same threaten travel demand to and from the United States 
While the U S  tourism industry remains very strong  the change at the margin is less robust than could potentially have been without these restrictive policies  which is a net negative for many industry players 
Decelerating RevPar Growth   Rising Costs
Though  per the recent estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC   RevPar in 2018 is estimated to increase to 3  from 2 9  in 2017  the rate of growth has declined sharply over the past few years  Most of the hotel companies in the United States have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room  RevPAR  trends of late because of continued muted international visitation  Moreover  continued increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents  thereby hurting RevPAR 
With an improvement in the economy and drop in unemployment levels  industry players will struggle to control their largest operating expense   labor costs  Rising salaries  wages and benefits  as well as increased staffing levels will add to their labor costs 
Uncertainty in a Few International Markets 
In spite of immense growth potential  industry players are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social political impact of Brexit and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia  Though Trump s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia  instead of the United States  these regions have their own share of concerns 
Notably  a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and limiting overall sales  In fact  a weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil resulted in softer tourism numbers in 2015  2016 and 2017  This is not expected to change much in 2018  Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to limit revenues of hotel industry players 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Terror assaults in key European cities like London  Paris  Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism  Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind  Additionally  concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
Meanwhile  in the Middle East  political unrest  lower government spending  new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends  Any respite from these headwinds in the region is not expected in the near term 
Most of the leading hotel companies have considerable presence in the above mentioned markets and are thus vulnerable to adverse economic conditions in these regions 
Stocks to Avoid
Players in the space that induce our cautious to bearish outlook are Red Lion Hotels Corp   RLH   China Lodging Group  Ltd   HTHT  and Wyndham Destinations  Inc   WYND   Red Lion Hotels carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   whereas China Lodging Group and Wyndham Destinations have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
You can see  
Wrapping Up
Decline in inbound international travelers is a major concern for the industry  Continuous efforts to impose inbound travel ban from certain countries and stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas are clouding the prospects of the U S  hotel industry  Additionally  various geopolitical and economic woes  oversupply and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the industry 
A strengthening U S  dollar may further add to the woes  Nevertheless  it remains to be seen whether improving economic indicators and initiatives undertaken by the industry players can offset these negatives 
Let us see how these companies fare  brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days 
The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All

10954,232469,WYND,Can Value Investors Consider WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS  WYND  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS  INC    NYSE WYND   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 7  If we focus on the long term PE trend  WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS  current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 16 4 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  WYND is lower than the mid point of 1 8 of the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS is 2 1  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2 2x  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  WYND is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has Growth and Momentum Scores of F  This gives WYND a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen two downward revisions in the past sixty days compared to one upward revision  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 6 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched down 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below WYNDHAM DESTINATIONS  INC  Price and Consensus   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWYNDHAM DESTINATIONS is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 37  of more than 250 industries  instils our confidence However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3

10968,232483,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry Outlook   June 2018,opinion,"Stocks in the hotel industry are benefiting from growth in demand that supports increases in both occupancy and average daily rate  ADR   The momentum in the U S  hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017  In first quarter 2018  the industry witnessed a better than expected rise in demand  with revenue per available room  RevPAR  increasing by 3 5  
Consequently  stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year  handily outperforming the broader market  as a reflection of this positive backdrop  The  has rallied 20 2   surpassing the S P 500 index s gain of 14 5  
The industry looks attractive  owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand  Further  we note that rising employment  higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment  This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel  and higher transaction volumes  which are likely to continue 
The unemployment rate declined from 3 9  in April to 3 8  in May  the lowest in 18 years  The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and people sporadically looking for jobs  declined to 7 6   the lowest level witnessed since May 2001 
Going forward  consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat  suggesting that the U S  economy will remain on solid footing in 2018  In fact  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4 8   annualized rate  GDP growth in second quarter 2018 
Numbers Look Impressive
A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  shows that new supply is likely to rise 2  in 2018  up from 1 8  in 2017  This is likely to result in 0 3  increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66 3   Moreover  ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2 6  and 3   respectively this year  In 2019  the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2 8  each 
Meanwhile  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  rose 1 6  in April 2018  In fact  in a year  the index has gained 12 7  
Additionally  according to Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  U S  hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics  However  the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017  Despite this  the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental 
Decline in International Travel a Concern
Fall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U S  lodging industry  Moreover  negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States  given Trump administration s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas is detrimental to hotels  If the U S  dollar gains strength  this may keep industry growth in check  given its impact on inbound international travel 
Additionally  higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds 
Meanwhile  hotel companies have been focusing on renovation  and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits  High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers  In fact  online travel agents like Booking com  BKNG   Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and TripAdvisor  TRIP  are also limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc   which offer digital service  allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  and Marriott International  Inc   MAR   Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Catalysts Driving Growth
The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions  So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018  raising optimism for hotel companies  Moreover  hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better  if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services 
Also  these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory  In fact  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hotel chains like Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYND    WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 
So far in 2018  the hotel industry has proved to be resilient amid marketplace shift  Going forward  the industry is likely to witness continued success 
Thus  as hotel companies strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among millennials   will remain priorities  Focused investment in infrastructure to attract business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth

Conclusion
The U S  hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy  higher income  increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market  As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points  companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand 
The U S  economy expanded at a pace of 2 3  in the first quarter  above the consensus estimate  However  it represents a decline from 3  witnessed in the last three quarters of 2017  While declines were felt across all components  consumer spending declined significantly after strong gains in the fourth quarter of 2017 
This may appear to be a concern at the first glance but first quarter figures have been dismal in recent years due to statistical and weather related issues  Other consumer related indicators are on the rise  which means that consumer spending should pick up in the rest of the year  Investing in consumer discretionary stocks looks like a smart option at this point  Further  the U S  economy is expected to expand at a 4  annualized rate in the second quarter  per the latest forecast by Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow 
Thus  we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and bottom lines in the near to middle term  especially when the unemployment rate is at a 18 year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade

We observe that Hyatt shares have rallied 45 5  over the past six months  outperforming the  s 39 2  growth 
Let us discuss the rationale behind Hyatt s expansion strategies  enhancementof World of Hyatt and its prospects 
International Expansion to Counter Competition
The strategy is in line with Hyatt s consistent efforts to expand presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in relatively untapped international markets  In fact  the company also has expansion plans for Europe  Asia Pacific  Africa  Middle East and Latin America  
International expansion should help the company increase its market share  thus boosting its business  We believe that the strategy is also part of Hyatt s plan to leapfrog competitors like Marriott   NASDAQ MAR    Wyndham   NYSE WYN   and Hilton   NYSE H   in the race to expand in untapped markets 
Loyalty Program Eyes at Top Line Growth
Successful innovation has been a trademark of Hyatt  with a commitment to customer friendly services in both the large scale convention and smaller leisure markets  By expansion of its loyalty program beyond traditional hotel stays  Hyatt is trying to facilitate greater guest engagement in home spaces that would eventually raise occupancy  
The company has been devising newer ways to enhance its guest loyalty program  In fact  it is already witnessing a higher level of guest satisfaction due to the enhancement of World of Hyatt  As of Dec 31  2017  the loyalty program had over 10 million active members  During 2017  approximately 30  of total system wide room nights were favored by the program 
Hyatt believes that enhanced guest experience would drive occupancy  which in turn would favor its top line  By building a substantial demand from offering select services to guests and expanding units  the company is trying to facilitate revenue per available room  RevPAR  growth  In fact  for 2018  the company expects to grow units  on a net room basis  by roughly 6  to 6 5   reflecting 60 new hotel openings

10996,232511,WYND,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Marriott  InterContinental  Hyatt  Hilton And Wyndham,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 22  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Ecommerce  including Marriott International   NASDAQ MAR    InterContinental Hotels Group   NYSE IHG    Hyatt Hotels Corp    NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide   NYSE H   and Wyndham Worldwide   NYSE WYN   Industry  Hotels  Part 2Link   Despite the prevailing challenges such as unfavorable governmental policies  uncertainty in specific markets and RevPAR pressure  economic fundamentals appear strong enough to support modest growth in the hotel space in the short to medium term  and without any additional stimulus GDP grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the fourth quarter of 2017  following gains of more than 3  in the previous two quarters  per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  This marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009 Consumer spending grew 3 8  in the fourth quarter after a 2 2  gain in the third  The trend is expected to continue through 2018  raising optimism for companies in the leisure and recreation space Again  there was a marked improvement in the Consumer Confidence Index in January  after a setback in December  Consumer Confidence rose 2 3 points to 125 4 in January  The momentum is expected to continue through 2018  Confident consumers bode well for hotels in spite of the surge in new inventory Thus  we see no reason why the U S  hotel industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom line In fact  there are a number of reasons why the broader hotel space should continue doing well over both short and medium terms A Favorable Demand Supply GapA strong economy  higher income and stepped up consumer confidence has raised demand for both leisure and business travel  The supply demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010  with growth in demand outpacing supply growth  Though  of late  the gap between demand and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has slowed  higher average daily rates  ADRs  are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year  which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U S  lodging industry  PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  is projecting demand  2 1  rise  to outpace supply  increase of 1 9   in 2018 Attempts to DifferentiateWith the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially in the luxury space  hotels are firing on all cylinders to differentiate themselves  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes that customers are currently looking for Moreover  U S  hospitality companies are increasingly targeting millennials  who form a significant part of the population  Millennials are generally more concerned about health  convenience  service and ethical sourcing of food This is probably the reason why big hotel brands are launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands benefiting from the parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Marriott International s Element  Aloft and Edition  InterContinental Hotels Group s Hotel Indigo and Andaz by Hyatt Hotels Corp Efforts to Expand GloballyMajor hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in relatively untapped emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises significant growth  despite an economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially ahead  Notably  China is the largest source market for outbound travel now  In fact  Chinese outbound travel  according to Chinese authorities in the sector  is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott  where it entered into a joint venture with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  with an aim to improve market share  expand membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs  India is also becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market In fact  Hyatt s major target markets include India and China  Apart from these  the company has also announced further expansion plans into diverse international markets including Australia  Brazil  Germany  United Kingdom  Indonesia  Japan  Mexico  Saudi Arabia  Singapore  Thailand and the Netherlands  among others Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton Worldwide and Wyndham Worldwide have a strong foothold in this region Many of the hoteliers are also looking to leverage from Latin America s upsurge in accommodation demand  In this respect  Wyndham Hotel Group acquired Latin America s leading Fen Hotels  Meanwhile  with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to

10998,232513,WYND,3 Hotel Stocks Sheltered From The US China Trade Spat,opinion,The prevailing dispute between the United States and China Trade threaten to wreak most markets that are sensitive to business cycle fluctuations  The hospitality industry therefore might not be able to survive the effects of a trade clash  The hotel space  which largely depends on consumer discretionary spending  is constantly apprehensive about a trade war dampening consumer confidence It is also to be noted that President Trump s stringent policies have made United States a somewhat less popular tourist destination  Per the UN World Tourism Organization  United States reported a 2  decline in foreign tourist count in 2017 However  there are a few factors backing hotel stocks amid the turmoil  Let s take a look Why Trade Disputes Might Not be as HarrowingPer the U S  Travel Association  a large part of employment in the United States is directly reliant on tourism  Travel industry added 3 900 jobs in March after the robust 8 400 addition in February  Moreover  per the official data  Chinese tourism accounted for  33 billion spending in the United States in 2016  Further  U S  National Travel and Tourism Office forecasts tourist count to reach 4 5 million by 2022   China s outbound tourism is currently growing around 6  per year  with predictions of more than 200 million Chinese traveling overseas by 2022 Although a brewing trade war might deal a blow to United States  tourist numbers from China  it wouldn t be very severe as the major beneficiaries of Chinese tourism in America are democratic states such as California  Illinois  Massachusetts and New York Also  a rivalry that can affect tourism and hospitality industry goes against China s business interest  This is because a number of its tour agencies  tour companies and airlines have huge holdings in the United States  Even U S  tour operators are linked with large hoteliers who have significant hold in China Given this scenario  the countries might not want to put their tourism industry at stake by waging a trade war US Hotels to Sustain Modest GrowthDespite the challenges  we see no reason why the U S  hotel industry should not continue to gain on both the top and the bottom line  The domestic economy  currently  is favorable for hospitality companies  The overall economy shows increased consumer demand for goods and services  According to the Fed s latest forecast  the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2 7  in 2018  Unemployment is predicted at 3 8  for 2018 versus the current 4 1   Moreover  high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in the higher purchasing behavior  The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending after three years Moreover  a strong economy  higher income and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel  The supply demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010  with growth in demand outpacing supply growth Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year  which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U S  lodging industry  PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  expects demand  2 1  rise  to outpace supply  increase of 1 9   in 2018  Moreover  per a report by Deloitte  the hotel industry is estimated to sustain a strong 5  to 6  growth throughout 2018 Also  the  has rallied 32  in the past year  outperforming the S P 500 market s 14 7  Initiatives Adopted by Bigwigs EncourageIn order to capitalize on the growing demand for hotels and leisure  top hoteliers like Marriot International   NASDAQ MAR    Hilton   NYSE H   and Hyatt   NYSE H   are continuously opting for ways to provide highest consumer satisfaction  By moving toward launching more lifestyle hotels  these operators are increasingly targeting consumers more concerned about health  convenience  service and ethical sourcing of food  who also form a significant part of the population Embracing digital innovations and loyalty programs  these hotel bigwigs are relentlessly expanding their customer base and market share  Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience  which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more These  therefore  are a few reasons why the broader hotel space should continue doing well in both the short and medium term Picking the Right StocksWe have taken the help of  to pick hotel

11001,232516,WYND,My Easy  1 Step Plan For 100   Gains  And 3x Dividend Income ,opinion,"You and I both know that dividends just don t get much respect from most folks 
But most folks have it all wrong  I ll show you why in a moment  I ll also reveal 2  accelerating  dividends to put on your buy list now  
First  it s easy to see why dividends are  way too often  an afterthought  it s tough to get excited about them when the typical S P 500 name dribbles out the measly 1 9  yield it does today 
It gets worse when you look at the US inflation rate  2 1  as of March 
So at best  you can hope your dividends offset inflation  while you hope the underlying stock price soars  The problem with  buy and hope  is that every so often you get a period like this 
 Buy and Hope  Flunks the Test 
But don t worry  there s a safer way to grab rising income and gains in stocks  And it all comes back to the unloved dividend 
The Key to Lasting Wealth
Here s what most folks overlook  dividends are  in fact  the key to getting rich in the stock market 
But it s not the current dividend yield we need to look at  it s dividend growth  Because here s something that may surprise you  a rising dividend is the No  1 driver of share prices 
3M s 100  Predictable Dividend Afterburner
If you don t believe me  consider 3M Company  NYSE MMM   a  stodgy  company with a ho hum 2 5  yield  So once inflation bites  you re left with a pathetic 0 4  in income 
But don t forget that 3M is a charter member of the Dividend Aristocrats  having hiked its payout for 60 straight years  The connection between its rising dividend and its rising share price is unmistakable 
Check out how the payout drives up the share price at almost exactly the same rate over just about any time period you can imagine  starting with 3 years 
Dividend Up 33   Shares Up 36  
And then 5 years 
Dividend Up 114   Shares Up 109  
10 years 
Dividend Up 172   Shares Up 173  
And finally  the longest timeline we can get 
Dividend Up 1 110   Shares Up 1 960  
There s simply no arguing with that pattern  And I can point you to dozens of stocks whose surging payouts are driving their share prices higher in the same way  including the two I ll reveal in a second  
Now you could simply jump on 3M s dividend train today  and you ll likely see similar results over the long haul but there is just one little thing that gives me pause about the stock  the payout ratio 
3M pays out 58  of its last 12 months of free cash flow  FCF  as dividends  and while that s reasonably safe  just over the 50  I demand in stocks I recommend in    it s near historic highs and trending higher 
That could crimp the payout s growth  and its ability to pry the stock higher  if sales skid 
A Tightening Noose  
So what s our strategy here  Simple  We ll go on the hunt for stocks with share prices that have fallen behind their dividend growth  plus boast a safe payout ratio that can keep fueling that dividend higher 
That way we can buy as the stock price races to catch up  Which brings me around to the 2 names I want to show you today 
Buy Wyndham as Its Dividend  Splits 
Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN   You can see that the hotel operator s share price was keeping pace with the dividend until early 2016 
 Dividend Gap  Opens 
But as you can also see  it s not because Wyndham s share price fell off  the stock has actually soared since it broke pace with the dividend in late 2015  it s that management pumped up the dividend even faster 
This is an unusual situation that can t last  for two reasons 
First  Airbnb or no  travelers are booking Wyndham s hotels  resorts and timeshares at a rapid clip  in the fourth quarter  revenue per available room a vital hotel metric jumped 4 5   overall revenue rose 4 4   and adjusted earnings per share  EPS  surged 10  
And the dividend is safe  eating up a minuscule 29  of FCF and falling 
Second  Wyndham is getting to set to spin off its hotel business into a new publicly traded company  while hanging on to its timeshare and vacation rental operations 
  buying a spinoff stock that s cranking up its dividend and making your move either just before or just after a split is a strategy I ve seen deliver market beating gains time and time again 
Plus you could end up with two income streams instead of one 
The kicker  Wyndham is cheap  at just 15 5 times forward earnings  which throws a floor under the share price while amplifying our upside 
Amex  Overdue for a Payout Powered Surge
American Express  NYSE AXP   You may think you missed out on this one after it surged last week on strong earnings  But Amex s comeback is still young 
The stock is all but locked in for one more lurch later this summer  when I expect it to unveil its next big dividend hike  Let s unpack why  starting with this 
The Dividend Star Wall Street Missed 
That s right  even though Amex is clearly turning the corner after losing its exclusive deal with Costco  NASDAQ COST  back in 2016  the market remains in deep denial  And consider this  Even with this latest bump  AXP still trades at just 14 1 times forward earnings 
That s ridiculous for a company whose Q1 EPS soared 38   crushing the Street s forecast  Revenue surged 12   The main reason  Cardholder spending spiked 12   and Amex added 3 5 million new members 
Add in the fact that Amex s clients are mainly wealthy folks a group that s growing and a paltry 10  of FCF heads out the door as dividends  and you get a recipe for a big payout hike and upside as the stock races to catch up 
3 More 100   Dividend Growth Picks Yours Free 
Just days ago  I held a free live webinar in which I released 2 more dividend growth picks  and you can get both of them when you  
Here are the details on the 2 companies I ll tell you about in this tight  60 minute webinar 

This ignored stock boosted its payout 3 times in the last 7 quarters  and its payout is surging 20  a year  And this one already pays a princely 4 5  current yield 
This bank is a cash gusher  It just dropped a 67  payout hike on its lucky investors  and management is poised to DOUBLE the dividend again in less than 2 years 

And that s not all   you ll also get a chance to get a THIRD pick I released on Friday 
My proven Dividend Velocity System  which I ll also spill the beans on in this unique webinar  says this one will do even better than the 2 stocks I reveal in the rebroadcast  But space is limited to get onboard before this unsung stock takes off 
Don t miss out on the chance to grab these 3 terrific stock picks  Turn up your computer s speakers  or put on a pair of headphones    It could be the best investment move you make all year

11014,232529,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry To Sustain Modest Growth In 2018,opinion,"Despite the prevailing challenges such as unfavorable governmental policies  uncertainty in specific markets and RevPAR pressure  economic fundamentals appear strong enough to support modest growth in the hotel space in the short to medium term  and without any additional stimulus 
GDP grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the fourth quarter of 2017  following gains of more than 3  in the previous two quarters  per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  This marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009 
Consumer spending grew 3 8  in the fourth quarter after a 2 2  gain in the third  The trend is expected to continue through 2018  raising optimism for companies in the leisure and recreation space 
Again  there was a marked improvement in the Consumer Confidence Index in January  after a setback in December  Consumer Confidence rose 2 3 points to 125 4 in January  The momentum is expected to continue through 2018  Confident consumers bode well for hotels in spite of the surge in new inventory 
Thus  we see no reason why the U S  hotel industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom line 
In fact  there are a number of reasons why the broader hotel space should continue doing well over both short and medium terms 
A Favorable Demand Supply Gap
A strong economy  higher income and stepped up consumer confidence has raised demand for both leisure and business travel  The supply demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010  with growth in demand outpacing supply growth  Though  of late  the gap between demand and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has slowed  higher average daily rates  ADRs  are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  
Given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year  which could result in the ninth successive year of occupancy growth for the U S  lodging industry  PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  is projecting demand  2 1  rise  to outpace supply  increase of 1 9   in 2018 
Attempts to Differentiate
With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially in the luxury space  hotels are firing on all cylinders to differentiate themselves  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes that customers are currently looking for 
Moreover  U S  hospitality companies are increasingly targeting millennials  who form a significant part of the population  Millennials are generally more concerned about health  convenience  service and ethical sourcing of food 
This is probably the reason why big hotel brands are launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands benefiting from the parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Marriott International s  MAR  Element  Aloft and Edition  InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo and Andaz by Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  
Efforts to Expand Globally
Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in relatively untapped emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities 
A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises significant growth  despite an economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially ahead  Notably  China is the largest source market for outbound travel now  In fact  Chinese outbound travel  according to Chinese authorities in the sector  is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years 
Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott  where it entered into a joint venture with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  with an aim to improve market share  expand membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs  India is also becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market 
In fact  Hyatt s major target markets include India and China  Apart from these  the company has also announced further expansion plans into diverse international markets including Australia  Brazil  Germany  United Kingdom  Indonesia  Japan  Mexico  Saudi Arabia  Singapore  Thailand and the Netherlands  among others 
Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton Worldwide  HLT   Choice Hotels  CHH  and Wyndham Worldwide  WYN  have a strong foothold in this region 
Many of the hoteliers are also looking to leverage from Latin America s upsurge in accommodation demand  In this respect  Wyndham Hotel Group acquired Latin America s leading Fen Hotels  Meanwhile  with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75  by 2018 
Increasing Loyalty Programs
Loyalty programs have become one of the best ways to counter the tough operating environment and enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  Given the fact that rewards  members stay longer than nonmembers and generate more revenues for their franchisees  hoteliers have been increasingly focusing on their loyalty programs 
Notably  with about 52 million members  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry  In fact  as per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company  Wyndham Rewards is touted to be the most rewarding loyalty program in the U S  hotel industry with an average return of 16 7  in value on every dollar spent on a room booking  Notably  the company expects Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit its new owner growth target of 23  
Meanwhile  post acquisition of Starwood  Marriott has linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community  Loyalty programs are Marriott s most powerful marketing platform  and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations designed to provide a more rewarding experience to guests 
In first quarter 2017  Hyatt launched a new loyalty program  World of Hyatt  which replaced its Gold Passport loyalty program  The company expects the program to build even higher levels of guest preference and help in sustaining market share gains 
Notably  Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs  Hilton Honors  With more than 63 million members  this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company  In fact  about 57  of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program  Choice Hotels  loyalty program  Choice Privileges  is rapidly expanding and continues to drive guests to its franchisees  hotels 
The program recently surpassed 32 million members and has already added more than 2 5 million new members so far this year  Loyalty programs are thus the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience 
Embracing Technology
Digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role in hotels  increased push to retain customers  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers to select hotels and in this way they are enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests 
Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and offering interactive maps GPS to increase occupancy and offer a faster and seamless experience  They are investing in mobile check in  fast Wi Fi  and digital room keys to enhance guest experience 
In fact  mobile check ins and check outs have increased substantially over the past few years and so has the enthusiasm for chat based messaging apps  like chatbots  among potential hotel customers  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry  Thus  the majority of hoteliers are investing in mobile check in  fast Wi Fi  and digital room keys to enhance guest experience 
Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences and deliver a differentiated experience  which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more 
Key Picks
Top ranked stocks in the hotel space include Intercontinental Hotels Group  LON IHG   Hilton and Marriott  each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Hilton s earnings for 2018 are projected to increase 20   The company reported strong fourth quarter 2017 results  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings and revenues  Its scale  size  commercial platform and industry leading brands continue to drive unit growth 
Marriott s earnings for 2018 are projected to increase 21 6   The company s strong fourth quarter 2017 results surpassed the consensus mark on both counts  Marriott continues to benefit from the Starwood acquisition  rising North American business  sizable international exposure and an attractive brand position 
Intercontinental Hotels has reasonable earnings growth prospects as the lodgings industry continues to strengthen  The company s earnings for 2018 are projected to increase 12 1   Its asset light strategy complements its pricing levels and facilitates free cash growth 
Despite being a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock  we are optimistic about Wyndham  given its positive outlook for 2018 
Bottom Line
With the economy showing signs of recovery  the lodging sector is likely to prove to be a worthy investment proposition in the near to medium term 
Particularly  hoteliers with experience  strong equity  compelling brands and unique ideas in great markets  and those that are solid borrowers and considered trustworthy will be able to expand and convert some of the challenges into opportunities going forward 
Also  hoteliers will have to be smart enough to capitalize on the shifting trends and adapt as per changing consumer expectations  Instead of offering intricate programs and schemes to gain customer loyalty  hotel companies must focus on a re imagined technology strategy  and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences  Loyalty will follow automatically

11017,232532,WYND,Is Hyatt A Takeover Target Or Just A Short ,opinion,"Hyatt Hotels  stock price has jumped 50  over the trailing 12 months
That is great  but there are troubling signs that the company is falling behind the competition
Worse  recent moves by management have alienated the one hospitality factor that counts most  traveler loyalty
This article is Part III of a look at the lodging   hospitality industry  In Part I  here  I provided an overview of the industry  the differences between owners of the physical lodging properties and the management companies that actually train the staff and do the hiring  firing  maintenance and so on  The third leg of this triad consists of the big  flags  like Hyatt  NYSE H   Hilton  NYSE HLT   Intercontinental  NYSE IHG   Marriott International  NASDAQ MAR   Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  and Accor  PA ACCP  SA  OTC ACCYY  that bring the guests to the properties even though they seldom own the hotels themselves  It s a good place to begin if you want to understand this rapidly consolidating industry 
In Part II  here  I discussed the latest assault on hotel profitability  the rapid growth of Airbnb  VRBO  and online travel agencies  OTAs   I concluded that most hotel owners  managers and branders were doing the right things to stay on the green side of the grass  I also recommended a hotel property owner I think is particularly well situated to survive and grow  You may find that article a valuable preamble to today s discussion as well 
In this article I d like to circle back to a company that I do not see as keeping up with industry trends  indeed  I see them doing a lot of things wrong  That company is the once private  then publicly traded  then private again  and now public again Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  
It pains me to reach this conclusion  Hyatt instituted its frequent guest program   Hyatt Gold Passport   in 1987  30 years after Jay Pritzker began the company with a purchase of a motel  the Hyatt House  at Los Angeles International Airport  Jay Pritzker was a legendary dealmaker and his brother Donald a fine manager and soon other purchases of lodging properties followed 
Hyatt enjoyed good profitability as well as good growth  both domestically and internationally  I was just ending my career as a road warrior in 1987 when I chose to make Hyatt my personal first choice of flag hotels  Now retired from a large company running my own business  no corporation pays for my stays  Because of their fine properties and stellar service  Hyatt has until recently simply been my go to first hotel company for both business and leisure travel 
I should be clear that the actual Hyatt branded and often Hyatt managed hotels are not the problem  In the USA  the company s Hyatt Regencys  Grand Hyatts and Park Hyatts compare favorably to luxury hotels anywhere  Having been a guest in many Hyatt competitors  top offerings  I still find these Hyatts among my top stays and recommend them to others for a special vacation or business treat  I imagine you will recognize many of them  and see why Hyatt until recently has done so well

Honorable Mention to the now departed Hyatt Regency Auckland NZ   not sure who brands it now   and to a Hyatt  House   a Hyatt limited service mid brand  at Schiphol airport  Amsterdam  It may as well have been a Hyatt Regency and it serves a magnificent breakfast and is just a 15 minute train ride into way more crowded Amsterdam 
Speaking strategically  Hyatt missed a critical opportunity at the end of 2015 when the company announced it was in talks to acquire Starwood Hotels  This wasn t exactly Jonah swallowing the whale but Starwood was bigger than Hyatt  at the time Hyatt owned just over 600 properties and Starwood owned more than 2000   Regrettably  Hyatt couldn t come to terms with Starwood and let them get away  Marriott immediately stepped in  Today  Hyatt has some 750 hotels worldwide with about 70 000 rooms
Marriott now has more than 6 200 hotels with more than 1 200 000 rooms 
There are two flags that have even more  Choice Hotels Intl  NYSE CHH  with just under 6 600 hotels  but just 500 000 rooms  and Wyndham Worldwide  WYN  with 8 200 hotels 9000 when they complete their acquisition of La Quinta   and 710 000 rooms   800 000 including La Quinta 
The reason for such a disparity between number of rooms per hotel in the case of CHH and WYN is that both specialize in economy and mid scale brands like Choice s Econo Lodge  Comfort Inn and Sleep Inn and Wyndham s Days Inn  Knights Inn and Super 8  This approach is profitable  just not as profitable as the luxury flags  offerings and the extra income that comes from food and beverage sales  conferences and other amenities 
For comparison  Accor  ACCYY   Hilton  HLT  and Intercontinental  IHG  also have between five and eight times the number of hotels under their flags than Hyatt does 
In the hotel business  size matters  Presence matters  Loyalty programs matter  Hyatt risks becoming a footnote in the hotel industry unless they can rapidly expand or join forces with another firm  They have a plan in place to grow by 40  over the coming couple years  That still leaves them a smaller player than Carlson or Best Western 

Yes  Hyatt has ownership of  a management relationship with  or a branding agreement with some amazing properties however those properties will still be amazing under some other hotelier s nameplate 
Hyatt s failure to achieve the economy of scale of its erstwhile peers  preferring short term profits to long term results  has affected the bottom line  of course  Return on Invested Capital is the lowest of its peer group above  Gross margins are the lowest of the group except for Marriott  which is still digesting Starwood  Operating margins are also the lowest of the group and Net Margins the worst of all except Hilton  whose numbers may be skewed short term as a result of the spinoff of Park Hotels  NYSE PK   Hyatt is also the only one of the group that pays no dividend 
If we view the company in relation only to its own numbers  which current management seems to be doing  Hyatt is doing OK  But we cannot view a company in a competitive industry like this in a vacuum  If I am in a marathon beating my own previous best time but everyone else has upped their game at twice this rate and are leaving me in the dust  it is time for some serious soul searching 
To further our understanding of this insularity  let me cite some key thoughts from management via their most recent  November 2017  investor presentation 
Under  Key Investment Considerations  the company cites  Owner  manager and franchisor  uniquely focused on the high end traveler  
 Uniquely focused   Look  I wish Hyatt no ill  I want them to survive  And I have been a guest at more than 130 of their discrete properties  including lots of Hyatt Place and Hyatt Houses in order to earn the points to stay at some Park Hyatt properties  I have also stayed at some Conrad and Waldorf Astoria hotels  Hilton   Sofitel and Fairmonts  Accor  and Westin and Ritz Carltons  Marriott   As long as Hyatt fails to recognize that deeper pocketed competitors with better geographic dispersion are also seeking  the high end   read  spends more  traveler they will dig themselves further into a cul de sac 
A couple slides later they talk about their 12 brands but only show 10  I discovered the other two  the Unbound Collection  a collection of  boutique hotels  and a relationship of some sort with Oasis  which deals in private home rentals  This is where they also placed the aforementioned noisy  creaky  but well located Hotel du Louvre I thought they had sold  Then there are the Hyatt Residence Clubs  a fancy term for overpriced timeshares  More on this later 

Source  
As for Hyatt s notion of  luxury  I couldn t agree more about Park Hyatt and most Grand Hyatts  But Andaz  I ve stayed in three  two of which were converted to Andaz from Hyatts I previously enjoyed  They are staffed by persons in the Abercrombie and Fitch  NYSE ANF  mold  Check in consists of staff looking down their sniffly little noses in the classic  Are you certain you belong at an Andaz   look  followed by a  Very well  I suppose you paid so we shall deign to give you a key  half smile  It s supposed to be hip and trendy  It doesn t work 
I will accept their  Upper Upscale  moniker as well  but a Hyatt Place upscale   Focused on high end travelers   Really  These are very nice rooms and fulfill the old Holiday Inn pledge of  no surprises   I ve stayed at for a fair price and a good location  But I don t see dining cheek by jowl for a nothing special breakfast in a too small dining area upscale  I m not being picky here   I am simply concerned that if this is what Hyatt considers upscale they are wearing rose colored glasses 
Further on  they discuss  Recent Activity   I applaud their capital strategy of selling  1 5 billion of gross real estate assets  The problem is they are years late in so doing  This is a trend well in force already by all their competitors   see Hilton s spinoff of 67 touchstone properties worth  9 billion to form Park Hotels and Resorts  PK   As for brands  they note they acquired Miraval and exhale  including three resorts  from Miraval  Marriott is acquiring thousands of rooms  Hyatt is buying three resorts 
Then they talk about share repurchase as if that is somehow germane to their future plans  Mixing apples and oranges  they talk corporate strategy and stock price in the same breath  What are they thinking  Who is in charge here 
Which brings me to the real problem  drifting  What does Hyatt stand for these days  It was once  The Hyatt Touch   Friendly and capable staff  well maintained rooms  and quality touches throughout in fine locations  At Andaz  they are clearly  touched  but that is hardly the same thing  The Hyatt was where  if you ran out of shave cream they didn t direct you to the gift shop  they brought some up  If they failed to deliver a newspaper they just said   One moment  I ll get one from the bell desk for you   The little things  The Hyatt Touch 
That is no longer in evidence at many properties  It is now about the money  I expect to pay more for a Hyatt Regency than a Hyatt Place  But no more  If there is a Hyatt Regency at 85  occupancy a couple miles less desirable and a Hyatt Place at 95  occupancy where it is most convenient for most travelers  you might find the Regency at  145 and the Hyatt Place at  245  Hyatt cannot train guests to believe in their  tiered pricing structure  then violate it whenever they can make an extra buck 
With this airline pricing of rooms  whatever the traffic will bear  which all chains use to a certain degree  Hyatt is making more money in the short term but destroying both guest loyalty and traveler certainty of finding no unwelcome surprises  More on all this when we come to the qualitative problems but first  the numbers  
Hyatt has also gotten deeply into the timeshare business  Some of our favorite old resorts that had the room to expand have seen the hotel on that property shrink and the timeshare  which Hyatt of course prefers to call the Hyatt Residence Club  take over many of the rooms   These are typically multi building properties or those with contiguous land available  
I understand the benefit of timeshares to the seller   you get a big chunk of cash up front and can then charge high maintenance fees  too  I understand the profit motive and certainly Hyatt is not alone  But the others with timeshare   vacation clubs  like Hilton and Marriott  are upgrading their hotel properties and loyalty programs as well 
It is in this last area that I see Hyatt really shooting itself in the foot  They have long had a fine loyalty program called  Gold Passport   In 2013  2014 and 2015 Hyatt was awarded the Freddie Award  see    despite the name  hoteliers and airlines take this award very seriously  for best Elite loyalty program  When you win something three years in a row  most people would enhance it or leave it the heck alone 
Not Hyatt  They completely revamped the program  They no longer have Silver  Gold and Diamond levels that have a reasonable frame of reference  The entry level is now  Discoverist   not a discoverer but a new made up word  Someone at Andaz must have dreamed this one up   Then one becomes  either by staying or by spending more money  an Explorist  Finally  by staying 60 nights per year or gaining  base points  by spending lots of money one becomes a Globalist 
As a Diamond member  one needed 28 separate stays  Nice and simple  And after achieving that level the frequent traveler received room upgrades as the staff had them available  a welcome amenity  like an appetizer or some such   breakfast for up to 4 persons  and a host of little favors like free newspapers  etc 
I am reminded of the tale of two girls working in a candy shop  One was always more popular than the other even though both had the same charming personality and dealt with customers the same way   except  Except that one girl would always over fill the whatever size  call it a half pound  of candy  then begin removing pieces to get back to one half pound  With each piece removed  the customer felt as if something was being taken away  The other girl would always under fill then  to the customers  delight  keep adding pieces  Both always sold exactly the same half pound 
Take note  Hyatt  You took away the welcome amenity  you took away the unexpected and delightful upgrades  you took away the morning paper  etc  And you replaced it with a program that rewards only those who choose to spend one sixth of every year in a hotel room  and not just any hotel  only your hotels   or those who choose to spend wildly on very high priced food  drink  spa treatments  etc  Present it any way you like  it is seen by the public that you only care about the money 
I am afraid for Hyatt s sake that I am not the only one who won t give my loyalty to any company that doesn t give loyalty in return  There was a conference call to sell this new program last year and management truncated it early because of the furor the changes caused  One of management s weak responses from taking the minimum number of nights to be a  Globalist  from 28 to 60 was that  at Marriott  you need 80 nights  What the senior mucky muck presenting the new program chose not to realize is that Marriott has nearly 10 times the locations  With Marriott  travelers can find numerous properties no matter where they are 
At Hyatt it seems  at least for their highest tier  they are only seeking expense account road warriors and not families on vacation  small and medium sized business owners who travel occasionally  or retirees looking to expand their horizons  The benefits that used to accrue to all those are now reserved for those on the road regularly and spending freely 
Of course  most of the time these road warriors are not people spending their own money like families and retirees and small business owners  They are instead on the corporate dime and the corporation has reached an agreement with Hyatt to offer special rates  Once you Pareto Principle yourself into fewer and fewer sources of income  what do you do when Big Company X with 14 000 traveling employees gets a better offer from another hotel chain  Hint  you might lose 14 000 guests with no personal loyalty to you all at once 
So  To answer the question I posed in the title  Is Hyatt Hotels a takeover target or just a short  I have no inside information  Personally  I would not consider shorting the stock  I think Hyatt s properties and reputation for excellence in service make them a juicy target for a competitor looking to extend its high end traveler portfolio
To stave off such a moment  the Board needs to shake things up  They do have some heavy hitters in their group and a second  and third generation Pritzker as well  The best time to shake things up was yesterday  The next best time is today  I will not buy Hyatt at its current price and current approach to meeting competitive threats  On a major pullback  thinking like an acquirer and wishing them the best  I certainly would 
PS    If you have your own favorite hotels in desirable travel locations or in business centers  let me know   I am now looking forward to trying new hotels that may be favorites of yours  as will other Investing com readers

11019,232534,WYND,Wyndham  WYN  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Wyndham Worldwide Corp   NYSE WYN   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 14  before the market opens 
A diversified product portfolio  effective marketing techniques and a robust loyalty program are likely to boost the company s top line in the to be reported quarter  However  effects of the recent hurricanes might have lingered in the fourth quarter and put pressure on earnings 
Meanwhile  shares of the company rallied 42 2  in the past year  outperforming the  s gain of 35 1  
Let s find out how the company s results will look like in the fourth quarter 
Factors Likely to Drive Revenues
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at  1 40 billion  reflecting 6 2  year over year growth  This growth is largely attributable to the company s strong presence across the globe that allows it to rake in additional revenues  The company s strong loyalty program also attracts customers and should aid the top line 
Through repeated acquisitions and divestitures  Wyndham is successfully expanding its presence worldwide and has further expansion plans for the Asia Pacific  Europe  Middle East  Africa and Indian Ocean  EMEAI  region  Meanwhile  the company also gains from the collaboration between its rental brands as they continue to expand on the cross selling of each other s product 
Also  it is continuously emphasizing on marketing campaigns and partnerships  digital experiences  website development  on property amenities and travel perks to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  To this end  Wyndham offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry that generates 64  additional revenues for its franchisees 
Moreover  Wyndham intends to keep boosting its strong proprietary distribution network through global partnerships with several industry leading online travel and vacation rental portals  These tools are expected to drive revenue in the to be reported quarter 
Earnings Likely to Raise Concern
The consensus estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at  1 35  in line with the prior year quarter s reported earnings  Notably  the company s predicted earnings in the to be reported quarter do not reflect the fruits of Wyndham s recent acquisition of AmericInnand its ongoing strategic initiative of expanding the number of new owners 
Although these efforts are slated to bring long term growth for the company  high costs associated with such initiatives might pose a concern for Wyndham s to be reported quarter s margins  This in turn might dent the company s fourth quarter earnings 
Moreover  management predicted the effects of the recent hurricanes to linger in the fourth quarter  affecting earnings 
Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a Beat

Adjusted earnings of  1 49 per share beat the consensus estimate of  1 35 by 10 4   Also  the bottom line was up 9 6  year over year on the back of higher revenues as well as the company s share repurchase program  partly offset by higher interest expenses

Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Wyndham had a great deal of benefit from the U S  corporate tax reform on fourth quarter earnings  The company s various sales building initiatives like marketing campaigns and partnerships  digital experiences  website development  on property amenities and travel perks to guests have favored earnings and revenues growth in the quarter  However  effects of the recent hurricanes lingered in the quarter  partially affecting both top and bottom lines

Fourth Quarter Unit Performances
Notably  Wyndham has been functioning through its three operating segments  Hotel Group  Destination Network  formerly known as Vacation Exchange and Rentals  and Vacation Ownership 
Hotel Group revenues were  332 million  up 5  from the year ago figure  which reflected higher franchise and royalty fees  increased pass through marketing  reservation as well as growth in Wyndham Rewards revenues 
Domestic same store RevPAR  revenues per available room  improved 4 5   At constant currency  global system wide same store RevPAR increased 4 6  year over year 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 3  to  102 million primarily due to revenue increases  partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Maria on the hotel in Puerto Rico

Revenues at the segment were  200 million  an increase of 5  from the year ago figure  While exchange revenues per member rose 7   the average number of members declined 1   The upside in exchange revenues was favored by pricing 
Adjusted EBITDA increased 23  to  48 million  reflecting cost savings initiatives and favorable pricing 
Revenues at Vacation Ownership increased 4  year over year to  734 million  The uptick reflects an increase in gross VOI sales as well as higher consumer financing revenues  even though hurricanes negatively impacted VOI sales in the quarter 
Gross VOI sales in the fourth quarter increased 7  from the year ago period  Meanwhile  tour flow was up 7  and volume per guest  VPG  increased 2  
Adjusted EBITDA increased 4 7  to  200 million  as higher gross VOI sales and consumer financing revenues were offset by a higher provision for loan losses

Balance Sheet
As of Dec 31  2017  net cash from continuing operations was  880 million  compared with  846 million in the prior year  The increase is primarily due to higher net income

2017 Results
For 2017  revenues from continuing operations were  5 1 billion  reflecting 3  year over year growth  The upside was offset by higher year over year interest  depreciation and variable compensation expenses  The recent hurricanes also affected revenues 
Adjusted EPS was  5 50 per share compared with  5 15 in 2016  The growth in adjusted EPS primarily reflected the repurchase of 6  of outstanding shares in the year      
2018 Guidance
Revenues are expected in the range of  5 26  5 40 billion  reflecting an increase of 4 6  
Adjusted net income from continuing operations is expected within  702  722 million  The company expects Adjusted EBITDA between  1 330 billion and  1 355 billion  reflecting year over year growth of 6 8

11023,232538,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry Outlook   February 2018,opinion,"The year 2017 favored the U S  hotel industry with moderate demand growth supporting increases in both occupancy and average daily rate  ADR  As a result  revenue per available room  RevPAR  witnessed a rise of 3  over 2016 
This is further reflected in the industry s stock price performance  Over the past year  the  has fared better than the broader S P 500 index  While the industry has gained 38 4   the broader index has added only 16 7  
With fourth quarter gross domestic product  GDP  growth remaining decent at 2 6   the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 3   better than the 1 5  growth rate recorded in 2016  We note that rising employment  higher real income  and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment  This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel  and higher transaction volumes  which are likely to continue 
Going forward  consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat  suggesting that the U S  economy will remain on solid footing for 2018  In fact  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 3 2   annualized rate  GDP growth in first quarter 2018 
However  peaking supply continues to be a meaningful downside risk and is expected to put pressure on the pricing power  thereby tempering the performance somewhat 
Number Crunching
Statistics underscore the expectation of moderating yet positiveperformance by the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  shows that new supply is likely to rise 1 9  in 2018  flat with 2017  This is likely to result in a 0 1  decline in occupancy rates in 2018 to 65 5  Though ADRand RevPAR are projected to climb 2 1  and 2   respectively this year  the rate of increase will be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years 
Meanwhile  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  rose 3 3  in December 2017  In fact  year to date  the index is up 32   Higher interest rates  tax reform and hurricane related demand tailwinds aided the outperformance 
Additionally  according to Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  U S  hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics  While overall occupancy at U S  hotels was up 1 4  year over year for the week ended Feb 3  2018  ADR rose 2 2   Resultantly  RevPAR grew 3 6  in the same time frame 
Ongoing Obstacles
Uncertainty  both international and domestic  may continue to weigh on the performance of the U S  lodging industry   Moreover  negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States given the Trump administration s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis detrimental to hotels 
While the anticipated weakening of U S  dollar could boost inbound international travel  it would then have a negative impact on domestic consumer spending  forcing consumers to shift discretionary spending Additionally  higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose  headwinds 
Meanwhile  hoteliers have been focusing on renovation  and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do so  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Moreover  high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers  and as they won t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like  their profits may be dented further  In fact  online travel agents like The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN   Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and TripAdvisor  TRIP  are also limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  and Marriott International  Inc   MAR   Notably  both companies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Potential Growth Drivers
The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions  So the present solid economic fundamentals that are likely to continue spurring consumer spending in 2018  raises optimism for hoteliers  Moreover  hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better  if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services 
Also  hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory  In fact  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  was being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 
In 2017  the hotel industry proved to be resilient to the marketplace shift  Going forward  too  the industry is expected to witness continued success 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking  especially among millennials  will remain the priorities  Acute  focused investment in infrastructure to attract more business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth

Earnings Trends
So far  the fourth quarter 2017 financial performance for hoteliers has been encouraging  While Hilton  Hyatt and Marriott surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues  Wyndham beat the consensus mark for earnings but missed on revenues marginally 
The Hotels   Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector  If we look at the overall results of the sector  earnings grew 0 9  in the September quarter while total revenues rose 3 5    Meanwhile  for the December quarter  though revenues are expected to rise 4 2   earnings are projected to record a decline of 0 5   For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our  
Conclusion
The U S  hotel industry has been benefiting from several factors like a strong economy  higher income  increased consumer confidence and a strong labor market  As people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points  companies in the space believe that their diverse portfolio of offerings can continue to deliver on this growing demand 
Consumer spending is expected to rise through 2018 backed by a favorable economic scenario  This raises optimism for companies in the leisure and recreation space  GDP grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the fourth quarter of 2017  following gains of more than 3  in the previous two quarters  per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
This marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009  Improving economic indicators bode well for the industry as these lead to an increase in leisure and business travel demand 
Meanwhile  consumer spending  the main engine of the economy  grew 3 8  in the fourth quarter after a 2 2  gain in the third  Again  there was a marked improvement in the Consumer Confidence Index in January  after a setback in December  Consumer Confidence rose 2 3 points to 125 4 in January  The momentum is expected to continue through 2018 
Thus  we see no reason why the industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom lines in the near to middle term  especially when the unemployment rate is at a 17 year low and wages are growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade

11049,232564,WYND,Will Airbnb Be The Biggest Tech Unicorn To IPO In 2018 ,opinion,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky  Joe Gebbia  and Nathan Blecharczyk  Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses  apartments  guest rooms  etc   on either platform  Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone 
Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have  With over 3 million listings worldwide including 1 400 castles it operates in over 65 000 cities and 191 countries  the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people 
Airbnb as a Lifestyle
Back in 2014  Airbnb announced a huge  company wide rebranding  indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand  Since its inception  it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option  taking on big industry names like Wyndham   NYSE WYN    Hyatt   NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide   NYSE H    and InterContinental Hotels   NYSE IHG   
But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more  In a   the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products  houses  and businesses  to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal but  more importantly  a supporter of their brand 
Dubbed B lo  its logo is a symbol of belonging  While it may look like a misshapen paperclip  B lo is a  symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences  new cultures  and new conversations   Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app  which are now far cleaner than previous versions  and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery 
Controversies to Consider
Airbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry  but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels  reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber 
In San Francisco  critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over  3 900 average monthly rent  Average home prices in the city recently hit the  1 1 million median mark  and San Francisco s population has reached an all time high  according to Paragon Real Estate Group 
Despite the absence of a permit  which  according to law  one must have in order to rent for under 30 days  San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb  And  legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city  most likely hindering a person s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forward
The company is also embroiled in a long standing battle with New York City  where they face similar issues as in San Francisco  Last fall  the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal  which  not surprisingly  thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market 
Shortly after  Gov  Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law  with politicians  local hoteliers  and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory  Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York   To avoid fees  hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses  not their entire apartment     while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected 
But Airbnb s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the  AirbnbWhileBlack controversy  which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color  Airbnb admitted that a problem exists  and at the time  said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests  and by responding to concerns they raise 
Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference  CEO Chesky said that  We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue   Chesky said   There were lots of things we didn t think about when we  as three white guys  designed the platform  
IPO Buzz
Since 2014  and regardless of its fight with certain cities  rumors have been swirling of Airbnb s inevitable initial public offering  even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal  Chesky said that  we will do it at a time when it benefits the company  when we have a good reason  
Airbnb s last valuation clocked in at  31 billion it s worth only about  15 billion less than Marriot   NASDAQ MAR   thanks to its  of equity funding  making it the second most valuable U S  startup behind Uber  This  as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy  is helping raise buzz  Their popularity among venture capitalists  VCs  is helping increase hype  too 
However  this new round of funding  in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy  200 million in stock from Airbnb employees  could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO  Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash  allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public 
Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify  and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take  According to   Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify s unconventional plans  Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding  also read   
This move benefits private companies who don t need cash   but want a way for employees  founders  and other shareholders to start trading their shares    
How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform 
Thanks to Snap Inc  s   NYSE SNAP    last March  the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb  and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year 
Like other tech companies  Airbnb is a company for the digital age  and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success  Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years specifically  in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service 
Particularly  Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run  it doesn t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff  The company is also easy to grow quickly  as there is no need for a physical office in every country  just consumers with a smartphone 
Like any tech startup  Airbnb s IPO will be a toss up  Its valuation is impressive in and of itself  and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market  Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition  Companies like     and the Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  owned  all have a dedicated following of their own  and are all beginning to eat into the market share 
Despite rival companies and regulatory issues  Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs  With billions of dollars in investments already  a thriving rebranding  and its rising popularity among travelers  Airbnb s IPO is one to watch out for

11050,232565,WYND,Marriott  MAR  Rides On Starwood Buyout   Solid Expansion,opinion,Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   is poised to grow in the near as well as long term  given a steady rise in business and leisure travel Last week  the company posted better than expected third quarter 2017 results wherein both the bottom and top lines outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  for 2017  Marriott anticipates earnings in the band of  4 22 to  4 24 per share  up from the earlier guided range of  4 06 to  4 18 We note that after the acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts on Sep 23  2016  Marriott has become the world s largest hotel company  Currently  it has more than 6 400 properties across 126 countries and territories  under 30 brand names Post acquisition of Starwood  shares of the company have surged 75 9  while the broader S P 500 index gained 19   After sorting out its integration challenges  Marriott s shares are well poised to continue growing  as and when positive synergies are realized    Additionally  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company continues to reflect strength in several areas  Therefore  it is expected to continue performing well in the quarters ahead  You can see  Key Growth DriversAttractive Brand Position  Acquisitions to Drive Growth  Marriott s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allow it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry  Given its property locations  we believe that the company is well poised to benefit from the increasing market demand backed by stepped up business as well as leisure traveling in major North American and international locations Meanwhile  with the completion of the Starwood acquisition  Marriott s distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East   Africa combined  In fact  the buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run Interestingly  even with 30 brands under portfolio  the company has not ruled out further M A activities  It holds about 14 15  market share in the United States and therefore has further room to grow Robust Expansion Plans  In addition to domestic markets  Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in international markets  Going forward  the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands  Also  it anticipates gross room additions of 7  in 2018 that is likely to continue building economics  scale and consumer preference for its brands Outside the United States  the hotel giant is trying to expand its footprint  especially in Asia  Latin America  Middle East and Africa  In fact  Marriott s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue  going forward Within Asia Pacific  China promises immense growth potential despite the economic slowdown  In fact  in August 2017  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  to develop a travel storefront that leverage the latter s digital travel platform  retail expertise and digital payment platform  Alipay Notably  China is the largest source market for outbound travel now  In fact  Chinese outbound travel is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years  As a result  Marriott expects this new joint venture to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market  increase membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs  Apart from China  the company continues to focus on other Asian countries like India  Indonesia  Thailand and Australia for further expansion We expect the company s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well Embracing Social Media and Smartphones to Build Loyalty   Digital innovations and social media have already started playing an important role in hotel bookings  Marriott too has rolled out guestVoice to measure guest feedback  introduced SPG Mobile check in and check out in North America  and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings Additionally  post its acquisition of Starwood  Marriott has linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community  In fact  the company aims to merge its loyalty programs into one by 2018 These investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses  Well  not really Lingering political uncertainties in key international markets along with currency headwinds remain concerns for Marriott and most of the other hotel chains including Hyatt Hotels Corporation   NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide Holdings   NYSE H   and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation   NYSE WYN   Still  we believe that the company s unmatched portfolio of lodging brands  strong global footprint along with an increased demand for travel will pave the way for its growth  going forward Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Royal Caribbean s current year s earnings has moved up 2 4   reflecting nine upward revisions versus none downwards  Also  next year s earnings estimates have inched up 2 1  on the back of nine upward revisions versus no downward revision All these positive earnings estimate revisions testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and further adds to the optimism in the stock Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the

11051,232566,WYND,Think Hotel Stocks Are Hot  Read This Before You  Book In  ,opinion,"Hotel stocks have risen in anticipation of increased business and leisure travel in 2018
But there are hotel owners  hotel managers  and hotel brands often   ne er the twain shall meet 
Which are good buys in spite of the run up 
Here is my favorite hotel pick   with more to follow in Part II

When most Americans think of hotels  they think of the most familiar names where  on land  they can get a room for the night or longer  Hotels mean temporary shelter  rooms with a very short minimum rental period to a maximum of staying forever  Most of them have already risen mightily this year 
But here s a slightly different take on what constitutes  lodging  courtesy of Forbes  2017 version of The World s Biggest Public Companies  as measured by an amalgam of sales  profits  assets and market value 

The 270th biggest company in the world  and the  1 company listed under the  Hotels   Motels  category  does not provide land based rooms at all  Who is it  Carnival  LON CCL  Corp  CCL  which controls not just the estimable Carnival Cruise Lines but also all these independently operated lines as well   Think Berkshire Hathaway s limited hands on approach to its many subsidiaries  In cruise industry terms  each line appeals to a different demographic and psychographic  

There is a certain logic to considering Carnival the world s largest hotelier  After all  with the exception of repositioning cruises and those featuring extended sea time  your cruise includes a fine hotel room  from which you never have to unpack for the duration of your travels  in some of the world s great destinations  Add up the cost of hotels in those cities and smaller venues  dining out every day and getting transportation arranged for whatever excursions you are taking and you may well conclude that it is not only cheaper than staying in land hotels  it is also less enervating 
There are even those who suggest that  as long as you don t need regular medical care but are still considering moving to one of those buy your own apartments at a care facility where meals and regular housekeeping as well as movies and other entertainment and fitness classes and facilities are provided  you might consider perennial cruising instead  Done right  it can be cheaper and the views more interesting 
But that s an article for another time  Besides  much as I like to buy the cruise lines as a trade whenever they are depressed  they are not depressed today  They have moved up as a bloc along with the market so I can t find compelling value here  For now we ll start our exploration of the  hotel industry  with the 467th biggest publicly traded global company and the biggest land based hotel  According to Forbes  that would be Marriott International  NASDAQ MAR  
Not bad for a company that began as a nine seat A W root beer stand in Washington D C  Today Marriott boasts more than 6 000 hotels with 1 1 million rooms in more than 120 countries  But when they say they  offer  these rooms you ll notice they don t say they  own  these rooms  They do own some of them  but therein lies the great lesson of how hotels really work 

You look at all these names above and wonder how any company could keep track of them all  It looks more like a conglomerate than a hotelier  But like Carnival and all the other lodging and travel specialists  Marriott realizes that the demographics and psychographics that draw travelers to one or a handful of hotels time and again require this kind of diversification  Budget travelers need the certainty of knowing they will be well served along their way  business travelers demand something very different  those who have struggled and achieved much feel they deserve something still different  and so on 
It would be quite difficult to stay on top of all this if Marriott owned all these hotels  or tried to apply one particular management style to all of them  That is precisely why they typically do not even attempt to do so  Some hotels are owned  managed and branded by the same company  The J W  Marriott in D C  and the Key Bridge Marriott just a few miles away in Rosslyn VA  where I stayed on many a temporary duty at the Pentagon and other sites around D C  are examples of how hotels used to do things  Both are company owned  managed and branded 
But the kind of debt a company would have to take on to buy the properties  and the different kinds of management each demographic might require  means that today when a company talks about its properties  as likely as not most if not all of those properties are owned by someone else or managed by someone else 
You see  hotels can be independently owned and operated managed  But these days you need to be a legendary name with a robust clientele who embrace the hotel with every succeeding generation or the only hotel in town to be able to carry on the Grand Hotel tradition or the you need a place to stay  here we are tradition 
Hotels can be independently owned but leased to an operator manager  These may be further divided into those that choose to remain independent  those that share a common reservation system a la Best Western but are otherwise dissimilar  and those in which the manager decides to affiliate with a chain  In this model  a real estate investment trust  REIT  or a pension fund or a professional association of wealthy doctors or lawyers or such buy a property but don t have the time or the inclination to manage it  Instead they hire a firm that does all the hiring  firing  cleaning  maintenance  security  and all the other things that go into running a hotel   including deciding whether it is worthwhile to affiliate with one of the major chains 
As noted above hotels can be owned  operated and branded by a chain  The J W  is an example of this approach   owned  operated and branded with the chain s imprimatur 
Hotels can be franchised by one of the major chains  Here again there can be disparate paths taken  the franchisee might be a management company that manages for many unrelated hotel owners or the franchisee might be the owners themselves who elect to hire the chain s management team or an entirely different one  This is the path pioneered on a large scale by Kemmons Wilson  who started Holiday Inn back in 1952 and began offering franchises on his Holiday Inns in the early 1960s  Since then  this has become  especially recently  the favorite way for chain hotel brands to run their businesses 
Why has franchising become so much more attractive to the big hotel chains   These are also sometimes called  branders  but most frequently referred to as  flags   probably because the big chains  marketing  loyalty programs  advertising and logos all set each apart in the same way that a nation s flag does  
The reason is simple  back in the day when hotels were few and far between it wasn t that difficult to set your hotel apart  But today building hotels takes a whole lot of money as land has become less available and more expensive and a whole lot of time dealing with building departments  zoning issues  construction crews and so on 
So if a flag hotel company can simply license out its benefits to an existing property owner  or a group willing to deal with all those local issues when building a new hotel  they can simply can take a percent of the income  This relieves them from having to borrow money  or take the risks of cost overruns or neighborhood opposition  Mostly it means they suffer far less when occupancy declines  as they did during the recent unpleasantness of 2007 2009 and the long road back since that occurred 
Again using Marriott as an example  though it might as well be all the other major flag chains as well  you ll note that just  1   of Marriott s hotels are company owned or leased 

This model lets the flags plant their flag in a whole lot of new destinations and grow their share of mind with travelers who continue to see that flag popping up whenever they travel  This is especially beneficial to the big flags because  on their own  they might not consider the risk reward to be favorable if opening in smaller demographic areas  As long as someone else is paying the freight  it bodes well for continued consolidation 
Marriott and Hilton  NYSE HLT  have done particularly well with this model  leapfrogging much of the competition  Hyatt  NYSE H  has joined this party late and is trying valiantly to keep up with having many different  brands  under its Hyatt logo   I ll be writing about Hyatt s success or failure in my next article on this subject   Franchising also means that the flags can take a risk on a rather small hotel in terms of number of rooms and amenities  a risk they certainly would not take if they were paying in time and money to create a presence in these Tier 2 and 3 markets 
In a nutshell  for the big flags the logic is that it is better to get 10  of the gross income from 2000 properties than 100  from 50 properties   while taking on virtually 0  of the risk in the former example and 100  of the risk in the latter 
What s in it for the hotel owners who took all or almost all the risk  The big flags use their  known product  status  their reservation systems  their advertising and marketing  their hospitality training and their loyalty programs to deliver far more guests to hotels that would otherwise have to scream and shout on expedia com  hotels com  booking com and all the rest of those sorts of sites  The fees from these sites would be as much or more as the franchise fees and the hotel owners would be unlikely to get the loyalty program guests from the flags  100  occupancy is the goal  The big flags come closest to delivering that 
If this is the case  who then are the real hotel owners  Most often they are real estate investment trusts  REITs  or other real estate companies that are the experts in site selection  negotiating price  arranging financing and dealing with local building codes and construction firms  This reveals yet another benefit to the actual hotel owner of allying in advance with a flag hotel company  it is much easier to attract investors or appeal to lenders if they know that your hotel will come under the umbrella of a well known and dependable flag 
Referring back to the Forbes list of big hotel companies  above  
 Hilton  HLT  is the 2nd biggest flag  Like Marriott  it s rapid rise this year has made it somewhat less compelling as a buy  Still  on any pullback  Hilton is my  1 choice  My bias comes from many years of close affiliation and hundreds of stays  I have been a HiltonHonors  loyalty program  member for more than 30 years and that has earned me luxurious stays at a number of Waldorf Astorias and Conrads  on points  of course   I ve had truly memorable stays around the world at the Conrads in Cairo and Singapore  the Waldorf Astorias in New York  Phoenix  Key West  La Quinta and New Orleans and countless stellar Hiltons from Paris to Bangkok 
I ve also stayed at a lot more Hamptons  Hilton Garden Inns and the rest of the less expensive Hilton properties around the world in order to earn those points  The attraction of Hilton as an investment is that they have been brilliant not only in segmenting the market but have been very clever in their geographic dispersion as well  Some of the smallest towns along well traveled roads midway between two destinations will have a Hampton Inn  Hilton Garden Inn  or even a Doubletree or Embassy Suites from time to time  Hilton makes it easy to be an HHonors member and very fair in rewarding their members with incredible stays in incredible places   Ditto for Hyatt  not big enough to make this list  but I ll cover Hyatt in Part II of this look at hotels and hoteliers  
Next is Shenzhen Overseas  SZ 000069   China  which does not trade in the US 
Then comes Oriental Land  T 4661   also known as OLC Group  US ADR symbol is  OTC OLCLY    I like the company just fine but it isn t a pure play hotel company  Even though Forbes ranks it as the 1180th largest company in the world  it derives more of its revenue from its primary sources of income  the management of Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea  the only ocean themed Disney park in the world  and other travel and leisure subsidiaries  Hotels  including an under construction Hyatt Regency beach resort on Okinawa  account for just 13  of earnings  Still  on a pullback I ll likely revisit this one  Disney never goes out of style 
Next is Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  which claims on its website 

 There s no one else like us  Wyndham Hotel Group is the world s largest and most diverse hotel business  with a global portfolio of more than 8 100 hotels and over 705 700 rooms in 79 countries  

It is diverse though not nearly as profitable as the ones mentioned above  Most of its properties are of the limited service variety like Days Inn  Travelodge  and Ramada but it also has Wyndham  Wyndham Grand and Dolce under its wing  Having risen from  3 dollars and change in 2009  it is now  112  where it sells at a reasonable 20 times earnings  My biggest concern here is that as deeper pocketed Marriott acquires more Fairfield Inns and Hilton does the same with its Hampton Inns  Wyndham s properties will likely need significant renovation and upgrading to compete 
Intercontinental Hotels  NYSE IHG  is the now British owned parent of Holiday Inns  It would take a book to track all the different buys  sells  buybacks  and so on that led to the current structure  Here s what it looks like today 

Add to these the upscale Kimpton brand   Thanks to the wonders of modern website animation    never let a pair of eyeballs rest or  God forbid  leave    I was unable to capture the current roster   Now IHG  too  spans the spectrum from limited service to extended stay to mid range to full service to luxury  just like MAR and HLT have  I see the investment case here as ranking just under Hilton 
Finally     and still among the Forbes 2000 is Accor Hotels  PA ACCP   France   US ADR   OTC ACCYY    Accor has brought segmentation to a whole new level  I have had truly memorable stays with Accor   the Sofitel Saigon comes immediately to mind  and yes  I still call it Saigon   The Fairmont Olympic in Seattle is no slouch either  But I ve had some of the worst stays with Accor while trying to save money at their spartan F1 and  Ibis Budget  brands   calling to advise I d be late  assured it was no problem  then finding they d given my room away  etc 
I won t let those experiences sour my opinion of the company s prospects  however  They re doing some really smart things  Taking the Marriott  Hyatt and Hilton vacation timeshares  oops  The industry prefers  VOCs    Vacation Ownership Clubs  to the next logical step  Accor has an extensive network of private villas  city apartments and beachside homes they have assembled  mostly for 3 night or longer stays  
These are all very high end places so Airbnb needn t panic just yet  Airbnb has a few showcase offerings but by and large they compete more for budget conscious travelers  Of course  the margins on Accor s top drawer properties are significantly better than those Airbnb and the various vacation rental sites will see   In Part II  I will discuss the threat possibly posed to the hotel industry from Airbnb  VRBO Homeaway and other  alternative lodging  players  
It is possible  of course  that Accor is cannibalizing its own upscale hotel clients with this move  I guarantee the other big flags are watching closely but haven t yet moved in this direction  If it turns out that all Accor has done is lower the occupancy of its Fairmont  Sofitel and other luxury brands this will all have come to naught 

The other problem with Accor is that it is French  That means it is saddled with French rules and regulations and a government that has traditionally strived for full employment or at least the appearance thereof and in so doing made it nearly impossible to fire bad employees  Previous French president Francois Hollande carried on in this socialist tradition with gusto  It remains to be seen if current president  since May 2017  Emmanuel Macron will reverse this trend  As evidence of the problem  revenue per employee at Accor is higher than at most of its competitors 
Even so I see the possibility of good things happening for Accor  If I were looking purely at the numbers   PE  Price Book  Price Sales  Price Free Cash Flow  EV EBITDA  Cash Debt  ROIC  etc   I would select IHG as the  current  best buy of the above  If I were looking purely at my personal experience with all these and my gut feel for how successful I think they will execute  it would be HLT 
But for the best combination of both right now I am going with Accor  For US citizens I suggest the ADRs for your due diligence   if you buy now  these are selling for just under  10 US  I believe Accor has segmented the market well  is particularly strong internationally  where I see the greatest growth prospects  and is gaining a first mover advantage in taking on Airbnb  VRBO et al head on  It should be an interesting battle 
I will publish Part II later this week  right after Christmas  In it I will discuss publicly traded alternative lodging choices  like Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   parent of Homeaway and VRBO   one flag hotel I see as flagging and want to warn you about  and my favorite way to play continued success at Hilton without buying Hilton stock 
I welcome your comments and questions and I wish you a wonderful holiday    and good investing 
Disclosure  Do your due diligence  What s right for me may not be right for you  what s right for you may not be right for me  Past performance is no guarantee of future results  Rather an obvious statement  but too many people look only at past performance instead of seeking the alpha that comes from solid research and due diligence ",2017-12-24,Joseph L.

11053,232568,WYND,Can Hotel Companies Survive Airbnb   This One Will,opinion,"Hotel investors anticipate increased business and leisure travel in an improving economy this coming year  But Airbnb  Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP   Priceline  NASDAQ PCLN  and the rest of the alternative lodging purveyors may pose a serious threat
Which publicly traded  lodging  companies will survive  Which will thrive 
Last week I published an article   novella on Investing com as Part I of this series on the lodging industry  Hot Hotel Stocks  Look Before You Leap  
I recommend you read that first article in order to see just how hotels are typically owned  managed and marketed  It isn t what most people assume  Part I provides the background in which hotels operate  company owned  managed and branded  investor group owned  externally managed and externally branded  franchised  etc  In it I also discuss how the industry is rapidly evolving  and provide my investment suggestions for your further due diligence  When you return to this Part II article  begin here 
All hotel stocks have performed well in 2017  That was not just the rising boat phenomenon of a good market  it was outsized performance that beat the market as a result of investor expectation of rising business and leisure travel in 2018  But we cannot assume that all travelers will select traditional hotels  Nor can we any longer assume that the hotel owners and or managers and or branders the  flag  companies like Marriott  NASDAQ MAR   Hilton  NYSE HLT   and Hyatt  NYSE H  will be as profitable given increased competition for the traveler s dollar 
The first assault has come from the online travel agencies  OTAs  like Hotels com  Booking com  Priceline  PCLN   Expedia  EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and the rest of the aggregators of hotels  motels  B Bs and other traditional lodging  Hotel owner managers  if they are independent  or managers  if they represent owners  tend to have a love hate relationship with such sites 
On the one hand  no owner or manager wants to see a hotel room that has cost money to market  maintain and clean remain vacant  The Pricelines and Expedias of this brave new world help fill those rooms   for a fee that cuts into the hoteliers  bottom line  of course  On the other hand  better to pay 10  of something than get 100  of nothing 
I use Priceline  TripAdvisor and Expedia as examples because these three now control  via aggressive acquisition  much of the industry  For instance  Expedia owns Expedia com  Hotels com  Hotwire com  trivago  Venere com  cheaptickets  hotwire  vacationrentals com  Travelocity  Orbitz  VRBO and HomeAway 
Priceline owns Priceline  Booking com  Kayak com and many others that are not hotel related but which refer from cheapflights com  rentalcars com  Open Table  etc  to suggest a hotel vacation 
TripAdvisor owns  again  not all hotel related but all will link to lodging sites  Airfarewatchdog  BookingBuddy  Citymaps  Cruise Critic  Family Vacation Critic  FlipKey  GateGuru  Holiday Lettings  Independent Traveler  Jetsetter  OneTime  SeatGuru  SmarterTravel  Tingo  VacationHomeRentals  Viator  and Virtual Tourist 

Most of these travel sites will funnel travelers to lodging sites  Graphic courtesy of tnooz com
These various sites dilute the likelihood that a hotel website will gather 100  of the  eyeballs  when trying to get the attention of the traveling public  Especially if they believe they are in the  hotel business  rather than the more complex  guest hosting business  then they will rapidly fall behind in the basic technological and cost saving appeal of the OTAs 
It is not that deep pocketed owners  management firms and  flags   the big chain names  cannot compete in this crowded field  it is instead a matter of how profitable they can be and how much of their gross revenue can be brought down to the bottom line  But many believe there is a greater threat to the hotel industry than the online travel agencies 
What if people simply stopped staying at hotels  That would be a different matter  And that is the concern engendered by the entry of Airbnb and its newer competitors as well as by the many  vacation rental by owner  companies like Expedia s VRBO and HomeAway and TripAdvisor s FlipKey 
Speaking from personal experience  I own a 2500 square foot home in the Florida Keys with a dock and all the amenities that I rent for barely more than a mere hotel room  I ve also rented as a guest through many of these organizations and found the same to be true  On a recent trip to Venice  my wife and I stayed in a beautiful apartment with a full kitchen not a block from the Piazza San Marco for less than  175  Hotel rooms in the area start at  450 a night 
How do hotels fight back against such incursions  Sometimes they offer more amenities  a pool  room service  excursions  or something else 
Sometimes they are a bit more under handed and fight back through local regulators  In the case of the Florida Keys they seem to have some county commissioners who are  shall we say  surprisingly like minded  In the unincorporated parts of the Keys  a homeowner cannot rent their home for less than 30 days without incurring massive fines  This benefits the hotel industry but the same county government can t figure out why tourism is down 
Absent the heavy hand of local government  is Airbnb and the vacation rental businesses a serious threat to the hotel industry 
In some ways  yes  But in the most important ways I believe there is plenty of room for both approaches  Not everyone is willing to go online  read the reviews on places they have never seen  compare properties and prices  and make their decision  Not when they know what they are going to get when they select a no surprises Holiday Inn or Hilton Garden Inn or Marriott 
The argument in favor of Airbnb and its copycats is that it is growing by leaps and bounds and is therefore on track to replace hotels  That s a particularly egregious case of linear thinking  In fact  it is likely there is room for growth for both  Airbnb grew its revenues in 2017 but so did the entire hotel industry  And Airbnb provides a different kind of a stay    it generally attracts a guest who demands little more than a bed  some privacy and wifi  With some fine Airbnb exceptions  hotels provide a greater level of customer service and reliability of what the traveler expects and receives 
Then there are the travelers who aren t commuting from one place to another  nor are they seeking to stay in a city singly or as a couple or family to explore its attractions  They are there for conferences  banquets  weddings or other group get togethers  There are some I suppose who might tell their wedding guests to check out places within x miles on Airbnb but that sort of civility is hopefully far in the future 
The argument has also been made that competition from Airbnb et al is forcing room rates down for the hotel industry  If that is true I sure haven t seen it  Hotel rates are up  Airbnb rates are up and vacation rental rates are up 
Hotel owners understand that there are ups and downs in room occupancy and tend to have credit lines available and do other strategic planning for the tougher times  They are also willing to lower their rates even below the profitability level to at least defray some of the downside if necessary 
I think the owners listing on Airbnb would be reluctant to offer their homes and apartments for less than they are now getting  They won t have the flexibility the more experienced hoteliers have over many years of good and bad times  Nor will they be as happy with Airbnb  which will likely be a public company then and under the gun to show increasing earnings even if it means increasing their fees on the owners 
Then  too  many hotels are noting the things that some travelers like about Airbnb and adopting some of its best practices  The big flag chains have the deep pockets to experiment and  if it works for them  create a closer to Airbnb experience   rooms that are more individualized  providing a private entry  adding kitchens or simply buying vacation rental chains or building their own inventory 
Accor  PA ACCP   OTC ACCYY   which I am buying as a result of my research for Part I of this series  is leading this charge internationally and has the ability to maintain standards of inspection and maintenance that are likely to exceed those Airbnb can impose upon its independent owners 
There s another issue with the peer to peer economy that Airbnb is a leading part of  security  As the spate of allegations against Uber drivers shows  physical security is an aspect of the sharing economy too often overlooked  If a single traveler books a room in someone s home they are staying where someone else has a key and that someone else may not live by the same moral code travelers expect  This may be even more the case in international travel to offbeat locations  When a traveler checks in to a respected flag hotel they kow they can expect either on site security or a staff well trained to summon local authorities immediately 
Finally there are the hotel loyalty programs  As I just did on a recent road trip  I can stay at the Hampton Inn in Gainesville GA  the Embassy Suites in Concord NC  the Hilton Garden Inn in Woodbridge VA  and the Home2Suites back in Charlotte NC  then use the points I earned to stay for free at the Conrad in Singapore or the Waldorf in New Orleans  I don t see the loose confederation of owners at Airbnb or even looser confederation at HomeAway submitting to lower rates in order to create a loyalty program for Airbnb or Expedia 
Bottom line   I believe hotels are here to stay  When I say  hotels  I include all three parties that make for most successful hotels today  the hotel owners  the hotel managers  and the big flag chains that provide quality control and consistent levels of desired experience 
I think flag chains may one day replace at least some of the hotel management companies  Marriott  Hilton  InterContinental Hotels  NYSE IHG   Wyndham  NYSE WYN   Hyatt  Accor and the others can afford to offer their management at a competitive rate and that gives the actual hotel owners one less outside party to negotiate with  Most flags are selling at a price I am unwilling to pay right now  except for Accor  but I believe every one of them will continue to aggregate brands  innovate with unique hospitality offerings  and survive and thrive 
Even Hyatt  which will be the primary subject of Part III of this series and the flag chain I  until recently  held in greatest regard and to which I gave my greatest loyalty  is likely to survive the current management blunders  I think the brand will survive and the nonpareil training will be restored  but I imagine it will likely be as part of a larger company  Only under a larger umbrella might we see a rebranding of the Hyatt limited service offerings with a new emphasis on the Hyatt luxury and premium properties  In short  I think Hyatt might be an ideal acquisition target 
But that s another article  For now  however  let me review a true hotel  owner  that I can strongly recommend  albeit one most people have never heard of 
Park Hotels   Resorts  NYSE PK  owns properties   and not just any properties  It was formed just under a year ago  on January 3rd  2017  when Hilton  HLT   one of the forward leaning innovators in the travel and lodging industry  decided to focus on management and branding and leave the ownership of the land and buildings to someone else  Hilton spun off an amazing portfolio of company owned properties  to newly formed Park Hotels   Resorts  retaining management and branding and gaining substantial investor capital to continue its growth 
I consider the spun off properties some of the crown jewels of the lodging business  Currently Park owns 67 hotels with over 35 000 rooms  lots of irreplaceable land  and significant conference and meeting space  These properties are premium branded  accessible to Hilton guests  loyalty awards program HHonors  and mostly in the USA  More than 50 of the company s 67 hotel properties are clearly in the  luxury  or  upscale  category  which allows Park to receive significantly higher room  event and conference rates 
The company has at least one hotel in 14 of the top 25 U S  travel markets  mostly in central business districts  key on airport hotels or in highly desirable resort locations  The total current value of these properties is somewhere north of  9 billion 
Among its always popular business  convention and central city tourist destination hotels are 

  The Hilton New York Midtown
  The Hilton Chicago
  The Hilton San Francisco Union Square
  Parc 55 San Francisco
  The Capital Hilton Washington DC
  The Embassy Suites Georgetown  Washington D C  
  The Embassy Suites Kansas City
  The Embassy Suites Austin Downtown
  The Embassy Suites Alexandria Old Town
  The Hilton New Orleans Riverside
  The Hilton Orlando  x2 
  The Hilton Salt Lake  and the
  The Hilton San Diego  Bayfront 

Park s resort properties  from west to east  are familiar names as well 

  Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki
  Hilton Waikoloa Village  Big Island 
  Hilton La Jolla   Torrey Pines
  The Fess Parker Hotel Santa Barbara
  Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak  Phoenix 
  The Doubletree Durango
  The Hilton Orlando
  Waldorf Astoria Orlando
  Casa Marina  Waldorf Astoria  Key West  and
  The Reach  Waldorf Astoria  Key West

In addition to all these signature properties  PK also owns 26 premier major airport and attraction based hotels and 14 international hotels  of which 8 are in the United Kingdom  All in all  an amazing portfolio 
However  a fine portfolio is not reason enough for me to select an investment  I can enjoy their properties without buying their stock  But I like the company s prospects for increased revenue and earnings  which means I like the stock as well 
Park has no obligation to acquire additional Hilton properties or to keep any particular Hilton property  It is a company that stands on its own  beholden to no particular flag  The company has  I believe wisely  elected to hire Hilton to manage their current properties  assuring them of continued competitiveness in attracting Hilton s 73 million HHonors loyalty members 
Nevertheless  going forward management has stated quite clearly that they plan to  employ an active capital recycling program    expanding our presence in target markets with a focus on brand and operator diversification  while reducing exposure to slower growth assets markets  This is the foundation for their strategic planning  I expect to see them sell some of their less premium properties and reallocate the funds to higher end hotels 
Further  Park has inherited the benefit of Hilton s devotion to maintenance  upgrading and remodeling   1 5 billion has been spent since 2011 to keep these hotels fresh and attractive  That s more than  44 000 per room 
Park has done a fine job of showing why it plans to diversify managers and brands and which ones they find most desirable in a single graphic  If all hotel owners  and managers and flags  hewed to these principles I believe they would all do well 

I purchased shares of Park Hotels   Resorts on Friday for myself and clients

11067,232582,WYND,Will Airbnb Be The Next Tech Unicorn To IPO ,opinion,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky  Joe Gebbia  and Nathan Blecharczyk  Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses  apartments  guest rooms  etc   on either platform  Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone 
Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have  With over 3 million listings worldwide including 1 400 castles it operates in over 65 000 cities and 191 countries  the company has a total guest list of more than 150 million people 
Airbnb as a Lifestyle
Back in 2014  Airbnb announced a huge  company wide rebranding  indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand  Since its inception  it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option  taking on big industry names like Wyndham   NYSE WYN    Hyatt   NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide   NYSE H    and InterContinental Hotels   NYSE IHG   
But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more  In a   the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products  houses  and businesses  to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal but  more importantly  a supporter of their brand 
Dubbed B lo  its logo is a symbol of belonging  While it may look like a misshapen paperclip  B lo is a  symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences  new cultures  and new conversations   Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app  which are now far cleaner than previous versions  and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery 
Controversies to Consider
Airbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry  but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels  reflecting similar problems that plague companies like Uber 
In San Francisco  critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over  3 900 average monthly rent  Average home prices in the city recently hit the  1 1 million median mark  and San Francisco s population has reached an all time high  according to Paragon Real Estate Group 
Despite the absence of a permit  which  according to law  one must have in order to rent for under 30 days  San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb  And recently  legislation was approved in San Francisco last June that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city  most likely hindering a person s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forward
The company is also embroiled in a long standing battle with New York City  where they face similar issues as in San Francisco  Last fall  the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal  which  not surprisingly  thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand its market 
Shortly after  Gov  Andrew Cuomo signed that bill into law  with politicians  local hoteliers  and affordable housing advocates hailing the decision as a victory  Some have calculated that the law has deleted roughly half of Airbnb listings in New York   To avoid fees  hosts in large apartment buildings can only rent rooms or beds in their houses  not their entire apartment     while hosts who rent entire homes or row houses will not be affected 
But Airbnb s biggest challenge may have been dealing with the  AirbnbWhileBlack controversy  which was a recent protest movement against multiple instances of the company s hosts apparently declining guests due to skin color  Airbnb admitted that a problem exists  and at the time  said it was trying to tackle the problem by educating hosts and guests  and by responding to concerns they raise 
Commenting at the 2016 Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference  CEO Chesky said that  We were so focused on creating trust and safety that we took our eye off the ball on this other important issue   Chesky said   There were lots of things we didn t think about when we  as three white guys  designed the platform  
IPO Buzz
Since 2014  and regardless of its fight with certain cities  rumors have been swirling of Airbnb s inevitable initial public offering  even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal  Chesky said that  we will do it at a time when it benefits the company  when we have a good reason  
Airbnb s last valuation clocked in at  31 billion it s worth only about  11 billion less than Marriot   NASDAQ MAR   thanks to its  of equity funding  making it the second most valuable U S  startup behind Uber  This  as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and sharing economy  is helping raise buzz  Their popularity among venture capitalists  VCs  is helping increase hype  too 
However  this new round of funding  in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy  200 million in stock from Airbnb employees  could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO  Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash  allowing it to spend enough and continue its global expansion without going public 
Airbnb is also reportedly watching fellow tech unicorn Spotify  and what IPO route the music streaming giant will take  According to   Airbnb may want to mimic Spotify s unconventional initial public offering plans  Spotify is planning to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange without raising a new round of funding  also read   
This move benefits private companies who don t need cash   but want a way for employees  founders  and other shareholders to start trading their shares    
How Might an Airbnb IPO Perform 
Thanks to Snap Inc  s   NYSE SNAP    just a few months ago  the spotlight is shining with renewed intensity on startups like Airbnb  and investors are wondering if the online hospitality marketplace will file for an IPO this year 
Like other tech companies  Airbnb is a company for the digital age  and many are wanting to be the first ones to invest in its expected success  Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years specifically  in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service 
Particularly  Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run  it doesn t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff  The company is also easy to grow quickly  as there is no need for a physical office in every country  just consumers with a smartphone 
Like any tech startup  Airbnb s IPO will be a toss up  Its valuation is impressive in and of itself  and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market  Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition  Companies like     and the Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   owned  all have a dedicated following of their own  and are all beginning to eat into the market share 
Despite rival companies and regulatory issues  Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs  With billions of dollars in investments already  a thriving rebranding  and its rising popularity among travelers  Airbnb s IPO is one to watch out for

11068,232583,WYND,What Should You Expect From Wyndham  WYN  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Wyndham Worldwide Corporation   NYSE WYN   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 23  before market opens We expect the company s diversified product portfolio  prudent acquisitions and robust marketing efforts to continue driving the bottom line in the quarter In fact  in December 2016  the company s Hotel Group acquired Latin America s leading Fen Hotels while the company s Vacation Rentals entered into a strategic partnership with Unique Ventures  Veeve   Both these deals are expected to boost sales considerably as they add to the company s international presence Meanwhile  increasing business and leisure travel on the back of an improving domestic economy and positive employment numbers are anticipated to boost the quarter s results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to be reported quarter is pegged at  2 01  reflecting an increase of 6 1  over the prior year quarter  Also  the quarter s revenues are expected to grow 6  year over year to  1 67 billion Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segment ContributionWyndham s robust vacation ownership or timeshare business is one of the fastest evolving and profitable sectors in the hospitality industry  Banking on its new sales centers  strong affiliation agreements and improved sales and marketing operations  the company expects to generate substantial sales in its vacation ownership business Thus  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues in this segment is currently pegged at  791 million  reflecting an increase of more than 6  year over year Notably  the company is focused on increasing the number of new owners in vacation ownership segment  Although crucial to the long term health of the business  this move is expected to weigh on the company s near term EBITDA  Hence  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EBITDA in this segment is currently pegged at  192 million  reflecting a modest rise of less than 2  year over year Meanwhile  Wyndham s Destination Network business continues to witness strong growth from its Vacation Rental brands with healthy increases in organic unit count  occupancy and price  Performance is expected to continue to be strong in Europe  where the company has been investing heavily in recruiting  services and improving guest experience to drive growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues in this segment is currently pegged at  515 million  reflecting a rise of 6  year over year Further  given the solid expansion efforts and improving economic indicators leading to robust demand  Wyndham Hotel Group is expected to post strong revenue growth in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenues in this segment is currently pegged at  380 million  reflecting an improvement of 4  year over year Other FactorsAlso contributing to the solid revenue growth expectations are Wyndham s string of initiatives to boost occupancy as well as its strong loyalty program However  certain headwinds persist in the form of lingering uncertainty in various economies like Brazil and Africa that might limit revenue growth  soft demand in oil producing regions that could hurt revenue per available room  RevPAR  in the third quarter and consumer concerns related to pandemic virus like Zika that may somewhat temper growth in the Caribbean region Also  given Wyndham s considerable international operations  negative currency translation might continue hampering the company s results as it has been doing over the last few quarters Taking into account the headwinds  our quantitative model predicts that Wyndham does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat Zacks ESP  Wyndham has an Earnings ESP of  0 75   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Wyndham carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks in the same space  which  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Hilton Worldwide Holdings  Inc    NYSE H   has an Earnings ESP of  0 80  and a Zacks Rank

3 Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set

11076,232591,WYND,In China s hotel lobbies  small gaps in  Great Firewall  are closing,news,"By Pei Li and Cate Cadell BEIJING  Reuters    In China  the plush international hotel lobby has been one of the few places to find gaps in the  Great Firewall   a sophisticated system that denies online users access to blocked content such as foreign news portals and social media platforms like Facebook  O FB  and Twitter  N TWTR   Now  though  that small crack in the system may be closing  too  as Beijing tightens control over what it sees as its domestic cyberspace  mimicking real world border controls and subject to the same laws as sovereign states  Regulators have warned firms providing internet networks for hotels to stop offering  or helping to install  virtual private networks  VPNs  into hotel systems   tools that allow users to evade  at least partially   China s internet censors   We received notices recently from relevant  government  departments  so we don t make recommendations anymore   said a marketing manager at Chinese hotel network provider AMTT Digital  who is not named as he is not authorized to talk to the media  He added this was linked to increased government scrutiny over the use of unauthorized VPNs   VPNs create a  tunnel  through the Great Firewall allowing users to access blocked content outside China s borders  Companies in China routinely use VPNs for their businesses  which Beijing has said are not currently under threat  A notice from the Waldorf Astoria in Beijing  circulated online  said the hotel had stopped offering VPN services  A Waldorf official declined to comment  but several staff said the hotel no longer offered VPN services    VPNs  don t accord with Chinese law   one staffer told Reuters   So we don t have this anymore   A leading internet network provider to hotels in China  AMTT Digital says it works with more than 30 global hotel chains including Marriott  O MAR   InterContinental  L IHG   Shangri La  HK 0069   Wyndham  N WYN   Starwood and Hilton  N HLT    Previously  the firm  which is backed by several funds including ones with government ties  would recommend  certified   or government approved  VPNs  the manager said  which would then be incorporated into hotels  internal networks   We would make recommendations of certified VPN providers and then incorporate them into the gateway so it runs smoothly   he said   But it is up to the hotel to decide if they want it   China s Ministry of Information Industry and Technology  MIIT   which oversees regulation of VPNs  did not respond to requests for comment  As it clamps down further on access to outlawed online content  Beijing has recently closed dozens of China based VPNs  overseas providers have seen rolling attacks on their services  the WhatsApp encrypted messaging app was disrupted  and telecoms firms have been enlisted to extend China s domestic internet control  U S  tech giant Apple Inc  O AAPL  pulled dozens of VPN apps from its App Store in China at the weekend  drawing criticism from app providers who said it was bowing to pressure from Beijing s cyber regulators   We re in the middle of the storm right now with the government fiercely cracking down on VPNs   said Lin Wei  a Beijing based network security expert at Qihoo 360 Technology Co   It s really hard for ordinary people to find anywhere they can get on sites like Google    For a graphic on China s  Great Firewall   click   GOOGLE  BUT NO TWITTER The  neutered  hotel VPNs  which staff and analysts said were often installed with tacit approval from authorities  already underline sensitivities of even ceding small amounts of control  President Xi Jinping has overseen a marked sharpening of China s cyberspace controls  including tough new data surveillance and censorship rules  This push is now ramping up ahead of an expected consolidation of power at the Communist Party Congress this autumn  Guests at the InterContinental hotel on the east side of Beijing can search on Alphabet Inc s  O GOOGL  Google search engine or check their email on Gmail   a business need for many travelers  but both otherwise widely blocked in China   But they can t access Facebook  Twitter or YouTube  which are banned by the government   China also routinely blocks sensitive content online such as searches for the 1989 Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ  protests or  more recently  coverage of imprisoned Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo  who died from cancer last month  These topics are searchable  though  in China using a VPN connection  Technical staff at five other hotels in Beijing  including Crowne Plaza  Hilton and Shangri La  said guests could still access some blocked websites  though others were often still off limits  Officials at the hotels declined to comment  Other hotels Reuters spoke to said they did not offer VPN services because it did not accord with government rules   It s a compromise the hotels are making   said Lin  the network security expert  VPNs were not technically illegal  but were in a  grey area  and  for well known reasons  authorities were cracking down on them  Staff and guests at a number of hotels said some kind of VPN service was still on offer  either built into the hotel s wifi network or on demand to guests who needed access  Reuters visited the InterContinental and Crowne Plaza in Beijing  both owned by InterContinental Hotels Group  where Google and Gmail were unblocked  A worker at the Hilton Beijing hotel said the same sites should be accessible  Officials at IHG and Hilton did not respond to requests for comment  Some hotels went further  A technician at the Pangu 7 Star Hotel in Beijing  owned by exiled tycoon Guo Wengui  said resident guests could get full internet access

11093,232608,WYND,U S  hotel chains circle Cuba as visitors surge  restrictions ease,news,"By Mike Stone and Mitra Taj
NEW YORK LIMA  PERU  Reuters    The race for Cuba s beach front is on 
Executives from major U S  hotel chains have stepped up their interest in the Communist island in recent months  holding informal talks with Cuban officials as Washington loosens restrictions on U S  firms operating there 
Executives from Marriott International  Hilton Worldwide and Carlson Hospitality Group  which runs the Radisson chain  are among those who have held talks with Cuban officials in recent months  they told Reuters 
 We re all very interested   said Ted Middleton  Hilton s senior vice president of development in Latin America   When legally we re allowed to do so we all want to be at the start line ready to go  
The United States and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in July after decades of hostility  Washington chipped away further at the half century old trade embargo this month  allowing certain companies to establish subsidiaries or joint ventures in Cuba as well as open offices  stores and warehouses in Cuba 
The United States wants to strike a deal that lets U S  airlines schedule Cuba flights as soon as possible  a State Department official said last week  amid speculation that a U S  ban on its tourists visiting Cuba could be eased 
U S  hoteliers are not currently allowed to invest in Cuba  and the Caribbean island officially remains off limits for U S  tourists unless they meet special criteria such as being Cuban Americans or join special cultural or educational tours 
Foreign companies have to partner with a Cuban entity to do business and U S  hoteliers expect they will have to do likewise if and when U S  restrictions are lifted 
While they wait for the politicians to iron out their differences  U S  hotel bosses are conducting fact finding missions in Havana and holding getting to know you meetings with government officials in Cuba and various European cities 
This week  Middleton  along with executives from Carlson and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    which runs the Ramada chain  are meeting with Cuba s Deputy Tourism Minister Luis Miguel Diaz at an industry conference in the Peruvian capital  Lima 
In the 1950s Cuba was an exotic playground for U S  celebrities such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardener  as well as ordinary tourists  who travel led there en masse on cheap flights and ships from Miami 
A recent relaxation of some of the restrictions on U S  travelers has encouraged over 106 000 Americans to visit Cuba so far this year  more than the 91 254 who arrived in all of 2014  according to data compiled by tourism professor Jos  Lu s Perell  of the University of Havana 
Overall  tourist arrivals are up nearly 18 percent this year after a record 3 million visitors in 2014  making Cuba the second most popular holiday destination in the Caribbean behind the much smaller Dominican Republic 
U S  hoteliers expect the number of U S  visitors to balloon if all travel restrictions are axed 
 If and when the travel ban is lifted  We estimate there will be over 1 5 million U S  travelers on a yearly basis   said Laurent de Kousemaeker  chief development officer for the Caribbean   Latin American region for Marriott 
De Kousemaeker accompanied other Marriott executives  including chief executive Arne Sorensen  to Havana in July to meet with representatives of management companies and government officials 
HOSPITALITY THE BUZZ WORD
Even if sanctions were lifted soon  Cuba traditionally has been slow to approve foreign investment projects  making it unlikely that U S  hotels would be popping up immediately 
Rivals from Canada and Europe have seized the opportunity  operating and investing in Cuban hotels and resorts  alongside Cuban government partners  for years 
Spanish hotel operator Meli  Hotels International SA  is aiming to have 15 000 rooms in Cuba by 2018  It currently has 13 000 rooms via 27 joint ventures 
London   Regional Properties Ltd  a U K  hotel and real estate development firm  agreed a deal this summer for an 18 hole golf course  hotel and condominium project with state tourism enterprise  Palmares SA  which has a 51 percent stake in the project 
But even with government plans to add 4 000 new hotel rooms every year for the next 15  the island is not ready for a significant surge in tourism 
The island s tourism infrastructure went into decline in the decades following the 1959 revolution  Five star hotel rooms  good restaurants and cheap Internet access are all in short supply 
When and if they get a green light from both governments  executives said U S  hotel chains will likely offer branding and management partnerships to Cuban government partners such as Palmares and Tourism Group Gaviota  the largest Cuban government tourism entity 
The ultimate goal would be to secure long term leases on resort developments  which is how Cuban authorities have generally operated with foreign hotels 
But right now  U S  hoteliers can t even refer to tourism when they meet Cuban counterparts  let alone talk about actual deals  Instead the buzz word is  hospitality  
Marriott s de Kousemaeker likes to use an analogy from baseball  a sport loved both in Cuba and in the United States  to describe the situation

11096,232611,WYND,Exclusive  DOJ probes allegations that Tiversa lied to FTC about data breaches,news,"By Joel Schectman WASHINGTON  Reuters    Federal agents are investigating whether cyber security firm Tiversa gave the government falsified information about data breaches at companies that declined to purchase its data protection services  according to three people with direct knowledge of the inquiry  The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Tiversa s Pittsburgh headquarters in early March and seized documents  the people said  The Justice Department s criminal investigation of Tiversa began after Richard Wallace  a former Tiversa employee  alleged in a 2015 Federal Trade Commission hearing that the cybersecurity firm gave the agency doctored evidence purporting to prove corporate data breaches  the people said  Wallace testified that Tiversa falsified information to make it appear that sensitive data was being accessed by users across the country  Tiversa s information led the FTC to examine whether companies failed to protect consumer data  according to testimony from Wallace and people with knowledge of the FTC inquiries  which can lead to civil charges and settlements with the companies  David Schertler  an attorney at Schertler and Onorato LLP who is representing Tiversa  said the company is cooperating with the investigation  Spokespeople for the Justice Department  the FBI and the FTC declined to comment  The blog Databreaches net first raised the possibility of an FBI raid on Tiversa earlier this month  citing a photo of black vehicles outside the company s office that was posted on Twitter   Tiversa  a Pittsburgh based security company  scours filesharing networks  often used to share music  and offers to help companies and government agencies identify when their data has been stolen by hackers or inadvertently leaked  Data provided by Tiversa led the FTC to send letters to more than 80 companies in early 2010  warning them that customer data had been made public on filesharing networks  according to people familiar with the FTC actions   The FTC also opened investigations into nine companies identified by Tiversa  according to a 2015 staff report from the House Committee on Oversight   Government Reform  which did not name the companies  The status of those cases is not clear  The FTC s involvement with Tiversa raises questions about how the agency investigates data breaches  Critics in the legal community have argued that Congress never granted the FTC power to police data security nor equipped the agency for that mission   They have an incredibly broad mandate  and that means enforcement on a shoe string   said Gerald Ferguson  an expert in data protection law at Baker   Hostetler LLP  The FTC began ramping up its actions against organizations accused of slack security practices in 2008  on the grounds that failing to protect consumer data is an  unfair  or  deceptive  trade practice  Unrelated to the Tiversa matter  Twitter  N TWTR   CVS Caremark  N CVS  and Wyndham Hotels   Resorts  N WYN  are among more than 50 companies the FTC has reached settlements with over alleged lax data security  according to the agency   The settlements with the FTC typically do not involve fines but require the companies to take often costly steps to improve data security   Since the FBI raid earlier in March  Tiversa has placed its CEO Robert Boback on leave as the company conducts an internal investigation about the allegations of improper conduct  according to a person briefed on the case who declined to be named because the investigation is ongoing  Robert Ridge  an attorney for Boback  declined to comment  The allegations against Tiversa first surfaced last year during testimony in the FTC s civil data security case against the cancer testing company LabMD  The case represented the first instance when a company fought and beat the FTC in the agency s administrative court over data security allegations  The FTC alleged that poor security practices at LabMD allowed a patient insurance file to get released through the LimeWire peer to peer filesharing network  which was often used for downloading music  Both the FTC and LabMD said  the information that Tiversa gave the agency was used in the investigation of the cancer testing company   But in FTC s administrative court in Washington  D C  last May  Wallace testified that when Tiversa determined that a company s files were available on filesharing software  Tiversa would reach out to the affected company and pitch its remediation service  When companies such as LabMD declined the offer  their names were included on a list that Boback handed over to the FTC  according to court transcripts of Wallace s testimony  For example  when LabMD refused Tiversa s services  Boback  basically said   f   him  make sure he s at the top of the list    according to Wallace s testimony  Wallace said that he was also instructed to falsify evidence that LabMD s patient file was rapidly spreading online and falling into the hands of identity thieves  Wallace testified that Boback told him    We need this at four different IP addresses  and they need to be bad guys    The Justice Department granted Wallace immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony   The FTC has said in court filings that while information from Tiversa caused the agency to begin the probe  its case against LabMD was supported by its own independent investigation   LabMD CEO Michael Daugherty said in an interview with Reuters that he is a victim of a Tiversa extortion scheme  The costs and distraction associated with the case had driven LabMD out of business  Daugherty said  He acknowledges that one of his employees  in violation of company policy  installed a filesharing software on her computer for her personal use  But Daugherty said the issue harmed no patients  No one outside LabMD ever accessed the file  Daugherty said  and evidence of its spread was falsified by Tiversa   What concerns me is the collaboration between the FTC and bad actors   Daughterty said   This case is not just about LabMD  it s about every company contacted by the FTC   That testimony led FTC Chief Administrative Law Judge D  Michael Chappell to dismiss the case against LabMD last November  ruling that the evidence against the medical company was  unreliable  not credible  and outweighed by credible contrary testimony from Mr  Wallace   according to court records  A Tiversa spokeswoman said in November that the company  acted appropriately and legally in every way with respect to LabMD  despite their efforts to besmirch our reputation   
The agency appealed Judge Chappell s ruling and is now re arguing the case against LabMD before the agency s commissioners ",2016-03-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-doj-probes-allegations-that-tiversa-lied-to-ftc-about-data-breaches-390664,390664
11098,232613,WYND,FTC to focus on consumer injury  minimizing paperwork requests to companies,news,"By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Trade Commission will focus on fraud and be judicious in making paperwork requests when it opens an investigation into a company  acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen said in a speech on Thursday  Ohlhausen called fighting fraud the  core of the FTC s consumer protection mission     These cases may not forge new legal ground or prompt huge headlines but such actions defend the consumer harmed by an unscrupulous con artist   she said at an American Bar Association Consumer Protection Conference in Atlanta  according to an advance text of her speech  Taking a cue from President Donald Trump s interest in cutting red tape  Ohlhausen said that she would push to streamline agency information requests   Such requests impose large compliance costs on legitimate companies   she said  During the Obama administration  the FTC was aggressive in going after companies such as Wyndham Hotels  N WYN  that it alleged were sloppy with consumer data and also pursued companies like POM Wonderful that made health claims the agency felt were inadequately substantiated  That said  she said she supported the FTC s decision to go after the infidelity dating website Ashley Madison after a 2015 data breach resulted in a leak of details on 36 million user accounts  She noted that people committed suicide after they were found to have used the site    Although monetary injury has been our primary focus  we have seen substantial injury arise from the exposure of more than just financial information   she said  But she disagreed with other assessments of harm  including the agency s  20 million settlement with ride hailing company Uber last month over allegations it exaggerated earnings claims to attract drivers   It was an order of magnitude higher than our best evidence of consumer harm   she said  But John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog  which has pushed the FTC to be more aggressive  strongly supported the Uber settlement   Disgorgement seems to be the only way to get the attention of these companies   he said  Alden Abbott of the conservative Heritage Foundation called the acting chairman s priorities  good steps forward  She s careful  she s judicious and focused on consumer injury

Total earnings declined 1 7  from the year ago period while revenues improved only 2 9  Nevertheless  leisure stocks from the sector mostly perform well during the spring and summer seasons and thus the sector s performance is expected to depict a better picture as more companies report their financial numbers Among the leisure stocks that have already reported  Pool Corporation   NASDAQ POOL   and International Speedway Corporation   NASDAQ ISCA   have delivered strong results with their bottom line and top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate Let s take a look at what might be in store for the three leisure stocks that are set to report their third quarter 2017 results on Oct 25  Will they manage to put up a decent performance Wyndham Worldwide Corporation   NYSE WYN   pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 2  in the last quarter  In fact  the company s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 2 41  However  our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Wyndham this quarter  This is because  a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and

Earnings ESP of  0 75  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenue in Wyndham s Vacation Ownership segment is currently pegged at  791 million  reflecting an increase of more than 6  year over year However  its new owner strategy is expected to weigh on its near term EBITDA  Currently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EBITDA in this segment is pegged at  192 million  reflecting a modest rise of less than 2  year over year Yet  certain headwinds persist in the form of lingering uncertainty in various economies  soft demand in oil producing regions  concerns related to the Zika virus and negative currency translation Nevertheless  we expect the company s diversified product portfolio  prudent acquisitions and robust marketing efforts to continue driving the bottom line in the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to be reported quarter is pegged at  2 01  reflecting an

segment and mass gaming revenues in the third quarter  given the improved operating environment there However  stringent capital controls by the Chinese government  increased audits of the junket industry and an excess supply in the Macao market is likely to weigh Las Vegas Sands  results In the meantime  the company s focus on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties are likely to result in high occupancy rates  besides driving segmental performance  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Las Vegas Operations  revenues is pegged at  400 million  reflecting an increase of 4 2   on a sequential basis Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Las Vegas total quarterly revenues of  3 12 billion reflects year over year growth of 5 1   Conversely  the same for current quarter earnings

Adjusted EBITDA increased 6  to  150 million  reflecting increased vacation rental volumes and favorable foreign currency movements  partially offset by the adverse impact of the hurricanes 
Revenues at Vacation Ownership increased 4  year over year to  773 million  The uptick reflects an increase in gross VOI sales as well as higher consumer financing revenues  even though hurricanes in the third quarter negatively impacted VOI sales 
Gross VOI sales in the third quarter increased 7  year over year  Meanwhile  tour flow was up 7  but volume per guest  VPG  was down 1   primarily reflecting a 16  increase in sales to new owners in North America  which produces a lower VPG 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3  to  190 million as higher gross VOI sales and consumer financing revenues were offset by a higher provision for loan losses and increased variable compensation expenses

11106,232621,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry Outlook   November 2017,opinion,"So far  2017 has been welcoming for the U S  hotel industry with moderate demand growth supporting increases in both occupancy and average daily rate  ADR   Resultantly  revenue per available room  RevPAR  witnessed a rise of 3 4  and 2 7   respectively  in the first two quarters 
This is further reflected in the industry s stock price performance  Over the past year  the  has fared better than the broader S P 500 index  While the industry has gained 36 1   the broader index has added only 21  
Though first quarter GDP growth remained moderate at 1 2   the economy picked up pace in the second quarter  expanding at an annual rate of 3 1   better than initially estimated  We note that rising employment  higher real income  and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment  This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel  and higher transaction volumes  which are likely to continue 
Going forward  consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat  suggesting that the U S  economy will remain on solid footing for the balance of 2017  In fact  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model forecasts gross domestic product  GDP  to grow a healthy 2 7   annualized rate  in third quarter 2017 
However  peaking supply growth continues to be a meaningful downside risk and is expected to put pressure on pricing power  thereby tempering the performance somewhat 
What Do the Numbers Say 
Statistics underscore the expectation of moderating but positiveperformance by the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  shows that new supply is likely to rise 1 9  in 2017  slightly below the anticipated demand growth of 2 1   This is likely to result in a 0 2  rise in occupancy rates in 2017 to 65 6  Though ADRand RevPAR are projected to climb 2 1  and 2 3   respectively  in 2017  the rate of increase will be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years 
Meanwhile  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  rose 5 3  in September 2017  In fact  year to date  the index is up 16 6   Higher interest rates  enhanced prospects for potential tax reform  and anticipated hurricane related demand tailwinds aided the outperformance 
Additionally  according to Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  U S  hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics  While overall occupancy at U S  hotels was up 2 4  year over year for the week ended Oct 14  2017  ADR rose 5 3   Resultantly  RevPAR grew 7 8  in the same time frame 
Obstacles Facing Hoteliers
Uncertainty  both international and domestic  may continue to weigh on the performance of the U S  lodging industry 
On the one hand  negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States given the Trump administration s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis bad for hotels  On the other hand  if the U S  dollar gains strength  this may keep the industry s growth at check  given its impact on inbound  international travel 
Additionally  higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose as headwinds 
Meanwhile  hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do so  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Moreover  high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers  and as they won t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like  their profits may be dented further  In fact  online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN  are also limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   Notably  both the companies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
What Can Drive Growth 
The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions  So the present solid economic fundamentals that is likely to continue to spur consumer spending in the remaining of 2017  raises optimism for hoteliers  Moreover  hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better  if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services 
Meanwhile  keeping aside the necessary hotel renovation and reconstruction which could be costly and time consuming  other post hurricane dynamics could work to the advantage of the lodging industry 
Also  hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory  In fact  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  was being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 
So far in 2017  the hotel industry has proved to be resilient during this marketplace shift  Going forward  the industry is estimated to witness continued success 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among millennials   will remain the priorities  Acute  focused investment in infrastructure to attract more business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth 
Why Hotel Stocks Still Have Some Upside Left
As the industry has underperformed the broader market over the last five years  it seems there is a value oriented path ahead  Looking at the industry s EV EBITDA ratio  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization   which is the best multiple for valuing hotels as they are highly capital intensive  investors might still want to pay more 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 11 7  which compares favorably with what it saw in the last five years  The ratio is lower than the average of 12 7x and the high of 17 8x over the last five years 
Moreover  it compares somewhat favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is 11 6x 
Overall  the valuation of the industry from an EV EBITDA perspective looks attractive when compared with its own range in the same time period  Moreover  its somewhat lower than market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead

Conclusion
Looking at the recent economic indicators and the industry s cheap valuation  growth prospects of the U S  hotel industry appear bright 
Though industry wide headwinds continue to weigh on investor sentiment  hotel companies have good reasons to remain optimistic  Particularly  those willing to venture out of their comfort zones and be responsive to changing consumer expectations to provide a more holistic offering  are sure to emerge winners 
Overall  despite the ongoing economic and political uncertainty  economic fundamentals appear strong enough to support more modest growth in the short to medium term without any additional stimulus

11107,232622,WYND,U S  Hotels Bank On Expansion  Unique Offerings For Growth,opinion,"Despite the surge of new inventory in the marketplace along with economic and political upheaval in certain pockets all over the world  confident consumers are likely to bode well for hotels Also  as people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones over the upcoming holiday season and keep looking for unique experiences at all price points  hoteliers believe that their diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand Thus  we see no reason why the U S  hotel industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom lines in the near term  albeit at a more modest pace than the past two or three years In fact  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over both the short and the long terms  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to Demand Supply Gap Favorable  Improving economic indicators are blessings for the hotel industry as these have perked up leisure and business travel demand  Though group occupancy has been mostly down of late  higher transient occupancy indicate that demand is being lifted by individual travelers  both domestic and international Notably  the supply demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010 with growth in demand outpacing supply growth  Though  of late  the gap between demand and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has slowed  higher average daily rates  ADRs  are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  
Meanwhile  the recent hurricanes have had a mixed impact on U S  hotels  Though major hotel markets that were affected saw dramatic performance declines  evacuation destinations experienced significant performance growth Surely  renovation and rebuilding work will take time and prove costly  Yet this could bring good news for the U S  hotel industry  given the expected moderation of demand going forward  This is because the number of rooms under construction could fall considerably in the near term  resulting in a slower rise in supply 
In fact  hotels that are able to re open shortly could see higher demand in the coming months as residents dislocated by the storm or flooding look for a place to stay in the interim and from increased influx of hurricane related visitors  Notably  even if room demand remains steady  occupancy rates can be expected to rise as supply declines  Though ADRs are likely to remain largely unaffected  the slightly stronger occupancy projections may push RevPar higher 
Thus  taking into account the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year and impact of hurricanes  we expect the gap to remain favorable in 2017 as well  Notably  PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  is projecting demand  2 1  rise  to outpace supply  increase of 2   once again in 2017  This will lead to the eighth successive year of occupancy growth for the U S  lodging industry 
Differentiated Offerings to Boost Growth  Hotel chains are meticulously working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to gain competitive advantage  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the mass market as well as luxury space  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially the luxury segment  hotels will have to differentiate themselves Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus their ability to innovate will hold the key to success  Therefore  ace hoteliers like Marriott  Belmond Ltd   BEL  and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to sync their brands to the order of the day Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism market and their tastes and expectations are widely different from their preceding generations  
According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation  Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from the parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Marriott s Element  Aloft and Edition  Andaz by Hyatt  and InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in emerging markets with great long term potential despite looming macroeconomic concerns A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises significant growth  despite an economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially ahead  Notably  China is the largest source market for outbound travel now  In fact  Chinese outbound travel is set to boom further with 700 million trips projected over the next five years   Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott International  Inc   MAR   In fact  Marriott recently entered into a joint venture with Alibaba  NYSE BABA   the largest e commerce platform in the world  With this partnership  the company aims to capture a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market  expand membership of its loyalty programs and reduce distribution costs Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market Notably  Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  is also continuously looking to expand its brand presence and enter under penetrated markets such as India and China  Among others  Japan  Indonesia  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers  The key players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure Many of the hoteliers are also looking to leverage from Latin America s upsurge in accommodation demand  In this respect  Wyndham Worldwide Corporation s  WYN  Hotel Group announced the acquisition of Latin America s leading Fen Hotels in Dec 2016  Meanwhile  with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75  by 2018 Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   Choice Hotels International Inc   CHH  and Wyndham have a strong foothold in this region Expansion in these lucrative markets would help the companies gain market share in the hospitality industry  thereby boosting their business  Also  with global travel estimated to increase at a 7  compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips expected to top 1 8 billion by 2030  such rapid expansion plans by hoteliers  bode well Loyalty Programs  In order to survive in a tough economic environment  hoteliers are continuously devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  Of these  offering loyalty programs is one of the best  Given the fact that rewards  members stay longer than nonmembers and generate more revenues for their franchisees  hoteliers have been increasingly focusing on their loyalty programs Notably  with about 52 million members  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry  In fact  as per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company  Wyndham Rewards is touted to be the most rewarding loyalty program in the U S  hotel industry with an average return of 16 7  in value on every dollar spent on a room booking  Notably  the company expects Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit its new owner growth target of 23  Meanwhile  following its acquisition of Starwood  Marriott has linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community  Loyalty programs are Marriott s most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations designed to provide a more rewarding experience to guests Meanwhile  in first quarter 2017  Hyatt launched a new loyalty program  World of Hyatt  which replaced its Gold Passport loyalty program  Notably  World of Hyatt is a platform for guest engagement  Given these enhancements  the company expects the program to build even higher levels of guest preference and help in sustaining market share gains It is to be noted that Hilton has created one of the largest loyalty programs  Hilton Honors  With more than 63 million members  this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company  In fact  about 57  of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program  Choice Hotels  loyalty program  Choice Privileges  is rapidly expanding and continues to drive guests to its franchisees  hotels  The program recently surpassed 32 million members and has already added more than 2 5 million new members so far this year Loyalty programs are thus the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience Embracing Social Media and Smartphone Technology to Build Loyalty  In today s world of price comparison and shared economy  hotels have to constantly push their boundaries to retain customers  In this regard  digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role  Social media can enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests  especially millennials and can  in turn  increase loyalty and market share  
Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers to select hotels  Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and offering interactive maps GPS to increase occupancy and offer a faster and seamless experience In fact  mobile check ins and check outs have increased substantially over the past few years and so has the enthusiasm for chat based messaging apps  like chatbots  among potential hotel customers  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry  Thus  the majority of hoteliers are investing in mobile check in  fast Wi Fi  and digital room keys to enhance guest experience However  with basic functionalities such as hotel check ins  and shopping and booking capability becoming the norm  hoteliers will have to leverage the power of mobile phones to take on property experience to the next level  A confluence of technologies  including faster processing power  cloud computing  and Internet of Things  IoT   is set to bundle up to enhance the mobile channel  Hotels should seriously consider the implications of falling behind during this wave of mobile transformation Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences   and deliver a differentiated experience   which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more Key PicksTop ranked stocks in the industry include Marriott  Choice Hotels  Hilton and Extended Stay America  Inc   STAY   All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks hereDespite being Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  we are optimistic about Hyatt and China Lodging Group  Ltd   HTHT   given their positive outlook for the rest of 2017 Bottom LineThe lodging sector will prove to be a worthy investment proposition in the near to medium term provided the economy continues to grow  This in turn will keep investor confidence high and lead to greater demand  thereby boosting hoteliers  profitability Particularly  hoteliers with experience  strong equity  compelling brands and unique ideas in great markets  and those that are solid borrowers and considered trustworthy will be able to expand and surely convert some of the challenges into opportunities  going forward Also  hoteliers will have to be smart enough to capitalize on the shifting trends and adapt as per changing consumer expectations  Instead of offering intricate programs and schemes to gain customer loyalty  hotel companies must now focus on a re imagined technology strategy  and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences  Loyalty will follow automatically Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs from an earnings and valuation perspective as well as the trend for this important sector ",2017-11-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-hotels-bank-on-expansion-unique-offerings-for-growth-200257719,200257719

11109,232624,WYND,Hotel Stocks Challenged By Trump Slump  Economic Woes,opinion,"The moderating but positive outlook on lodging demand growth raises hope  Then again  the so called  Trump Slump  in travel    the anticipated decline in foreign travelers to the United States due to Trump administration policies regarding immigration    is a threat to the U S  economy or the hotel industry 
Additionally  increased supply coupled with macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could keep hoteliers  growth in check  This makes it important to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry 
Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near and the long term 
Trump s Policies Hover Over Hoteliers  President Trump s efforts to impose a travel ban on inbound travelers from some predominantly Muslim countries along with the ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U S  bound aircraft from certain countries has affected travel demand to and from the United States 
Though the bans have been temporary  his stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas to deter foreigners from entering the United States appear to have made international visitors rethink their vacation in the country  thereby castinga pall on future travel demand  The President has also talked about building a wall along the U S  southern border to curb Mexican immigrants entering the country illegally 
Notably  since Trump took office  though there have been clear signs and data suggesting that though more people are traveling than ever before the number of people willing to travel to the United Stateshas reduced dramatically thanks to his plans  In fact  there s been continued slowdown in U S  bound air travel bookings ever since  Also  online searches by prospective travelers to the United States have also been witnessing a sharp decline 
America is thus bucking the trend and not in a good way  Per new insights from the U S  Travel Association  visitor numbers contracted in four out of the seven months for which data is available this year  materializing fears that Trump s policies are putting tourists off visiting the United States  Notably  the declines were the steepest in February and March  immediately after the so called  Muslim ban  came into force 
In fact  as per Tourism Economics  earlier estimations  the drop off in tourism is anticipated to result in 4 3 million fewer visitors this year  This adds up to a staggering loss of  7 4 billion in revenues for the United States  Meanwhile  another 6 3 million visitors and the  10 8 billion that they would have spent is likely to be lost in 2018 due to these policies 
Thus  as tourists plan to steer clear of Trump s America  this is sure to be detrimental to the hotel businesses and the overall Leisure   Hospitality industry 
Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets  Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social political impact of   Brexit   and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia  Though Trump s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia  instead of the United States  various concerns in these regions raise eyebrows 
Notably  a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales  In fact  a weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil led to softer tourism numbers in 2015 and 2016  This has continued so far in 2017 and is not expected to change much for the rest of the year  Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to restrict hoteliers  revenues 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Terror attacks in key European cities like London  Paris  Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism  Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind  Additionally  concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
If these aren t enough  a cooling economy in China   which might continue to hurt discretionary spending and travel   and concerns over Japan owing to a weaker yen and tax increases are adding to hoteliers  woes 
Meanwhile  in the Middle East  political unrest  lower government spending  new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends  Any respite from these ills in the region is not expected in the near term 
Most of the leading hoteliers  have considerable presence in the above mentioned markets and are thus vulnerable to the economic conditions in these regions as it might limit their business growth 
Fluctuation in Exchange Rates  Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott International  Inc   MAR   Hyatt Hotels Corp   H   Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the country and are therefore highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates  Thus  continued volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt their results as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 
Meanwhile  if the U S  dollar strengthens against various other currencies  negative currency translation is going to be a major concern for these companies  Also  a strong dollar means that travel to the United Statesis becoming more expensive for visitors from other countries and they might look for alternative destinations  This  in turn  will likely thwart travel demand and length of stays  Both these factors would possibly be detrimental to the hotel industry 
Slowing RevPar Trends   Operating Margins Under Pressure  Most of the hoteliers in the United States have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room  RevPAR  trends of late because of continued muted international visitation  Moreover  continued increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents  thereby hurting RevPAR 
Moreover  the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions  mainly parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia  to continue taking a toll on RevPAR 
Operating margins for hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the United States given the spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep pace with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This will  however  come at the cost of near term margins 
Meanwhile  as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop  hotel managers are expected to continue struggling to control their largest operating expense   labor costs  Rising salaries  wages and benefits  as well as increased staffing levels have been adding to hoteliers  labor costs 
Moreover  hoteliers are unable to match the rising cost of operations with the increase in room rates  This is lowering their ability to achieve levels of profit growth observed in the last four to five years 
Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and The Priceline Group s  PCLN  Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which contracts their margins  Higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less strict regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are competing head to head with traditional players in certain segments of the market  and even seizing share from them 
Stocks to Avoid

it looks for new development opportunities and tactical brand acquisitions globally To this end  the company completed the buyout of Fen Hotels  significantly expanding its presence in Latin America

11123,232638,WYND,Will Loyalty Programs Welcome Greater Growth In U S  Hotels ,opinion,The U S  hotel industry is set to see continued growth albeit at a decelerating pace for the rest of the year  This is premised on a rise in business and leisure travel along with higher transaction volumes on the back of an improving economy  rising employment  higher real income  and increased household net worth Even then  peaking supply growth is expected to put pressure on pricing power  thereby tempering the performance somewhat  Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   that have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants Thus  in order to survive in a tough economic environment  hoteliers are continuously devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  Of these  offering loyalty programs is one of the best ways It is to be noted that rewards  members stay longer than nonmembers and generate more revenues for their franchisees  Also  apart from bracing against the popularity of Airbnb  hotel operators are emphasizing loyalty programs to persuade travelers to book rooms directly through their channels and limit the flow of commission dollars to online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    TripAdvisor and The Priceline Group Inc In fact  loyalty programs have started to play an essential part in determining customer preference for hotels and influence their stay frequency and spending   more than ever before  Consequently  despite the added costs associated with these programs  hoteliers are increasingly focusing on these Top PlayersAs loyalty becomes a priority for the industry  hotels are doing away with traditional ideas and trying new strategies to lure both short and long term business Evidently  all the top players in the hotel space continue to make multiple enhancements to their loyalty programs to make them customer centric  They do so to add value for guests and the overall system Notably  Wyndham Worldwide Corporation s   NYSE WYN   Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry  Recently  Wyndham became the first hospitality company to globally expand its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties With over 52 million members  the company expects Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit its new owner growth target of 23   Further  the company has formed an alliance with Caesars Entertainment Corporation   NASDAQ CZR    which will unite two of the world s leading hotel and casino loyalty programs Markedly  post its acquisition of Starwood  Marriott International Inc    NASDAQ MAR   has linked industry leading guest loyalty programs  namely Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest  It also announced the matching of member status between the programs  thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community  Loyalty programs are Marriott s most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations designed to provide a more rewarding experience to its guests It is to be noted that Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE H   has created one of the largest loyalty programs  Hilton Honors  With more than 63 million members  this network has created an extremely valuable asset for the company  In fact  about 57  of all occupancy per night takes place through this member program In fact  the company recently entered into a partnership with American Express  NYSE AXP   Amex  in a bid to boost the program s ability to drive demand  Slated to begin in January 2018  Amex will launch and market a portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the country  which will aid in growing the program s membership and deepen member engagement Meanwhile  in first quarter 2017  Hyatt Hotels Corporation   NYSE H   launched a new loyalty program  World of Hyatt  which replaced its Gold Passport loyalty program  Notably  World of Hyatt is a platform for guest engagement  Given these enhancements  the company expects the program to build even higher levels of guest preference and help in sustaining market share gains Choice Hotels International  Inc  s   NYSE H   loyalty program  Choice Privileges  is rapidly expanding and continues to drive guest to its franchisees  hotels  The program recently surpassed 32 million members and has already added more than 2 5 million new members this year In fact  as per a recent study conducted by Ideaworks Company last week  Wyndham Rewards is touted to be the most rewarding loyalty program in the U S  hotel industry with an average return of 16 7  in value on every dollar spent on a room booking  followed by Marriott Rewards and Hilton Honors While Hilton has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Wyndham  Marriott  Hyatt and Choice Hotels currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Bottom LineOver the past six months  the  has fared better than the broader S P 500 index  While the industry has gained 22 1   the broader index has added only 8 4  Going forward  hoteliers need to be smart enough to capitalize on the shifting trends and adapt to new consumer expectations Given that loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience  hoteliers must continuously reengineer these to provide a more fulfilling experience  Loyalty will follow automatically Also  as loyalty programs offer greater flexibility and personalization  these may incentivize repeat bookings and lead to long term revenue growth Thus  loyalty programs are likely to play a key role in moving the industry even higher than its current position at the top 31  among the 265 Zacks industries Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and

11134,232649,WYND,Marriott Rides On Expansion   Initiatives  Revenue Woes Stay,opinion,"On Sep 8  we issued an updated research report on Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   
Though the company has solid long term growth potential but the risks from near term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum Acquisitions to Boost Growth
Marriott continues to rely on acquisitions in order to expand its footprint  After announcing the acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts on Sep 23  2016  Marriott has become the world s largest hotel company  spanning across 125 countries with more than 6 200 properties 
Post acquisition  shares of the company have rallied 48 7  since the date while the broader S P 500 index has gained 13 4  in the same time frame 

Moreover  Marriott s distribution has more than doubled in Asia and the Middle East   Africa combined with the purchase of Starwood  Also  the company believes that the deal will be accretive to cash flow and earnings by the second year following closure and result in annual cost savings of at least  250 million on the back of lower operating  and general   administrative expenses 
Also  Marriott became the largest hotel company in Africa with the Protea Hospitality Group buyout in 2014  This was followed by the acquisition of Delta Hotels and Resorts brand in 2015 
Interestingly  even with 30 brands under portfolio  the company has not ruled out further mergers and acquisitions activities  Holding about 14  15  market share in the United States alone  Marriott is well positioned to capitalize on the existing growth potential 
Solid Expansion Plans
Marriott s extensive portfolio and a strong brand position allow it to charge a premium room rate in the highly competitive lodging industry  Given its property locations  we believe that the company is well poised to benefit from the increasing market demand backed by stepped up business as well as leisure traveling 
Notably  in addition to domestic markets  Marriott is consistently trying to expand its presence worldwide and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets  Going forward  the company plans to significantly grow its global portfolio of luxury and lifestyle brands  In fact  it anticipates net room additions of 6  in 2017 
Outside the United States  the hotel company is trying to expand its footprint  especially in Asia  Latin America  Middle East and Africa  Meanwhile  Marriott s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and is expected to continue  going forward 
Further  it is to be noted that China is the largest source market for outbound travel now  with 700 million trips projected over the next five years  Thus  the company aims to broaden its offerings of guest amenities and services appealing to Chinese travelers in more hotels  In this regard  Marriott expects its new joint venture with Alibaba  NYSE BABA  to aid in capturing a greater share of this growing Chinese travel market  thereby growing membership of its loyalty programs and reducing distribution costs 
All in all  we expect the company s continuous expansion plans to add immensely to the top line and boost its overall performance as well 
Other Prospects
Digital innovations and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in hotel bookings  Marriott too has rolled out guestVoice to measure guest feedback  introduced SPG Mobile check in and check out in North America  and achieved procurement and OTA cost savings 
Additionally  post its Starwood acquisition  the company has linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  thus leading to an even larger loyalty community 
These investments in technology for hotel bookings are likely to improve guest experience and thus boost occupancy in the long run 
Most importantly  frequent share buybacks and continuous increase in quarterly dividend payments affirm the company s optimistic outlook and growth prospects 
Potential Headwinds to the Top Line
Despite immense growth potential  a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region  In the Middle East  political unrest and low oil prices also continue to hurt tourism 
Meanwhile  in the domestic market  the company is facing increased competition in New York due to oversupply of hotels  Furthermore  soft demand in the oil producing regions is expected to continue hurting RevPAR  Revenue per Available Room  
Also in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to remain challenging post Brexit  Given Marriott s considerable presence therein  this might limit its business growth  Additionally  soft economic conditions in France and terror threats in some major locations are expected to hurt revenues of the company 
Marriott s considerable international presence also makes it highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates  In addition  significant currency headwinds are affecting most hotel companies across the world  including Hyatt Hotels Corp    NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide Holdings   NYSE H    Wyndham Worldwide Corp    NYSE WYN    etc  This volatility is expected to prevail in the near term 
Currently  Marriott carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these

equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the

for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Wyndham Worldwide has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Wyndham Worldwide s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Wyndham Worldwide has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Wyndham Worldwide stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Wyndham Worldwide has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Wyndham Worldwide currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Wyndham Worldwide a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8  which is far better than the industry average of 15 7  Clearly  WYN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Wyndham Worldwide might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives WYN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Wyndham Worldwide Corp Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineWyndham Worldwide is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover a strong industry rank  Top 13   further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past one year  the  has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars But here s something even more remarkable  You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar  And then you can apply it to your portfolio in as little as 10 minutes a month ,2017-09-03,Zacks Investment

11165,232680,WYND,2017 Set To Bring Modest Growth For U S  Hotel Industry,opinion,"Despite economic and political uncertainty in parts of the world  overall demand for travel and hospitality services continues to rise  Consumers are looking for unique experiences at all price points and hoteliers believe that their diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand  The improving outlook for the U S  and global economies is helping push the business travel segment as well 
Confident consumers bode well for hotels despite the surge of new inventory in the marketplace  Thus  we see no reason why the U S  hotel industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom lines  in the near term  albeit at a more modest pace compared with the past two or three years 
As such  we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over both the short and the long terms  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to 
Demand Supply Gap Favorable  Improving economic indicators is a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and business travel demand  The supply demand environment in the U S  has been favorable since 2010  with growth in demand outpacing supply growth  Though  of late  the gap between demand growth and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has slowed  higher average daily rates  ADRs  are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  
We realize that favorable prior year comparisons contributed to strong demand growth in first quarter 2017  and that pace cannot be sustained through the rest of 2017  with demand expected to moderate  Nevertheless  in spite of the large pipeline of hotels  both CBRE Hotels  Americas Research and PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  are projecting demand  2 1  rise  to outpace supply  increase of 2   once again in 2017  given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year  thereby resulting in the eighth successive year of occupancy growth for the U S  lodging industry 
International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in emerging markets with great long term potential despite looming macroeconomic concerns 
A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises significant growth  despite an economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially ahead  In fact  China is the fastest growing lodging market in the world  Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott International  Inc   MAR  
Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Notably  Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  is also continuously looking to expand its brand presence and enter under penetrated markets such as India and China  Among others  Japan  Indonesia  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers 
The key players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure 
Many of the hoteliers are also looking to leverage from Latin America s upsurge in accommodation demand  In this regard  Wyndham Worldwide Corporation s  WYN  Hotel Group announced the acquisition of Latin America s leading Fen Hotels in Dec 2016  Meanwhile  with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75  by 2018 
Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   Choice Hotels International Inc   CHH  and Wyndhamhave a strong foothold in this region 
In fact  Marriott has increased its full year 2017 RevPAR expectations following stronger than expected RevPAR performance in North America in the first quarter and improving demand trends in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions 
Expansion in these lucrative markets would help the companies gain market share in the hospitality industry  thereby boosting their business  Also  with global travel estimated to increase at a 7  compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips expected to top 1 8 billion by 2030  such rapid expansion plans by hoteliers  bodes well 
Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel chains are meticulously working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to gain competitive advantage  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the mass market as well as luxury space  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially the luxury segment  hotels will have to differentiate themselves 
Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus their ability to innovate will hold the key to success  Therefore  ace hoteliers like Marriott  Belmond Ltd   BEL  and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to sync their brands to the order of the day 
Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism market and their tastes and expectations are widely different from their preceding generations 
According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation  Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from the parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Marriott s Element  Aloft and Edition  Andaz by Hyatt  and InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo 
Loyalty Programs  In order to survive in a tough economic environment  hoteliers are continuously devising ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  Of these  offering loyalty programs is one of the best ways  Given the fact that rewards  members stay longer than nonmembers and generate more revenues for their franchisees  hoteliers have been increasingly focusing on their loyalty programs 
Notably  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry  Recently  Wyndham became the first hospitality company to globally expand its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties  In Mar 2017  the Wyndham Rewards program surpassed 50 million member enrollments  a major achievement  In fact  the company expects Wyndham Rewards to generate nearly a third of the incremental tours needed to hit its new owner growth target of 23  
Meanwhile  following its acquisition of Starwood  Marriott has linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  thereby leading to an even larger loyalty community  Loyalty programs are Marriott s most powerful marketing platform and it continues to invest in marketing partnerships and innovations designed to provide a more rewarding experience to guests 
Meanwhile  in first quarter 2017  Hyatt launched a new loyalty program  World of Hyatt  which replaced its Gold Passport loyalty program  Notably  World of Hyatt is a platform for guest engagement  Given these enhancements  the company expects the program to build even higher levels of guest preference and help in sustaining market share gains 
Loyalty programs are thus the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience 
Embracing Social Media and Smartphone Technology to Build Loyalty  In today s world of price comparison and shared economy  hotels have to constantly push their boundaries to retain customers  In this regard  digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role  Social media can enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests  especially millennials and can  in turn  increase loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers to select hotels  Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and offering interactive maps GPS to increase occupancy and offer a faster and seamless experience 
In fact  mobile check ins and check outs have increased substantially over the past few years and so has the enthusiasm for chat based messaging apps  like chatbots  among potential hotel customers  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry  Thus  the majority of hoteliers are investing in mobile check in  fast Wi Fi  and digital room keys to enhance guest experience 
However  with basic functionalities such as hotel check ins  and shopping and booking capability becoming the norm  hoteliers will have to leverage the power of mobile phones to take on property experience to the next level  A confluence of technologies  including faster processing power  cloud computing and Internet of Things  IoT   is set to bundle up to enhance the mobile channel  Hotels should seriously consider the implications of falling behind during this wave of mobile transformation 
Many hoteliers are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences   and deliver a differentiated experience   which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more 
Key Picks
Top ranked stocks in the industry include Choice Hotels  Hilton and Extended Stay America  Inc   STAY   While Choice Hotels sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Hilton and Extended Stay carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Despite being Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  we are optimistic about Hyatt  Wyndham and China Lodging Group  Limited  HTHT   given their positive outlook for 2017 
Bottom Line
The lodging sector will prove to be a worthy investment proposition in the near to medium term provided the economy continues to shows signs of recovery  This in turn will keep investor confidence high and lead to greater demand  thereby boosting hoteliers  profitability 
Particularly  hoteliers with experience  solid equity  strong brands and unique ideas in great markets  and those that are solid borrowers and considered trustworthy will be able to expand and surely convert some of the challenges into opportunities in 2017 
Also  hoteliers will have to be smart enough to capitalize on the shifting trends and adapt as per changing consumer expectations in 2017  Instead of offering intricate programs and schemes to gain customer loyalty  hotel companies must now focus on re imagined technology strategy  and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences  Loyalty will follow automatically

11166,232681,WYND,Hotel Stocks Challenged By  Trump Slump   Increased Supply,opinion,"It is reasonable to take a favorable view of the lodging industry s supply demand fundamentals given the improving U S  and global economic outlook  Then again  the so called  Trump Slump  in travel    the anticipated decline in foreign travelers to the U S  due to Trump administration s policies    does not bode well for the U S  economy or the hotel industry 
Additionally  increased supply coupled with macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies   could keep hoteliers  growth under check  This makes it important to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry 
Below we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near and the long term 
Trump s Policies Hover Over Hoteliers  President Donald Trump s efforts to impose a travel ban barring inbound travelers from some predominantly Muslim countries along with the recent ban on a broad range of electronic devices in the cabins of U S  bound aircraft from certain countries and talks of expanding the same have cast a pall on future travel demand to and from the U S  The President has also talked about building a wall along the U S  southern border to curb Mexican immigrants entering the country illegally 
Trump s travel ban orders have been stymied by federal judges  However  his stringent policies on immigration and tourist visas to deter foreigners from the U S  appear to have made international visitors rethink their vacation in the U S 
Notably  since Trump took office  there have been clear signs and data suggesting that the number of people willing to travel to the U S  has already reduced dramatically  thanks to his plans  In fact  there s been a continued slow down in U S  bound air travel bookings ever since  Also  online searches by prospective travelers to the U S  have also been witnessing a sharp decline 
In fact  as per Tourism Economics  the drop off in tourism is anticipated to result in 4 3 million lesser visitors this year  This adds up to a staggering loss of  7 4 billion in revenues for the U S  Meanwhile  another 6 3 million visitors and  10 8 billion that they would have spent is estimated to be lost in 2018  due to Trump rhetoric and policies 
Thus  as tourists plan to steer clear of Donald Trump s America  the U S  travel industry is bearing the brunt of his unpopular policies  As the U S  has become by some degree  a less desirable place to visit  causing billions in lost revenue it is sure to be detrimental to hoteliers  businesses and the overall industry 
Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets  Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues like the social political impact of   Brexit   and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia  Though Trump s stringent policies might make travelers opt for Europe and Asia  instead of the U S   various concerns in these regions raise eyebrows 
Notably  a sluggish economy and oversupply in Brazil are weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales  In fact  a weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil led to softer tourism numbers in 2015 and 2016  This is likely to continue in 2017  Continued uncertainty in Africa and macroeconomic factors in Venezuela are likely to restrict hoteliers  revenues 
Meanwhile  hoteliers like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  expect pandemic virus like Zika to continue tempering growth in the Caribbean region 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Recent terror assaults in key European cities like London  Paris  Zurich and Brussels have also affected tourism  Challenging market dynamics in France is a potent headwind  Additionally  concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
If these aren t enough  the slowing down of the Chinese economy   which might continue to hurt discretionary spending and travel   and concerns over Japan owing to a weaker yen and tax increases are adding to hoteliers  woes 
Meanwhile  in the Middle East  political unrest  lower government spending  new hotel supply and a tough oil market continue to hurt tourism and RevPAR trends  Any respite from these ills in the region is not expected in the near term 
Most of the leading hoteliers  have considerable presence in the above mentioned markets and are thus vulnerable to the economic conditions in these regions as it might limit their business growth 
Slowing RevPar Trends  Most of the hoteliers in the U S  have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room  RevPAR  trends of late because of continued muted international visitation  Moreover  continued increase in supply of hotels in the domestic market is limiting room rents  thereby hurting RevPAR 
Moreover  the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions   mainly parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia   to continue taking a toll on RevPAR 
Fluctuation in Exchange Rates  Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott  Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  WYN  generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U S  and are therefore highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates  Thus  continued volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt their results as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 
Meanwhile  as the U S  dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies  negative currency translation is a major concern for these companies  Also  a strong dollar means that travel to the U S  is becoming more expensive for visitors from other countries and they might look for alternative destinations  This is likely to thwart travel demand and length of stays 
Both these factors may possibly be detrimental to the hotel industry  In fact  Marriott and Hyatt has been witnessing fewer international guests at its U S  hotels  given a stronger dollar  Meanwhile  Marriott and Wyndham are also bearing the brunt of the Venezuelan currency devaluation 
Operating Margins Under Pressure  Operating margins for hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U S  given the spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep pace with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This will however come at the cost of near term margins 
Meanwhile  as the economy improves and unemployment levels drop  hotel managers are expected to continue struggling to control their largest operating expense   labor costs  Rising salaries  wages and benefits  as well as increased staffing levels have been adding to hoteliers  labor costs 
Moreover  hoteliers are unable to match the rising cost of operations with the increase in room rates  This is lowering their ability to achieve levels of profit growth observed in the last four to five years 
Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and The Priceline Group s  PCLN  Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which are contracting their margins  Higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less strict regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are competing head to head with traditional players in certain segments of the market and even seizing share from them 
Stocks to Avoid
A couple of players in the space that induce our cautious to bearish outlook are Marriott and Peak Resorts  Inc   SKIS   Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
You can see  
To Conclude
Negative sentiments related to traveling to and from the U S  thanks to Trump along with decline in international inbound travel given a strengthening U S  dollar are acting as the major spoilers for the U S  hotel industry 
Additionally  various geopolitical and economic woes  oversupply  and higher costs are wreaking havoc on the hotel industry  Nevertheless  it remains to be seen whether improving economic indicators and initiatives undertaken by hoteliers can offset these negatives 
Let us see how these companies fare  brave the challenges and register profits in the coming days  In  we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry forward

	Despite economic and political uncertainty in parts of the world  overall demand for travel and hospitality services continues to rise  Consumers are looking for unique experiences at all price points and hoteliers believe that their diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand  The improving outlook for the U S  and global economies is helping push the business travel segment as well 

	Confident consumers bode well for hotels despite the surge of new inventory in the marketplace  Thus  we see no reason why the U S  hotel industry should not continue to enjoy gains on both the top and the bottom lines  in the near term  albeit at a more modest pace compared with the past two or three years 

	As such  we see plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over both the short and the long terms  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to 

Demand Supply Gap Favorable   Improving economic indicators is a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and business travel demand  The supply demand environment in the U S  has been favorable since 2010  with growth in demand outpacing supply growth  Though  of late  the gap between demand growth and supply growth has narrowed considerably and occupancy growth has slowed  higher average daily rates  ADRs  are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  

	We realize that favorable prior year comparisons contributed to strong demand growth in first quarter 2017  and that pace cannot be sustained through the rest of 2017  with demand expected to moderate  Nevertheless  in spite of the large pipeline of hotels  both CBRE Hotels  Americas Research and PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  are projecting demand  2 1  rise  to outpace supply  increase of 2   once again in 2017  given the positive economic outlook for the remainder of the year  thereby resulting in the eighth successive year of occupancy growth for the U S  lodging industry 

International Expansion   Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in emerging markets with great long term potential despite looming macroeconomic concerns 

	A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises significant growth  despite an economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially ahead  In fact  China is the fastest growing lodging market in the world  Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor forMarriott International  Inc   NASDAQ        

	Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Notably Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE        is also continuously looking to expand its brand presence and enter under penetrated markets such as India and China  Among others  Japan  Indonesia  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers 

	The key players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure 

	Many of the hoteliers are also looking to leverage from Latin America s upsurge in accommodation demand  In this regard Wyndham Worldwide Corporation s  NYSE        Hotel Group announced the acquisition of Latin America s leading Fen Hotels in Dec 2016  Meanwhile  with an increasing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico  Colombia and Brazil  Marriott expects its distribution in the Caribbean and Latin American region to increase 75  by 2018 

	Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   NYSE         Choice Hotels International Inc   NYSE        and Wyndham have a strong foothold in this region 

	In fact  Marriott has increased its full year 2017 RevPAR expectations following stronger than expected RevPAR performance in North America in the first quarter and improving demand trends in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions 

	Expansion in these lucrative markets would help the companies gain market share in the hospitality industry  thereby boosting their business  Also  with global travel estimated to increase at a 7  compounded rate over the next 10 years and international trips expected to top 1 8 billion by 2030  such rapid expansion plans by hoteliers  bodes well

11184,232699,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry Outlook   July 2017,opinion,"The U S  hotel industry started 2017 on a strong note with solid demand supporting modest growth in both occupancy and average daily rate  ADR  in first quarter 2017  Revenue per available room  RevPAR  also increased 3 4  
This is reflected in the industry s stock price performance  Over the past six months  the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has fared better than the broader S P 500 index  While the industry has gained 12 5   the broader index has added only 6 9  
Despite moderate first quarter GDP growth of 1 2   low oil prices  rising employment  higher real income  and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment  This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel  and higher transaction volumes  which is likely to continue 
Positive economic outlook  GDP projected to rise 2 2  in 2017  is also expected to keep the mood upbeat  supporting continued albeit decelerating growth for the U S  hotel industry for the rest of the year  Even then  peaking supply growth is expected to put pressure on pricing power  thereby tempering the performance somewhat 
What Do Numbers Say 
Statistics underscore the expectation of moderating but positive performance by the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  shows that new supply is likely to rise 2  in 2017  slightly below the anticipated demand growth of 2 1   This is likely to result in a 0 1  rise in occupancy rates in 2017 to 65 5  
Though both ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2 3  in 2017  the rate of increase will likely be less than the average growth recorded in the past few years 
Additionally  as per CBRE Hotels  Americas Research  ADR and RevPAR are expected to rise 2 9  year over year in 2017  while occupancy is projected to inch up 0 1  
Meanwhile  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  fell 2 4  in Jun 2017  However  in the first six months of the year  the index rose 25 4   much higher than its 19 6  rise in the same period last year 
Thus  while overall demand in the U S  is likely to remain strong  driven in part by firming group travel  increasing supply growth is anticipated to lead to stabilizing occupancy levels  ADR and RevPAR are expected to continue to increase  but at a slower pace than earlier expected  impacted in part by comparatively lower growth in the overall economy 
What s Hurting the Hoteliers 
Uncertainty  both international and domestic  continues to weigh on the performance of the U S  lodging industry 
On the one hand  the strengthening U S  dollar and its impact on inbound  international travel is expected to keep the industry s growth at check On the other hand  negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the U S  given the Trump administration s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visasis bad for hotels 
Additionally  higher costs  increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to continue to pose headwinds 
Though prospects of lower taxes  reduced regulations and updated trade policies proposed by the Trump administration should contribute to economic improvement  capital market surge and rising business and consumer confidence  the majority of these changes are unlikely to take effect until at least 2018 
Meanwhile  hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do so  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Moreover  high labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers  and as they won t be able to boost ADRs as much as they would like  their profits may be dented further  In fact  online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN  are also limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  
What Can Drive Growth 
The hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions  So the present solid economic fundamentals that should spur consumer spending in 2017 raises optimism for hoteliers 
Moreover  hoteliers will be able to counter any economic volatility better  if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services 
Particularly  hoteliers must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory  In fact  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and homesharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb  Notably  both Hyatt and Wyndham carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
So far  the hotel industry has proved to be resilient during this marketplace shift  In 2017  too  the industry is estimated to witness continued success 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among millennials   will remain the priorities  Acute  focused investment in infrastructure to attract more business and leisure travelers will also hold the key to growth 
Why Hotel Stocks Still Have Some Upside Left
While the industry has outperformed the broader market over the last five years  it seems there is still a value oriented path ahead  Looking at the industry s EV EBITDA ratio  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization   which is the best multiple for valuing hotels as they are highly capital intensive  investors might still want to pay more 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 10 51  which compares favorably with what it saw in the last five years  The ratio is lower than the average of 12 72 and the high of 17 45 over the last five years 
Moreover  it compares somewhat favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is 10 83 
Overall  the valuation of the industry from an EV EBITDA perspective looks attractive when compared with its own range in the same time period  Moreover  its somewhat lower than market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead

11209,232724,WYND,Market Drifts Higher On Deals,opinion,"Don t try to be all things to all people  Concentrate on selling something unique that you know there is a need for  offer competitive pricing and good customer service    Lilian Vernon

In nearly every field all over the world  competition is part of daily existence  Little kids grow up keeping track of their games at recess  They then adopt a preferred team in their favorite sport and begin to root for winning seasons or even championships  The market in education is ultra competitive to enter the best schools  starting in high school and becoming even more fierce for college and graduate school  Competition in business is extreme in almost any industry and now extends all over the world 
Why does this matter to those of us looking for promising potential investments  The answer has to do with profitability  as the more competition  the harder it is to maintain a sustainable margin  The best example is what has happened to the general retail landscape with the emergence of Amazon com  The whole world knows to price check Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  on nearly any item before buying  It used to be you checked Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  for the lowest price  Both have enormous scale and buy in such quantity to demand massive breaks from vendors  If you are Macy s  Kohl s  Penny s etc  the margin erosion battle is relentless 
It is a prime reason why I think you want to avoid these kinds of industries for long term investments  Instead  I think you are looking for situations with absence of competition  dominance  and above all  big margins  Margin  margin  margin  Easy to say  much harder to find  especially on a sustainable basis  Get hunting 
In the capital markets this week  the earnings parade continued as soft drink and snack behemoth Pepsi  NYSE PEP  spewed a sweet taste for investors  as did credit giant TransUnion  NYSE TRU   Godaddy  NYSE GDDY   known for its interesting commercials  as opposed to just the web site biz   hosted a nice result  Wyndham Resorts  NYSE WYN   a vacation and hotel company  proved yet again it is a consistent operator  Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  has been the  big daddy  for years in communications and remains so  as its figures last week displayed  T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS  posted very strong subscriber numbers and late Friday it appears the parent company of Sprint will make a bid for T  NYSE T   owned by parent Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn   
Also in the deal world  Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  made a bid for Unilever  NYSE UN   which summarily turned down the  50 price offer  Let s take a closer look at this situation because it is quite interesting  although I am referring more to the corporate cultures versus the current market values 
Unilever is an enterprise where the bulk of its competitive advantage resides in emerging markets like India  Africa  Asia  and various parts of Europe  It is known as being very outspoken in favor of sustainable environmental practices and have incorporated this ethos throughout its systems  particularly the supply chain  You could call it one of the leaders of the ethically conscious corporation movement  Kraft  its pursuer  was a spin off of  drum roll please  Phillip Morris  In case you aren t familiar with PM  that would be the largest provider of tobacco related products  you know  cigarettes 
Uh  that might be a little issue with the rank at file at Unilever  right  Well  the largest owner of Kraft Heinz is 3G Capital  who has a big partner named Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   led by  Warren Buffett  Berkshire also is the second largest owner of Kraft as well  So  with Buffet sitting on 100 billion in cash at Berkshire  it could be used to help finance the deal  Of course  the brass at Unilever turned down the 50 buck offer  but 3G is well known for it s  shall we say  tenacity  Having owned Unilever for over a decade  I suspect their management team is not keen to be taken over by Kraft  Get the popcorn out because this one is worth watching

US Hotel Industry Holding Up Well Despite Global Headwinds

	The U S  hotel industry cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms  coming off years of accelerated growth that started in 2010 following the Great Recession 

	On the one hand  apart from softening occupancy levels  negative currency translation  pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raise concerns  On the other  a steady rise in business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers along with strong investor appetite thanks to higher transaction volumes is spreading cheer across the industry 

	Going forward  we expect that the lodging cycle will align with the broader business cycle  Moreover  hoteliers have been moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services to counter economic volatility better 

	Does this mean that the hotel industry is a bowl of cherries  Not really 

What s Hurting the Hoteliers 

	Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  the steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc   Nasdaq    andThe Priceline Group Inc   Nasdaq     are limiting the pricing power of these brands 

	Meanwhile  the slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply are likely to continue to pose headwinds  Particularly in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 

	Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International  Inc   Nasdaq     

The Positives

	Nonetheless  as per the most recent forecast from Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  the U S  hotel industry is projected to experience continued growth through 2017  albeit at a slower rate 

	For full year 2016  the U S  hotel industry is predicted to report flat occupancy growth  and a 3 2  rise in average daily rate  ADR   Revenue per available room  RevPAR  is also anticipated to go up 3 2   with higher ADR being the key RevPAR growth driver 

	Moreover  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  is up 0 4  year to date 

	Additionally  according to STR  RevPAR at U S  hotels was up 5  year over year for the week ended Nov 12  2016 

	Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among the millennials   will remain the priorities 

	Meanwhile  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   NYSE    andWyndham Worldwide Corp   NYSE     are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 

	Notably  all the three companies    Marriott  Hyatt and Wyndham  carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

Zacks Industry Rank   Neutral Outlook

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  we rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   

	As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  

	The Zacks Industry Rank for the Hotels   Motels industry is currently  156  This puts the industry in the middle third of all industries  corresponding to a neutral outlook 

Earnings Trends

	The Hotels   Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector 

	As of Nov 17  94 3  of the Consumer Discretionary companies in the S P 500 index reported their Q3 results  The growth rate for earnings and revenues is 7 6  and 12 2   respectively  Moreover  the beat ratios for this sector are noteworthy  72 7  for earnings and 45 5  for revenues  

	Meanwhile  for 2016  both earnings and revenues for the sector are expected to rise 4 8  and 12 1   respectively 

	However  most of the hoteliers  top line growth was weaker than expectedin the third quarter 2016 earnings season and showed sequential RevPAR growth deceleration 

	For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our     report 

Conclusion

	On the whole  though pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown continue to weigh on sentiment  hoteliers are cautiously optimistic heading into 2017 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

11215,232730,WYND,Vacation On Your Mind  How About Investing In Hotel Stocks ,opinion,"Despite economic and political upheaval in certain pockets all over the world  people are steadfast on spending time with loved ones  They re looking for unique experiences at all price points  and hoteliers believe that their diverse portfolio of travel offerings can continue to deliver on that growing demand 
Thus  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over both the short and the long term  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming years 
Demand Supply Gap  The recovery in the broader economy has been a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and transient business travel demand  According to Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   the supply demand environment in the U S  is favorable  We note that demand growth in the U S  has outpaced supply growth each year since 2010 
Meanwhile  though the gap between demand growth and supply growth continues to narrow and occupancy growth has slowed  higher rates are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR   Considering the long pipeline of hotels  Smith Travel Research  STR  expects the sector s demand and supply growth to be equal at 1 6  in the U S  in 2016 
International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Despite macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies  hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in markets with great long term potential 
A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises lucrative growth opportunities  despite the economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially  moving ahead  In fact  China is the fastest growing lodging market in the world  Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott International  Inc   MAR  
Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Among others  Japan  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers  The key players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure 
Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton  Choice Hotels International Inc   CHH  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  have a strong foothold in this region 
Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel chains are meticulously working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to gain a competitive advantage  Remodeling mostly involves restoration of lobbies and other public spaces  preservation of decorative features if possible  and guestroom upgrades to make the brand more relevant  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the mass market as well as luxury space  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially the luxury segment  hotels will have to differentiate themselves 
Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus the ability to innovate will be their key to success  Therefore  ace hoteliers like Marriott  Belmond Ltd   BEL  and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to sync their brands to the order of the day  All these companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism numbers and their tastes and expectations are widely different from their preceding generations  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation  Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Marriott s Element  Aloft and Edition  Andaz by Hyatt  and InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo 
Loyalty Programs  In order to survive in a tough economic environment  hoteliers are continuously devising newer ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  and offering of loyalty programs is one of them  Thus  hoteliers have been increasingly focusing on their loyalty programs as rewards members stay longer than nonmembers and also generate more in revenue for their franchisees 
Notably  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry  Recently  management announced that Wyndham would be the first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties  Meanwhile  post its acquisition of Starwood  Marriott linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards  and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  The company believes that the linking of the three loyalty programs would lead to an even larger loyalty community 
Loyalty programs are thus the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience 
Embracing Social Media and Smartphone Technology to Build Loyalty  In today s world of price comparison and shared economy  hotels have to constantly push their boundaries to retain customers  In this regard  digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role  Social media can enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests  especially millennials and can  in turn  increase loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers to select hotels  Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and are offering interactive maps GPS to increase occupancy 
In fact  according to Navis  a leading innovative hospitality technology solution provider   which quoted eMarketer s estimates of digital and travel research and booking   51 8  of travelers who book trips digitally in 2016 will do so through a mobile device  This is a sharp uptick from 43 8  in 2015 and highlights the importance of smartphones in online travel 
In fact  mobile check ins and check outs have increased substantially over the past two years as the service is helping guests to use their smart devices to connect with the hotel for faster and seamless check in check out  Hoteliers are therefore looking to introduce responsive designs in their apps  one click booking  and location technology to improve operating efficiencies and enhance guest services  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry 
Many hotel companies are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences   and deliver a differentiated experience   which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more 
Bottom Line
The lodging sector will prove to be a worthy investment proposition in the near  to medium term provided the economy continues to shows signs of recovery  This in turn will perk up investor confidence and lead to greater demand  thereby boosting hoteliers  profitability

	Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus the ability to innovate will be their key to success  Therefore  ace hoteliers like Marriott  Belmond Ltd   NYSE     and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to sync their brands to the order of the day  All these companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

	Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism numbers and their tastes and expectations are widely different from their preceding generations  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation  Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from parent companies  infrastructure

11217,232732,WYND,What Worries Shareholders In The Hotel Industry ,opinion,"Granted  sales have been pretty solid in the U S  and emerging markets have great growth prospects  Still  it would be prudent to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry  Particularly  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spoil the party for hoteliers 
Below  we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term 
Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets  Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in international markets  like the social political impact of the unexpected   Brexit   vote and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia 
Moreover  a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales  In fact  Brazil  Argentina and Ecuador have witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy so far in 2016  The weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil thus led to softer tourism numbers in 2015  which continues in 2016 
Meanwhile  hoteliers like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  expect pandemic virus like Zika to continue to temper growth in the Caribbean region 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Recent terror assaults on key European cities like London  Paris and Brussels have also affected tourism numbers  The attacks in Brussels dealt a severe blow to Europe s tourism industry  just as it was going into the peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks last year  Further  concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
If this wasn t enough  the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns over Japan  owing to a weaker yen and tax increases  are adding to hoteliers  woes  Notably  China s economic growth rate moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25 year low  The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel 
Meanwhile  the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns  political unrest and rising supply  adding to the woes of hoteliers 
Slowing RevPar Trends  Most of the hoteliers in the U S  have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room  RevPAR  trends of late  because of continued muted international visitation along with new supply impact 
In fact  taking into account the impact of a weaker global macro outlook  Marriott lowered its comparable system wide RevPAR expectations on a constant dollar basis to growth of 3  in North America  outside North America and worldwide for full year 2016  Notably  the company had earlier guided for RevPAR growth of 3  to 5  
Moreover  the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions  which mainly include parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia to continue hurting RevPAR 
Fluctuation in Exchange Rates  Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott  Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U S  Notably  all these companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Hence  any unfavorable change in currency may hurt their financials to a great extent  Though the dollar weakened slightly in 2016 compared to the previous year  the negative currency impact is still significant  Meanwhile  Marriott and Wyndham are bearing the brunt of Venezuelan currency devaluation as well 
Thus  such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 
Operating Margins Under Pressure  Operating margins for the hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U S  due to a spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This comes at the cost of near term margins 
Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and The Priceline Group s  PCLN  Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which are contracting their margins  The higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are also seizing share away from traditional players 
Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability  The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers  margins  The law entails hotels with 100 or more full time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full time employees and their dependents beginning this year  Also  from 2016  employers with 50 to 99 full time equivalent employees have also been included under Obamacare  Employers will be suffering penalties for any non compliance  This would continue to raise costs for hoteliers in the near term 
To Conclude
Although various geopolitical   economic woes are threatening RevPar growth in the hotel industry  it remains to be seen whether improving economy and efforts undertaken by hoteliers to increase occupancy can offset these negatives 
Let us see how these companies fare and register profits in the coming days  In    we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward

Disappointing Metrics
STR data for October 2016 indicates that occupancy rates are down In Europe  Middle East and Central South America  Asia and the U S  were flattish 
As far as the average daily rate  ADR  or  pricing   is concerned  there were declines everywhere except in the Americas 
Revenue per average room  revPAR  also wasn t encouraging  declining in Europe  Middle East and Central South America but flattish in Asia and up 1 9  in the U S 
From the above  it appears that the domestic market is the best place to search for growth  But according to STR s updated outlook for 2016 and 2017  things could be turning for the worse  The firm says that while growth in supply and demand will be in equilibrium in 2016 at 1 6   demand will decelerate slightly to 1 5  next year with supply accelerating to 2 0  
The occupancy rate will go from flat to down 0 5   The supply demand mismatch will also impact pricing for hoteliers  As a result  ADR growth will go from 3 1  to 2 8   also impacting the RevPAR    
The numbers indicate that demand is not about to get stronger  And indeed  2017 estimates for some hoteliers are trending down  Mariott for example saw a 6 cent decline in the last 30 days  with Hilton down 8 cents and Expedia down 18 cents  Other estimates can also start trending down in the coming days 
Is It All Bad News 
While growth isn t expected to accelerate in the near term  the domestic market and China Asia are likely to be moderately positive  So people already invested in the space may want to hang on  Here s some more data that investors with a longer investment horizon may cheer at 
According to Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association  IATA   Alexandre de Juniac   September s growth in passenger demand was healthy  Importantly  this rebound from August weakness suggests that travel demand is showing its resilience in the aftermath of terror attacks 
 We must  of course  be ever alert to the ongoing terror threat  And overall the industry is still vulnerable to being buffeted by rising geopolitical tensions  protectionist political agendas  and weak economic fundamentals  This will still be a good year for the airline industry s performance  but our profitability will continue to be hard won  
Investors can find opportunities in both the fastest growing countries of China and India 
In China  there is a restriction on foreign ownership of aircraft and airports  But investment opportunity exists as parts suppliers to aircraft companies and designers of airports according to Dezan Shira and Associates 
The opportunity in India is opening up with the Modi government publishing the country s first ever Civil Aviation Policy allowing the privatization of airlines and up to 100  FDI in Indian airlines companies among other things  But the segment is necessarily heavily regulated because of its relation to national security and also heavily taxed  There is also mounting pressure for India to join the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  that seeks to get member countries to offset the environmental impact of future air traffic growth  India has managed to stay out of this to date  if it decides to join  there can be cost escalation 
Travel can be for both business and leisure although a recent study from Priceline says that people are generally more open to mix the two these days  i e  extend the business trip to enjoy the destination 
Also  McKinsey finds that business travel in Asia is rather different from other parts of the world  The world s biggest business travel market with a 38  share worth a trillion dollars in annual spending is characterized by greater choice to individual travelers 
On the basis of a survey of 2 500 business travelers in China  India  Indonesia  Japan and Singapore and interviews of 19 corporate travel managers  the study finds that 69  of respondents are able to choose their airlines  either from a preapproved list or without restrictions of which 11  have no constraints on either provider or price  Similarly  74  of respondents said they have the same degree of freedom in picking a hotel  of which 9  said they have no restrictions whatsoever 
On the other hand  companies at times incentivize employees to accept cheaper travel options  So the distinction between business and leisure type travel is less evident here  Business travelers in Asia generally prefer convenience over all else and are therefore very inclined to order online using mobile devices and through online booking agents 
According to the latest Visa sponsored GBTA BTI Outlook   China 2016 H1  China has overtaken the U S  as the largest business travel market in the world  Moreover  it is also one of the fastest growing  10 1  growth in 2016 followed by 9 8  growth in 2017   Domestic spend is 95  of total spend  The report also mentions the estimated U S  growth rate for 2016 of 1 9  
The GBTA BTI Outlook   India report says that the country is currently the 10th largest business travel market in the world  forecasted to grow 10 7  this year and 10 2  in 2017 and assume the sixth position by 2019  Domestic spending will grow 11 5  and 10 3  in 2016 and 2017  respectively  Outbound travel will be slower  growing a respective 3 1  and 9 0  
According to the Visa sponsored GBTA BTI Outlook   Western Europe  the region will see 6 3  growth in 2016 followed by 6 8  growth in 2017  Germany leads the region and in addition to the UK  will see higher growth rates 
Summing Up
The travel market has few good opportunities at the moment  Instead see     But it isn t all doom and gloom either  If you re in the segment for the longer term  it makes sense to hold on  But this isn t the time to make fresh investments and a wait and see approach to Asian opportunities may be a good idea

	Chicago  IL   November 29  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Marriott  NASDAQ     Hilton  NYSE     Priceline  NASDAQ     Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   NASDAQ     and Southwest  NYSE      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

Avoid Travel Stocks for Now

	By travel stocks I mean hotel stocks like Marriott  NASDAQ      Hilton  NYSE      and  Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN   online hotel booking companies like Priceline  NASDAQ     and Expedia  NASDAQ        recommendation sites like TripAdvisor and other players facilitating or indirectly involved in the travel business 

	The segment has suffered the brunt of terror attacks  Brexit uncertainties and the stronger dollar  which combined to contain hotel demand for much of the year  The question  then  is whether the weakness will continue  for these or other reasons   or is it time to look beyond these issues to more positive indicators perhaps 

	Another segment that benefits from travel demand is airlines and as it turns out  companies like Southwest  NYSE      also share the terror and Brexit issues  They are also saddled with rising labor costs and declining air fares 

	Low oil prices have been a positive  however    on the one hand increasing consumer disposable income  and on the other supporting airlines profitability  It s a different matter that capacity additions seem high in response to the rising demand  which is impacting air fares

11221,232736,WYND,Hotel Industry Stock Outlook   November 2016,opinion,"US Hotel Industry Holding Up Well Despite Global Headwinds
The U S  hotel industry cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms  coming off years of accelerated growth that started in 2010 following the Great Recession 
On the one hand  apart from softening occupancy levels  negative currency translation  pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raise concerns  On the other  a steady rise in business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers along with strong investor appetite thanks to higher transaction volumes is spreading cheer across the industry 
Going forward  we expect that the lodging cycle will align with the broader business cycle  Moreover  hoteliers have been moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services to counter economic volatility better 
Does this mean that the hotel industry is a bowl of cherries  Not really 
What s Hurting the Hoteliers 
Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  the steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN  are limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Meanwhile  the slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply are likely to continue to pose headwinds  Particularly in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  
The Positives
Nonetheless  as per the most recent forecast fromSmith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  the U S  hotel industry is projected to experience continued growth through 2017  albeit at a slower rate 
For full year 2016  the U S  hotel industry is predicted to report flat occupancy growth  and a 3 2  rise in average daily rate  ADR   Revenue per available room  RevPAR  is also anticipated to go up 3 2   with higher ADR being the key RevPAR growth driver 
Moreover  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  is up 0 4  year to date 
Additionally  according to STR  RevPAR at U S  hotels was up 5  year over year for the week ended Nov 12  2016 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among the millennials   will remain the priorities 
Meanwhile  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 
Notably  all the three companies    Marriott  Hyattand Wyndham  carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Zacks Industry Rank   Neutral Outlook

Earnings Trends

Meanwhile  for 2016  both earnings and revenues for the sector are expected to rise 4 8  and 12 1   respectively 
However  most of the hoteliers  top line growth was weaker than expectedin the third quarter 2016 earnings season and showed sequential RevPAR growth deceleration

On the whole  though pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown continue to weigh on sentiment  hoteliers are cautiously optimistic heading into 2017

In a 2015   Dreman said this about low PE stocks 

 Low PE  multiples  have always outperformed the market enormously over 10  15 and 20 years  For example  we did a 35 year study where if an institutional investor had  1 million  he d have about  250 million at the end of those 35 years  This is against half of that for the S P and much less for higher PE stocks  

I used the finbox io stock screener to find stocks included in the Russell 1000 index that may be considered  out of favor   The specific screen criteria 
PE multiple   14 0x  represents the bottom 20  of Russell 1000 companies 
Free cash flow yield   8   represents the bottom 20  of Russell 1000 companies 
Trailing twelve month earnings growth   0 
Stock price is currently trading at less than 120  of its 52 week low  another helpful out of favor indicator 
Only 10 stocks fit the above criteria 10 Out of Favor StocksHere are the summary stats of the screen results Note that the five year return for this ten company index  142   significantly outperformed the S P 500  88 9   over the same period  However  notice below how this same ten company index significantly underperformed the S P 500 over the last year The chart below highlights the trailing twelve month PE multiples over the last 5 years for the ten company index vs the S P 500  all equally weighted  Source  CapitalIQ

11252,232767,WYND,Airbnb Could Be The Biggest IPO Of 2017,opinion,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky  CEO   Joe Gebbia  CPO   and Nathan Blecharczyk  CTO   Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses  apartments  guest rooms  etc   on either platform  Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone 
Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have  With over 2 million listings worldwide including 1 400 castles it operates in over 34 000 cities and 191 countries  with a total guest list of more than 60 million people 
Airbnb as a Lifestyle
Back in 2014  Airbnb announced a huge  company wide rebranding  indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand  Since its inception  it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option  taking on big industry names like Wyndham   NYSE WYN    Hyatt   NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide   NYSE H   and InterContinental Hotels   NYSE IHG   
But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more  In a   the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products  houses  and businesses  to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal but  more importantly  a supporter of their brand 
Dubbed B lo  its logo is a symbol of belonging  While it may look like a misshapen paperclip  B lo is a  symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences  new cultures  and new conversations   Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app  which are now far cleaner than previous versions  and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery 
The desire of a company to be more than its services is reminiscent of Shake Shack   NYSE H    the better for you New York City burger joint who went public in 2015  Shake Shack is finding great success by promoting themselves as a lifestyle brand  as well as putting themselves into the  fine casual  dining category 
So  what can Airbnb learn from this burger restaurant  Like Shake Shack did  would Airbnb benefit by staying private longer  Could extra time help the company reinforce reserves  address weaknesses  and plan for the future 
Controversies to Consider
Airbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry  but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels 
In San Francisco  critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over  3 900 average monthly rent  Average home prices in the city just hit the  1 1 million median mark  and San Francisco s population has reached an all time high  according to Paragon Real Estate Group  
Despite the absence of a permit  which  according to law  one must have in order to rent for under 30 days  San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb  And recently  legislation was approved in San Francisco that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city  hindering a person s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forward
The company is also embroiled in a long standing battle with New York City  where they face similar issues as in San Francisco  Recently  the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal  which  not surprisingly  thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand in the area  If Gov  Andrew Cuomo decides to sign the bill into law  some have calculated that it would delete roughly half of current Airbnb listings in New York 
The penalties for breaking the law will likely be harsh  with fines of  1 000 hitting providers of short term apartment rentals for the first offense and up to  7 500 by the third violation 
IPO Buzz
Since 2014  and regardless of its fight with certain cities  rumors have been swirling of Airbnb s inevitable initial public offering  even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal  Chesky said that  we will do it at a time when it benefits the company  when we have a good reason  
Airbnb s last valuation clocked in at  25 5 billion  but the company reportedly just raised  850 million in August  putting its total equity funding at about  3 2 billion at a valuation of  and making it the second most valuable U S  startup behind Uber  This  as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and increasingly popular  sharing economy   is helping raise buzz  Their popularity among venture capitalists  VCs  is helping increase hype  too 
However  this new round of funding  in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy  200 million in stock from Airbnb employees  could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO  Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash  allowing it to spend enough money to continue its global expansion without going public 
But like other tech startups  Airbnb is a company for the digital age  and VCs are clamoring to be the first ones to invest in its expected success  Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years specifically  in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service 
According to Neil Sequeira  managing director of VC firm General Catalyst Partners in Palo Alto  California  these types of companies are well liked among investors  Particularly  Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run  it doesn t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff  The company is also easy to grow quickly  as there is no need for a physical office in every country  just consumers with a smartphone 
 The reason they make better investments is they are very high margin at scale you re basically closing a transaction  You don t get that dirty   said Sequeira 
How Might Airbnb Perform 
Like any tech startup  Airbnb s IPO will be a toss up  Its tentative valuation of  30 billion is impressive in and of itself  and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market 
Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition  Companies like     and the Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   owned  all have a dedicated following of their own  and are all beginning to eat into the market share 
Despite rival companies and regulatory issues  Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs  With billions of dollars in investments already  a thriving rebranding  and its rising popularity among travelers  Airbnb s IPO is one to watch out for

	Chicago  IL   October 03  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Marriott  NASDAQ     Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  NYSE      Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE     and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   NYSE      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Marriott Poised to Grow on Starwood Takeover Despite Risks

	On Sep 29  we issued an updated research report on Marriott  NASDAQ        Marriott recently completed its previously announced acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   which led to the creation of the world s largest hotel company  After getting the much awaited approval from the Chinese regulatory agency  MOFCOM   both the companies closed the transaction shortly 

	The combined entity would now operate or franchise more than 5 700 hotels which comprise around 1 1 million rooms globally  bringing together 30 brands catering to all lodging segments 
	Meanwhile  with economic boost and an improvement in business and leisure travel  Marriott is well poised to grow in the near as well as long term 
	Apart from focusing on the lucrative domestic market  Marriott is consistently striving to expand its international footprint  especially in Asia  Middle East  Europe and Latin America  The acquisition of Starwood also bode well in this regard as it would greatly expand Marriott s reach in Europe and Latin America markets 
	Other hoteliers like Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  NYSE     Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE     andHilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   NYSE      are also capitalizing on growing prospects in the international markets 
	Further  Marriott is significantly investing in technology for hotel bookings  in order to improve guest experience  which in turn should boost occupancy  Moreover  frequent share buybacks and continuous increase in quarterly dividend payments further affirm the company s optimistic outlook and growth prospects 
	However  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies might spell trouble for Marriott  Particularly  the slowdown in the Chinese economy is hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel  Also  in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after the U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc 
	Meanwhile  in the domestic market  the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in supply of hotels  which is limiting room rents  thereby hurting RevPAR in the region  Further  in Houston  RevPAR is expected to be sluggish due to weakness in the energy sector 
	Also  Marriott is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates  given its significant international presence

11259,232774,WYND,The Real Truth About Millennial Investors,opinion,"We ve finally reached late August  meaning your Facebook newsfeed is probably brimming with children and teenagers sporting brand new sneakers and backpacks in preparation for their first day of school 
Maybe one or two of your young ones are heading back this week or next  If so  I wish them all the best this year  and I hope you enjoy and cherish watching them grow 
It s also around this time that hundreds of thousands of 18 year olds will be attending their very first day of college or university  This cohort  born mostly in 1998  is among the youngest of millennials  the generation born between 1980 and 2000 
According to Census Bureau data  millennials are now the most populous adult segment in U S  history  83 1 million strong as of last summer   By comparison  baby boomers number 75 4 million  
This is why I find it so crucial to keep up with the trends  lifestyles and spending habits of this important group  not least of all because my own two sons belong to it   Any investment manager would be wise to do the same  Millennials are often characterized as entitled  lazy and disengaged  but many of these perceptions fail to stand up to scrutiny when we consider what they ve already achieved in the information technology space 
If you regularly use Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB   Airbnb  Uber  Pinterest  Dropbox or any number of other popular apps valued in the tens of billions  you benefit from the work and imagination of entrepreneurs who came of age sometime during George W  Bush s eight year presidency 
There s no getting around it  Millennials are our future leaders  innovators  consumers and investors  By 2020 a mere four years from now they will make up an estimated 50 percent of the global workforce  What s more  they re expected to control between  19 trillion and  24 trillion on a global scale  according to consulting firm Deloitte 
Twenty four trillion dollars  Let that sink in for a moment 
The First Digital Natives One of the best ways to get a clear sense of the world this group has come of age in  I ve found  is the  Every August since 1998  Beloit College has put together a list of cultural touchstones that helped shape and influence the current incoming class of college freshmen 
Last year  I was fascinated to learn that the class of 2019 has  to answer their questions  always treated Wi Fi as an entitlement  always known marijuana as a legal therapeutic substance in a growing number of states 
This year s list for the class of 2020 is no less eye opening  Below  I ve selected several points that illustrate millennials  close relationship with digital technology 
There has always been a digital swap meet called eBay 
They have never had to watch or listen to programs at a scheduled time 
If you want to reach them  you d better send a text emails are oft ignored 
Books have always been read to you on audible com 
Bluetooth has always been keeping us wireless and synchronized 
Airline tickets have always been purchased online 
Taken together  these observations shed some light on the expectations millennials have of their brands and services expectations such as convenience  immediacy  transparency and a strong sense of community 
It doesn t matter how iconic or longstanding a brand is  If it fails to deliver on these expectations  83 million millennials will antiquate it   Remember Blockbuster   Word of mouth is as important as ever  but the scope has vastly been broadened since their parents and grandparents  time  from a handful of neighbors and acquaintances to a digital sea of millions 
Social Responsibility Matters More so than past generations  millennials are mindful of ethical business practices and base many of their spending and investment decisions on those practices 
A recent study conducted by marketing tech firm Adroit Digital found that 38 percent of millennial consumers will drop a brand for another if it s alleged to be doing  bad business  consciously polluting a river  for example  or mistreating workers 
That social awareness translates to the investment side  even among wealthy investors  A vast majority of younger high net worth individuals  HNWIs   defined as those controlling wealth greater than  10 million  expect their money managers to  screen investments based on environmental  social and governance factors   according to FactSet 
Sixty one percent of millennials see these factors as essential  more than double the rate of their 55 and older peers 

Proceeding with Caution The 2008 2009 financial crisis had a huge  lasting impact on young investors  who might have seen the value of their parents  401 k s and portfolios cut nearly in half  As a result  many twenty and thirty somethings tend to be a bit more cautious and conservative with their finances than Mom and Dad 
Consider this  In December 2015  UBS surveyed 2 638 affluent investors  including 584 millennials  on their investment attitudes  As a group  millennials maintained a larger cash holding than older generations  41 percent on average  compared to Generation X s 28 percent and baby boomers  20 percent  and were unsatisfied with how their portfolios were positioned  Only 15 percent claimed they were  very happy   compared to 32 percent of Generation X and 50 percent of baby boomers 
This could partially explain why millennials also have a much greater propensity to rent instead of commit to buying which  in turn  helps explain the meteoric rise of  sharing economy  pioneers such as Uber  now worth more than Ford and GM  and Airbnb  worth more than Hyatt and Wyndham Worldwide  
Meanwhile  younger and lower income Americans are less likely than their older peers to participate in investments such as mutual funds  This is worrisome  especially since they themselves are skeptical of Social Security s longevity  According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies  TCRS   as many as 80 percent of millennials fear Social Security will no longer be around by the time they retire 
Fortunately  we have a solution 
Dollar Cost Averaging For many cautious millennials  taking a more long term  disciplined approach to investing makes sense  This can be achieved through dollar cost averaging  an investment technique that lets you invest a fixed amount in a specific investment at regular  automatic intervals often just  100 per month 
Think of it like dipping your foot into a lake inch by inch  instead of taking a running leap off a 20 foot cliff

11261,232776,WYND,France Bleeds Again  ETFs   Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Within less than a year  France met with its second terror attack on Thursday  Over 80 people were killed and around 18 injured when a heavy truck smashed a mass watching Bastille Day fireworks in the French Riviera city of Nice 
Eight months back  Paris had encountered the worst terror attack in Europe in over a decade  A chain of Islamic State backed terrorist attacks had killed around 130 people and left hundreds injured  read    
How Will the Investing World React 
The recent upsurge in terrorism is not only a threat to mankind  but also to the global investing space  Global stocks are expected to dive as risk on sentiments will be hurt by this attack  though stocks are showing resilience as of now 
Needless to say  the epicenter of the crisis   France   will be the worst hit with French stocks likely to be under pressure in the coming few days  iShares MSCI France ETF  will likely bear the brunt of this likely sell off 
However  among all asset classes and sectors  there are a few sectors that are likely to be hit hard while some may gain  Below we highlight those sectors that are in focus after the Nice attack 
Likely Losers
Hospitality 
Since tourism and hospitality sectors are hit hard after a terror attack in any place  France will also likely see the same fate  Not only France  big European cities that are the soft targets of terrorist groups might see a fallback in their tourism and hotel industry  Notably  the tourist industry accounts for about  of the French economy Thanks to this fear for tourism  big U S  based hotel chains that have considerable exposure in Europe  may see retreating share price  Marriott International Inc     NASDAQ MAR     Hyatt Hotels Corporation   NYSE H   and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation   NYSE WYN   are some such companies  Not only hotels  since travelers are likely to abandon cruise trips  Carnival  LON CCL  Corporation    NYSE CCL    and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd     NYSE RCL    might be in a tight spot in the coming days Notably  consumer discretionary ETF PowerShares DWA Consumer Cyclicals Momentum Portfolio   AX PEZ   invests over 16  in Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure  and may thus feel the pressure 
Airlines Needless to say  lower tourism and business travel means lesser air travel  Though the impact of the attack is likely to be short lived  travelers might take some more time to get back to their previous euphoria  shrugging off all fears  The pure play Airline ETF U S  GLOBAL JETS ETF   NS JET   could thus see losses in the coming days  Another product PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Portfolio  also invests considerably in the airlines sector  read    
Potential Gainers 
Social Media 
People around the world will likely take the social media route to condemn the attack and express their solidarity with the sufferers  This in turn should boost social media stocks like Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Twitter   NYSE TWTR    giving the pure play social media ETF Global X Social Media Index ETF   CM SOCL   reasons to surge ahead  read    
Defense 
Such back to back attacks in different parts of the globe once again fortifies the need for a strong defense base  After all  such geo political risks are favorable for weapon manufacturers and defense contractors 
In any case  the sector is in good shape and may inch up in the coming days pushing iShares US Aerospace and Defense ETF   HN ITA    SPDR S P Aerospace   Defense ETF    LON XAR    andPowerShares Aerospace   Defense Portfolio     read    
Cyber Security 
Along with defense  the need for more cyber security has become more obvious  In fact  many have contemplated whether governments should have an access to technology that reserves the confidentiality of people s correspondence  for the sake   at the time of the Paris attack 
All these talks and urgencies may put cyber security stocks and the related ETFs  namely PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF   NYSE H   and First Trust NASDAQ CEA Cybersecurity ETF  in focus in the coming days

11262,232777,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry Stock Outlook   July 2016,opinion,"The U S  hotel industry slowed down in the first half of 2016 compared to 2015 levels  Apart from a decline in occupancy levels in the first half  negative currency translation and pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raised concerns 
However  business and leisure travel increased on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers  Moreover  hoteliers have realized that franchising their brand and services is better than owning real estate to counter economic volatility 
The Positives
Notwithstanding the macroeconomic hurdles  the lodging sector is expected to grow in the second half of 2016  thanks to strong investor appetite  increasing travel demand and higher transaction volumes 
As per the summer forecast fromSmith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry the U S  hotel industry is expected to experience record high room demand during the Jun to Aug 2016 phase  STR stated that the number of rooms sold during the summer months is estimated to inch up roughly 2 1  on a year over year basis  banking on the current trend in the U S 
However  a healthy supply pipeline is anticipated to lead to a 1 7  increase in the number of rooms available and is likely to keep occupancy growth subdued at 0 4   Moreover  hoteliers are not likely to raise prices to match 2015 levels 
Nonetheless  as per STR  the average daily rate  ADR  at U S  hotels is expected to go up 4  in 2016  Further  mega sporting events like the Olympics in Brazil in August should boost tourism in the second half 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among millennials   will remain their priorities 
What s Hurting the Hoteliers 
Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on the growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN  are limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Statistics further underscore the slowing down in the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers   PwC   shows that occupancy levels at U S  hotels have begun to stabilize after reaching peak levels in 2015  PwC also lowered the 2016 and 2017 revenue per available room  RevPAR  growth outlook for hotels to 4 6  and 3 7   respectively  Notably  RevPARgrowth in 2015 was 6 2  
The slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply growth are expected to pose headwinds  Moreover  in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies like Airbnb  which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing shares from giants like Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   HOT   Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  
Nonetheless  Marriott s deal to acquire Starwood Hotels is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb                            
Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  we rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   
As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  
The Zacks Industry Rank for the Hotels   Motels industry currently stands at  207  This puts the industry in the lower third of all industries  corresponding to a negative outlook  Most of the hoteliers have been witnessing declining occupancy numbers in many markets  primarily due to economic and political challenges  which possibly had an adverse impact on the industry rating 
Earnings Trends
The hotel industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector 
If we look at the overall results of the sector  earnings grew 8 1  in the March quarter while total revenues rose 6 2  in the quarter 
Meanwhile  for the June quarter  though revenues are expected to rise 3 4   earnings are projected to decline 1 4   However  for 2016  both earnings and revenues are expected to rise 4 3  and 5 4   respectively 
For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our    report 
How Will the Players Fare This Earnings Season 
A look at the table below shows that four of the five largest hoteliers carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank   which does not speak well for the hotel industry at the moment 
A look at the  does not clearly show that any hotelier is likely to beat expectations when it reports its next quarterly result in July August 
Conclusion
On the whole  while increasing supply growth is expected to limit occupancy levels  overall demand conditions in the U S  is expected to remain positive on the back of firming group travel  Average daily rates are likely to continue increasing  albeit at a slower pace than earlier expected because of sluggish growth in the overall economy  Meanwhile  lingering uncertainty in some of the international markets is likely to remain an overhang

11263,232778,WYND,Vacations On Your Mind  Invest In Hotel Stocks ,opinion,"The hotel industry has been on the path of recovery for some time now  supported by stronger economic metrics and the increasingly positive employment scenario  Notably  despite economic and political upheaval in certain pockets around the world  demand remains strong and sales have been robust in the U S  However  declining occupancy levels are a concern 
Nonetheless  on the brighter side  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over both the short and the long term  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming years 
Demand Exceeds Supply  The recovery in the broader economy has been a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and transient business travel demand  According to Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   the supply demand environment in the U S  is favorable as demand growth is better than supply  which is below the long term average  This would lead to an increase in rates  thereby driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  
We note that demand growth in the U S  has outpaced supply growth each year since 2010  Meanwhile  though the gap between demand growth and supply growth continues to narrow and occupancy growth has slowed  higher rates are expected to keep driving RevPAR  Moreover  in spite of the large pipeline of hotels  Smith Travel Research  STR  expects the sector s demand growth in 2016 to be 2 1  in the U S  with only 1 7  increase in supply 
International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Despite the macroeconomic concerns in several of the emerging economies  hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in markets with great long term potential 
A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises lucrative growth opportunities  despite the economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially in the second half of 2016  In fact  the country is a major revenue contributor for both Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   HOT  and Marriott International  Inc   MAR  
Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Among others  Japan  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers  Major players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure 
Meanwhile  growth in Brazil and Argentina continues to be sluggish  mainly due to economic slowdown in Latin America  However  Brazil is scheduled to host a mega sporting event    the 2016 Summer Olympics in August    which should boost tourism to a certain extent 
Meanwhile  Europe still remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite the repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  have a strong foothold in this region 
Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel chains are meticulously working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to gain a competitive advantage  Remodeling mostly involves restoration of lobbies and other public spaces  preservation of decorative features if possible  and guestroom upgrades to make the brand more relevant  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the mass market as well as the luxury space  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially the luxury segment  hotels will have to differentiate themselves 
Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus the ability to innovate will be the key to success  Therefore  many leading hoteliers like Starwood  Marriott  Belmond Ltd   BEL  and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to make their brands more relevant in today s environment 
Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism numbers who have a different horizon of expectation than their preceding generations  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation 
Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Starwood s Element and Aloft  Marriott s Edition  Andaz by Hyatt and InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo 
Building Loyalty through Social Media and the Smartphone Technology  In today s age of price comparisons and the increasing norm of a sharing economy  hotels have to constantly push their boundaries to retain customers  In this regard  digital innovation and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in the hotel industry  Social media can enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests  especially the millennials and can  in turn  increase loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers select hotels 
Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and are offering interactive maps GPS as well as reward programs to increase occupancy  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry 
In fact  according to Navis  a leading innovative hospitality technology solution provider    which quoted eMarketer s latest estimates of digital and travel research and booking    51 8  of travelers who book trips digitally in 2016 will do so through a mobile device  This is a sharp uptick from 43 8  in 2015  and highlights the importance of smartphones in online travel 
Hoteliers are therefore looking to introduce responsive designs in their apps  one click booking  and location technology to improve operating efficiencies and enhance guest services 
Many hotel companies are setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences    and deliver a differentiated experience    which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more  Loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience 
Among the bullish hotel stocks we currently have Intrawest Resorts Holdings  Inc   SNOW   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Belmond  BEL   holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Despite being Zacks Ranked  3  Hold  stocks  we are also optimistic about Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp   VAC   Red Lion Hotels Corp   RLH   China Lodging Group  Ltd   HTHT  and La Quinta Holdings Inc   LQ   given the momentum in their underlying businesses 
Bottom Line
An anticipated and typically strong summer for U S  hotels is expected to drive profitability and boost investor confidence  In that case  the lodging sector will prove to be a worthy investment proposition for the second half of 2016 provided the economy shows signs of recovery  which it already is  However  concerns related to a moderately sluggish economy and political trouble elsewhere will remain as headwinds 
But there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the hotel industry over the long haul in an increasingly globalized world  Does this mean investing in the space right now is the right option

11264,232779,WYND,Hotels Stocks Pay The Price Of Economic Woes  Terror Attacks,opinion,"Granted  sales in the hotel industry have been pretty solid in the U S   and emerging markets have great growth prospects  But it would still be prudent for investors to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry  Particularly  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spell trouble for the hoteliers 
Below  we discuss some of the headwinds that the hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term 
Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets  Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in the international markets  like the social political impact of the unexpected   Brexit   vote and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia 
Moreover  high inflation rates and currency devaluation in Latin America  especially Brazil and Argentina  have arrested overall sales  Brazil  Argentina and Ecuador witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy in the first half of 2016  The weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil  led to softer tourism numbers in 2015  which continued through the first half of 2016 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by the economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Recent terror attacks on key European cities like London  Paris and Brussels have also affected tourism numbers  The attacks in Brussels dealt a severe blow to Europe s tourism industry  just as it was going into peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks last year  Further  concerns of more terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting the trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
If that wasn t enough  the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns about Japan  owing to a weaker yen and tax increases  are adding to the hoteliers  woes  Notably  the economic growth rate of China moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25 year low  The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel 
Meanwhile  the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns  political unrest and rising supply 
In fact  a majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions  which mainly include parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia to continue hurting RevPAR  However  with oil prices on the rise again  demand trends could improve in these regions 
Meanhwile  taking into account the impact of a weaker global macro outlook  Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   HOT  reduced its guidance range for worldwide  system wide constant dollar RevPAR to 2  to 4  
Fluctuation in Exchange Rates  Most of the major hoteliers generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U S  Hence  any unfavorable change in currency may hurt their financials to a great extent  Though the dollar weakened slightly in 2016 compared to the previous year  the negative currency impact is still significant 
As Starwood has a significant international presence  management has guided foreign exchange headwinds to negatively impact full year earnings by around  17 million in 2016  Meanwhile  Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are bearing the brunt of the Venezuelan currency devaluation 
Such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of the hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 
Operating Margins Under Pressure  Though revenue per available room  RevPAR  has fairly picked up since the industry started recovering in 2009  operating margins are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U S  due to a spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This comes at the cost of near term margins 
Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and The Priceline Group s  PCLN  Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which are contracting their margins  Further  the higher commission rates charged for the hotels are hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are also grabbing share away from traditional players 
Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability  The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers  margins  The law entails hotels with 100 or more full time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full time employees and their dependents beginning this year 
Also  from 2016  employers with 50 to 99 full time equivalent employees have also been included under this Act  Notably  employers will be suffering penalties for any non compliance  This would continue to raise costs for hoteliers in the near term 
Some of the players in the space induce our cautious to bearish outlook  Currently  Starwood  Marriott   Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H   Extended Stay America  Inc   STAY  and Choice Hotels International Inc   CHH  have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   while Intercontinental Hotels Group  LON IHG  plc  IHG  carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Bottom Line
As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the hotel industry over the long term  But what about investing in the space right now  Are there opportunities for short term investors

Meanwhile  growth in Brazil and Argentina continues to be sluggish  mainly due to economic slowdown in Latin America  However  Brazil is scheduled to host a mega sporting event    the 2016 Summer Olympics in August    which should boost tourism to a certain extent 

Meanwhile  Europe still remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite the repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton  and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation    have a strong foothold in this region

Chicago  IL   July 22  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Hotels  part 3  including Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc      Marriott International  Inc      Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN       Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE      and Priceline Group     

Industry  Hotels  part 3

Granted  sales in the hotel industry have been pretty solid in the U S   and emerging markets have great growth prospects  But it would still be prudent for investors to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry  Particularly  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spell trouble for the hoteliers 

Below  we discuss some of the headwinds that the hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term 

Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets   Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in the international markets  like the social political impact of the unexpected   Brexit   vote and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia 

Moreover  high inflation rates and currency devaluation in Latin America  especially Brazil and Argentina  have arrested overall sales  Brazil  Argentina and Ecuador witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy in the first half of 2016  The weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil  led to softer tourism numbers in 2015  which continued through the first half of 2016 

In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by the economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 

Recent terror attacks on key European cities like London  Paris and Brussels have also affected tourism numbers  The attacks in Brussels dealt a severe blow to Europe s tourism industry  just as it was going into peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks last year  Further  concerns of more terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting the trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 

If that wasn t enough  the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns about Japan  owing to a weaker yen and tax increases  are adding to the hoteliers  woes  Notably  the economic growth rate of China moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25 year low  The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel 

Meanwhile  the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns  political unrest and rising supply 

In fact  a majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions  which mainly include parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia to continue hurting RevPAR  However  with oil prices on the rise again  demand trends could improve in these regions 

Meanhwile  taking into account the impact of a weaker global macro outlook  Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide Inc      reduced its guidance range for worldwide  system wide constant dollar RevPAR to 2  to 4  

Fluctuation in Exchange Rates   Most of the major hoteliers generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U S  Hence  any unfavorable change in currency may hurt their financials to a great extent  Though the dollar weakened slightly in 2016 compared to the previous year  the negative currency impact is still significant 

As Starwood has a significant international presence  management has guided foreign exchange headwinds to negatively impact full year earnings by around  17 million in 2016  Meanwhile  Marriott International  Inc     and Wyndham Worldwide Corp     are bearing the brunt of the Venezuelan currency devaluation 

Such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of the hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 

Operating Margins Under Pressure   Though revenue per available room  RevPAR  has fairly picked up since the industry started recovering in 2009  operating margins are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U S  due to a spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This comes at the cost of near term margins 

Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc     and The Priceline Group s    Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which are contracting their margins  Further  the higher commission rates charged for the hotels are hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are also grabbing share away from traditional players 

Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability   The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers  margins  The law entails hotels with 100 or more full time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full time employees and their dependents beginning this year 

Also  from 2016  employers with 50 to 99 full time equivalent employees have also been included under this Act  Notably  employers will be suffering penalties for any non compliance  This would continue to raise costs for hoteliers in the near term

11281,232796,WYND,Are Hotels Empty  Stocks Are Making It Look That Way,opinion,"That is what you would think from their stock charts  Hotel stocks are looking like every boss everywhere is about to mandate video conferencing instead of face to face discussions and families have all decided to go camping instead of a proper holiday this summer  Here are a few to look at 

Choice Hotels  CHH  is sitting on a support resistance zone that has been important since last July  With a Marubozu like candle Thursday and a falling RSI and MACD the prospects are for a breakdown and continuation lower  Under 43 70 the next support shows up at 41 70 and then 39 80 
I just stayed in a Hyatt  H  the other night and it was quite pleasant  crowded and generally buzzing  But the chart shows the stock is moving lower through a support zone with a falling RSI and MACD and a gap just a few points below 

Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN  is pressing on support as well  The RSI is on the edge of a move into bear territory with a MACD heading lower  both supporting the downside  and a cool 5  run to the 200 day SMA below

11282,232797,WYND,Is Hotel Industry In Honeymoon Period ,opinion,"The hotel industry has bounced back since the sales plunge during the global financial crisis  In spite of some economic and political blotches all over the world  sales have risen overall and are rather robust in the U S 
There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over the short and medium term  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming months and quarters Demand Exceeds Supply  The gradual recovery in the broader economy is a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and transient business travel demand  With limited supply and strong demand  room rates are seeing an uptrend 
According to Hyatt Hotels Corporation Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE H  and Hilton Worldwide  NYSE HLT   the supply demand environment in the U S  is favorable as demand growth is better than supply  which is still below the long term average  This would lead to rate increases  and thereby drive revenue per available room  RevPAR   In fact  despite the large pipeline of hotels  Smith Travel Research  STR  expects the sector s demand growth in 2015 to be 2 4  in the U S  with only 1 3  increase in supply The North American Recovery  System wide occupancies in North America appear pretty steady and are above the prior peak achieved in 2006 following the gradual economic recovery  Easier lending standards  and an improving travel and tourism industry  have also poised hotel companies for growth  For Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT   North America is still the largest market where it plans to open most of its hotels  The company expects 2015 to be yet another year of robust growth in this region International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and in the outlying areas surrounding major cities  These markets offer greater potential due to the higher pace of economic growth  and the outlying mature markets that enjoy proximity to the city centER  A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets of the Asia Pacific  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  despite its economic slowdown  China promises lucrative growth opportunities with visits expected to increase substantially in 2015  In fact  China is a major revenue contributor to both Starwood Hotels and Marriot International  NASDAQ MAR  
The improvement in the Chinese tourism industry  propelled by increased discretionary income and relaxed visa restrictions from popular tourist destinations  is anticipated to be alarming in 2015 and beyond  Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for western hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  India has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Major players in the industry are also eying high potential countries such as Turkey  United Arab Emirates  UAE  and South Korea which offer strong infrastructure  Growth in Brazil and Argentina continue to be sluggish  despite the impact of the FIFA World Cup held in mid 2014  Brazil is scheduled to host another mega sporting event   2016 Summer Olympics   which should boost tourism  The European market is also improving  In fact  select markets in Southern Europe that were hit hard by the recession  are witnessing growth  The bullish trend can be validated by Starwood s system wide occupancy data in 2014  which was an impressive 69 2  in Europe  Other major players like Hilton Worldwide  Choice Hotels International  NYSE CHH  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  are also targeting the European market Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel companies are diligently working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to strengthen their positions amid tough competition  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the large mass market segment  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  hotels will need to increasingly differentiate themselves  Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and the ability to innovate will be a key driver of success  Therefore  many leading hoteliers like Starwood Hotels  Marriott International  Belmond Ltd   BEL   Hyatt Hotels and Marcus Corporation  NYSE MCS  are firing on all engines to make their brands more relevant in today s environment Building Loyalty through Social Media and the Smartphone Technology  Digital innovation and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in the hotel industry  Social media can enhance a brand s prospect by connecting directly with guests  especially the millennials  and can in turn lead to increased loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP  are increasingly playing an important role in helping travelers select a hotel  Moreover  a higher number of hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage their bookings  interactive maps GPS as well as reward programs  Being tech savvy is no longer an option but a necessity for the hotel industry  Many companies are setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences   and deliver a differentiated experience   which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more  Loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience  Currently  Marriot Vacations Worldwide  NYSE VAC  and Intercontinental Hotels Group  LONDON IHG  Intercontinental Hotels Group  LONDON IHG  sport a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Despite being Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  we are optimistic about Starwood  Hyatt Hotels  Marriott  Hilton Worldwide  and Choice Hotels  given the momentum in their underlying businesses and based on the optimistic outlook for 2015 Bottom Line We firmly believe that the dark days have passed for lodging sector which is now on a path to recovery  This makes it a worthy investment proposition for 2015 provided the economic recovery continues and the industry s the low supply high demand scenario stays  Although risks have continued to ease out  near term risks related to a slowdown in the emerging markets might remain an overhang  As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the hotel industry for the long haul  But what about investing in the space right now  Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now ",2015-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-hotel-industry-in-a-honeymoon-period-245680,245680

Leading Asian markets fell again with the Shanghai Composite Index closing with a 7 6  loss and the Nikkei 225 down 4 0   while other key Asian markets closed with milder losses and Hong Kong ended up in positive territory  European markets were broadly higher  led by the first rise in the FTSE 100 in 11 sessions  the FTSE closed up over 3   the Euro Stoxx 50 closed up 4 7 percent 
 has dropped 22  in the past 4 sessions  Today  their central bank responded by cutting interest rates for one year lending by 25 basis points to 4 6   while the one year deposit rate will fall a quarter of a percentage point to 1 75 percent  The required reserve ratio will be lowered by 50 basis points for all banks to cover funding gaps  China s surprise yuan devaluation on Aug  11 led to a tightening in liquidity as the PBOC subsequently bought its currency to stabilize the exchange rate and curb capital outflows 
Roughly  4 5 trillion has evaporated from the Chinese markets since the middle of June   real  tangible wealth that no longer exists  Equities on mainland Chinese exchanges still trade at a median reported earnings multiple of 60  times  The yuan may face more downside pressure as a result of the latest monetary easing  making it harder to keep depreciation in check  The US dollar rallied for the first time in 5 days 
Against that backdrop this morning  stocks on Wall Street rallied  The Dow Industrial Average gained over 441 points this morning  and for a fleeting moment it looked like the carnage of the past week was but a blip on the screen  It turned out to be a classic dead cat bounce  The Dow lost 646 points from the intraday high to the close  the biggest reversal to the downside since October 29  2008 
The Standard   Poor s 500 stock index closed down 1 4 percent  to 1 867  after earlier rising almost 3 percent from Monday s close  The S P 500 closed down 12 5 percent from its May high  the Dow ended down 14 6 percent from its May high  Not as bad as yesterday  but still plenty ugly  And the final hour of trading was just nasty  panicky stuff  about a 500 point loss on the Dow in one hour 
So it begs the question  what spooked the markets in the final hour  There are many catalysts in play in the market s turn  from fears about China to corporate earnings and commodity prices  toss in concerns about emerging market credit  But at the core  much of this plunge is about a loss of faith in cheap money stimulus  In China  the concern is that the people s Bank of China isn t responding with enough force  or that they have responded with too much force and it is backfiring  take your pick 
In the US  the concern is that the recovery should be stronger by now  and there is the threat of the Fed hiking interest rates at the mid September FOMC meeting  It all highlights just how addicted the markets are to cheap money stimulus from central banks  and how that addiction has distorted valuations 
So  for the moment we don t know what spooked the markets in the final hour of trade  Maybe it was just an algorithm that triggered  Maybe we put too much faith in a shoddy Chinese market that wasn t built to last and now looks like nothing more than a shiny knock off of western markets  Maybe too many people grew weary of the pep talks from financial advisers repeating the mantra  don t worry  you re in it for the long haul  it just dredges up old ghosts 
If the Financial Crisis of 2008 2009 taught us anything  it was a lesson in the fragility of the financial and capital markets and the stages of denial as market developments unfold  And just because stocks drop in price it doesn t mean they are cheap or on sale or great values  Maybe there were some big hedge funds that started forced liquidations when things turned south  Maybe traders remembered that the Fed could still hike rates next month  even in the maw of a market correction  I m still not sure why the Fed seems inclined to a rate hike but they seem to like the idea 
The economic news was decent enough  New U S  single family home sales rose a bit less than expected in July  Sales increased 5 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 507 000 units  The stock of new houses for sale increased 1 9 percent to 218 000 last month  the highest level since March 2010  Still  supply remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom  The median price of a new home rose 2 percent from a year ago to  285 900 
Home prices continued to rise in June  The S P Case Shiller 20 city composite index rose 5 percent year over year in June  Home prices in Phoenix posted a 4 1  gain year over year 
Consumer confidence rebounded in August  The Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes jumped to 101 5  up from a reading of 91 0 in July  In the report  Lynn Franco at the Conference Board said   Consumers  assessment of current conditions was considerably more upbeat  primarily due to a more favorable appraisal of the labor market   The uncertainty expressed last month about the short term outlook has dissipated and consumers are once again feeling optimistic about the near future  Income expectations  however  were little improved  
 said its preliminary or  flash  reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector slipped to 55 2 in August from the final 55 7 reading in July  The U S  services sector expanded at a slower pace in August than July as new business growth softened 
The Congressional Budget Office says the US budget deficit is likely to fall by  60 billion in 2015 due to strong revenue gains  The CBO said it now estimates a  426 billion deficit for fiscal year 2015  down from its  486 billion forecast made in March  It also forecast a fiscal 2016 deficit of  414 billion  a reduction of  41 billion  The CBO says the government may be able to pay its bills without a debt limit hike through early December 
Oil prices managed a mild rally but couldn t close above  40 a barrel  API reported a huge 7 3 million barrel drawdown in oil inventories this week  against expectations of a build  and sparked a headline driven jerk higher in crude prices 
Oil prices dropping below  40 dollar a barrel sounds like a beautiful thing  It means cheap gas for your SUV and lower energy bills  At  2 60 a gallon  gas is now about a dollar below where it was last year at this time  And it could continue to fall  Eleven states now have gas prices under  2  When President Obama predicted in his State of the Union Address in January that  the typical family this year should save  750 at the pump   he was probably right  Multiply that by the nation s 115 million households and you get a total savings of over  86 billion  That s huge 
Lower gas prices help poor people in particular  households with incomes of less than  50 000 spent 21  of their income on energy in 2012  while households earning more than  50 000 spent 9   Additionally  Americans who live in chillier regions like New England and the Midwest could save another  750 or so on energy bills  The bad news is largely restricted to the Dakotas  Texas  Oklahoma  and Alaska  And when oil prices are low  we tend to use more gas  we loosen up on conservation  demand increases and that  of course  leads to higher prices  not all at once  but slowly  over time

110465,331980,WYND,Wyndham Destinations pulls Florida voucher donations over anti gay school policies,news,Wyndham Destinations became the third major company in three days to announce it will stop donating millions of dollars to Florida s private school voucher program after a newspaper investigation found that some of the program s beneficiaries discriminate against LGBTQ students Wyndham said that it told the organization last year that it would  halt funding if concerns about the voucher program were not addressed   As we have not seen any further action to address our concerns  we are today discontinuing our support and funding for Step Up For Students and hope that the organization will quickly work with the Florida Legislature to immediately end any discriminatory practices existing within the voucher program   the company told NBC News and CNBC on Thursday afternoon More from NBC News Wells Fargo pulls Florida voucher donations over anti gay school policiesLawmaker compares trans health care for minors to Nazi experiments  then backtracksSuit filed against Christian school that expelled girl after rainbow birthday photoThe timeshare company also said it would re evaluate its support if the concerns are addressed  adding   we remain in agreement with the value in providing low income families with the opportunity to choose the best education for their children  The Orlando based hotel company s announcement comes just two days after a similar announcement by Cincinnati based Fifth Third Bank and one day after an announcement from San Francisco based Wells Fargo  We have reviewed this matter carefully and have decided to no longer support Step Up for Students   Wells Fargo said of the voucher program  noting the bank s employees  highly value diversity and inclusion  and we oppose discrimination of any kind  Waste Management said in a statement to NBC News that it would be looking into the issue but said any discrimination is unacceptable  Waste Management is committed to Inclusion and Diversity and believes that discrimination of any kind is simply unacceptable  We are deeply concerned about the allegations and are investigating this issue before we make further funding decisions   Waste Management spokesperson Dawn McCormick said in an emailed statement The decisions by the three companies   which had donated to the voucher program in exchange for write offs on their state tax bills   come within a week of the Orlando Sentinel investigation that found that 156 private Christian schools with anti gay views educated more than 20 000 students across the state with tuition paid for by Florida tax dollars  Florida s scholarship programs  often referred to as school vouchers  sent more than  129 million to these religious institutions   the Sentinel reported Jan  23   That means at least 14 percent of Florida s nearly 147 000 scholarship students last year attended private schools where homosexuality was condemned or  at a minimum  unwelcome  The Sentinel investigation found that 83 of the 156 schools with anti gay views do not permit LGBTQ students to attend and that some of the schools prohibit students whose parents are gay  For example  Trinity Christian Academy  located in the northeastern corner of the state  received nearly  4 million in school vouchers last year despite having a policy that states  homosexuality  is  in opposition  to the school s beliefs and a homosexual student  would be required to withdraw   according to the Sentinel s findings However  when asked whether Step Up for Children  the nonprofit that administers the majority of Florida s school vouchers  would reevaluate which schools it works with following the Orlando Sentinel s findings  a spokesperson told NBC News that neither the organization nor the Florida Department of Education is  aware of any systemic discrimination against scholarship students  including LGBTQ students   We have no evidence of students being denied enrollment or expelled from private schools due to their sexual orientation or gender identity   Step Up for Students  public affairs manager  Patrick Gibbons  told NBC News   It s also important to note that among the students being helped by the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship are LGBTQ students  An email seeking comment from the state Education Department did not get a response Last July  before the Sentinel s investigation  a columnist for the paper wrote about the voucher program  Following the column s publication  at least one company  Rosen Hotels   Resorts  an Orlando based hospitality chain  stopped donating to the program The column also led state Sen  Darryl Rouson to file a bill last year that would prohibit private schools that deny enrollment to students based on  race  ethnicity  national origin  gender  disability  religion  sexual orientation  or gender identity  from benefiting from the program Rouson s bill  which was officially introduced this month  has not yet been considered by the Legislature ,2020-01-30,CNBC,https://invst.ly/pp5n2,2072449
