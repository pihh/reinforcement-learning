198865,420381,MO,Why Altria Stock Dropped Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Altria Group  NYSE MO  were down 6  as of 2 15 p m  EST Thursday  after the tobacco giant issued disappointing quarterly results 
So what
More specifically  Altria s fourth quarter 2019 revenue increased 0 3  to  4 802 billion  after accounting for excise taxes   translating to a 7 4  increase in adjusted earnings to  1 02 per share  Analysts  on average  were expecting roughly the same per share earnings  but on higher revenue of  4 88 billion 
Altria also recorded a staggering  4 1 billion noncash pre tax impairment charge related to its investment in JUUL during the quarter    a consequence of the growing number of legal cases against the e cigarette maker 

Nonetheless  Altria CEO Howard Willard insisted that the company s  core tobacco businesses delivered outstanding performance in 2019   noting that the company not only beat its  575 million target for reducing costs this year  but also raised its dividend for the 54th time in the past five decades 
Now what
 Despite the unexpected challenges related to our investment in JUUL  which led to impairment charges and reported losses  we made significant progress advancing and building our noncombustible business platform with the launch of IQOS and completion of the on  transaction   Willard added   We enter 2020 with continued focus on harm reduction  
For the full year of 2020  Altria expects adjusted earnings per share of  4 39 to  4 51  up 4  to 7  from 2019 and roughly in line with most investors  expectations 
Looking further ahead  however  Altria also lowered its targets for compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share from 2020 through 2022 to be in the range of 4  to 7   down from 5  to 8  previously   due to its expectation for no equity earnings from JUUL in that period 
Given that tempered outlook and Altria s relative underperformance to end 2019  it s no surprise to see shares falling hard today as investors absorb the news ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp3mh,2072204

website at altria com With that  I ll turn the call over to Howard Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mac  And good morning  everyone  2019 was a dynamic year for the tobacco category  For Altria  it was a year characterized by two distinct stories  the outstanding performance of Altria s core tobacco businesses and significant progress advancing our non combustible business platform  alongside disappointing performance from our Juul investment Across our businesses  our employees accomplished more with less and responsibly delivered outstanding results  Despite unexpected challenges with our investment in Juul  which led to impairment charges and reported losses  we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5 8  and continued to reward our shareholders with growing cash dividends  In 2019  we paid  6 billion in dividends to shareholders and increased the dividend for the 54th time in 50 years Our core tobacco businesses delivered strong financial performance  with each of the smokeable and smokeless product segments delivering high single digit adjusted operating company s income growth  significantly expanding their adjusted operating company s income margins and maintaining strength on their leading premium brands  In fact  if you look at the performance of our smokeable and smokeless product segments on a combined basis over the past five years  2019 was a high watermark for combined adjusted OCI and margin expansion In addition  we exceeded our  575 million cost reduction target  made significant progress advancing and building our non combustible business platform  with the launch of iQOS in two lead markets and the completion of the on  transaction  And we successfully advocated for moving the legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21 to address social access concerns among youth Turning to Juul  we are disappointed in the performance of our Juul investment in 2019  And we reported a second impairment of the Juul investment  which Billy will discuss in more detail shortly It s a critical time for the e vapor category and we believe manufacturers must take responsible steps in the short term to protect the long term opportunity that the category presents for adult smokers looking for alternatives  We believe that the e vapor category in its current form needs a reset and we believe the most important next steps to create a sustainable path forward are FDA s review and ultimate decisions on PMTA filings and driving down youth usage of e vapor This morning  we announced that we ve reached an agreement with Juul to revise some of the terms governing our investment  We ve agreed with Juul to continue providing regulatory affairs services  including supporting Juul s efforts to prepare and submit its PMTA filings by May 2020  And we will discontinue all other services by the end of March 2020  Our regulatory affairs team is working collaboratively with Juul on its PMTA effort and we re committed to helping Juul achieve this critical milestone We also agreed that Juul will create a new or independent board structure after we receive antitrust clearance from the FTC  We believe the new board structure will provide diverse perspectives and independent expertise to help Juul s management team successfully and responsibly navigate the very dynamic e vapor market going forward For Altria  we remain committed to preventing kids and non tobacco users from using tobacco products  According to 2019 Monitoring the Future  underage use of cigarettes is at a historic low at 3 7   down more than 85  from its 1997 peak  Although this is significant progress  we re troubled by the alarming rise in youth e vapor use This is why  in early 2019  we launched a national campaign to raise the minimum tobacco purchase age to 21 and worked persistently with state and federal lawmakers to support this legislation  In December  Congress enacted landmark federal legislation moving the legal age to purchase all tobacco products to 21  We have much more work ahead of us in reversing the youth e vapor trends and our efforts will not stop at tobacco 21 We must continue to advance harm reduction  There are approximately 40 million adult smokers in the US today with more than half interested in alternative products  While Juul forges its way in an ever changing e vapor category  we remain highly focused on our portfolio approach with alternative products like iQOS and on  We want our organization  including our sales force  to most effectively and responsibly advance the non combustible portfolio options we re building and we re moving forward on these opportunities responsibly and with increased resources With iQOS  we re encouraged by early interest from adult smokers and excitement from the trade  Heat sticks are now distributed across more than 500 retail stores in Atlanta and Richmond combined  Both launch markets include an innovative retail ecosystem that focuses on the consumer journey of awareness  engagement  trial  purchase and conversion We now have more than 100 trained iQOS professionals to provide guided trials  We continue to advance our commercialization plans and are gathering insights from our lead markets to inform them going forward Philip Morris International s MRTP application for iQOS remains pending with the FDA and we remain optimistic about its authorization  Additionally  PMI plans to submit a supplemental PMTA in the coming months for iQOS 3  The device offers a more premium and modern design and a rapid charged battery compared to the currently authorized 2 4 device  We plan to capitalize on our first mover advantage  while considering the opportunities presented by an FDA authorized reduced risk claim for iQOS 2 4 and the launch of a more modern device In oral nicotine pouches  we re advancing our plans quickly in this rapidly growing category  focusing on regulatory  manufacturing and distribution efforts  First  our Helix subsidiary expects to submit its PMTAs for on  by the May 2020 deadline Second  our best engineers are building manufacturing capability for on  at our Richmond manufacturing center and we expect to begin manufacturing there this quarter  We are targeting annualized manufacturing capacity of 50 million cans by mid year and 75 million cans by the end of 2020  on  can be purchased on its premium branded website through a robust age verification platform and is now sold nationally in 15 000 stores  including the Circle K  Sheetz and Murphy USA  representing three of the top five retail chain accounts for smokeless volume The on  brand team will use our adult tobacco consumer database to communicate responsibly with adult tobacco consumers about on  and its broad portfolio  In addition  the on  team plans to enhance the packaging to build brand equity and increase the visibility of the broad range of nicotine strengths and flavors to address the varying preferences of adult smokers and dippers As e vapor goes through a period of transition  we believe it s an opportune time to further invest in our plans in heated tobacco and oral nicotine  The strength of our core tobacco businesses provides us with the financial flexibility to make these investments as we capitalize on our first mover advantage in heated tobacco and on  s compelling proposition and broad portfolio We entered 2020 with continued focus on harm reduction and preparing for a future where adult tobacco consumers overwhelmingly prefer non combustible products over combustible products  We look forward to sharing more at CAGNY Let s turn to our financial outlook  For our Juul investment  we now expect HSR resolution in the first half of 2020  Upon antitrust clearance  we expect to account for our equity investment in Juul using the fair value option  Under this option  Altria s income statement will include any cash dividends received from the investment and quarterly changes in the fair value of the investment  Quarterly changes in the fair value of the investment will be treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted diluted EPS We don t currently expect to receive equity earnings contributions from Juul over the next three years  Therefore  we ve lowered our 2020 through 2022 compounded annual adjusted diluted EPS earnings growth objective to 4  to 7  from our previously announced objective of 5  to 8  For our 2020 guidance  we expect to deliver full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of  4 39 to  4 51  This range represents a growth rate of 4  to 7  from a 2019 adjusted diluted EPS base of  4 22  The 2020 guidance includes increased investments in our non combustible platform and one extra shipping day in the first quarter  We ll remind you that  in 2019  the benefits from our annualized cost reduction program were uneven and ramped up as the year progressed I ll now turn it over to Billy to provide more detail on our 2019 performance Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Howard  And good morning  everyone  We expect the tobacco category to remain dynamic with continued evolution in adult tobacco consumer preferences and tobacco regulation  We believe we re well positioned to deliver steady performance in this environment and that our enhanced business platform allows us to continue to deliver strong financial results and generate significant cash return to shareholders  commercialize non combustible tobacco products to provide satisfying alternatives for adult tobacco consumers  and participate in the adjacent and emerging cannabis category through our investment in Cronos As Howard mentioned earlier  in 2019  our core tobacco segments were resilient and delivered excellent performance against their stated objectives In the smokeable products segment  the segment grew adjusted OCI by 8 6  and expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 3 9 percentage points to 54 5   Higher pricing  significant cost savings and more efficient promotional spending more than offset lower cigarette volume to drive strong income growth for the year The smokeable products segment s price realization was up 8 4  for the year  More efficient promotional spending enabled through data analytics contributed to the segment s strong net pricing Marlboro retail share remained stable at 43 1   down 10  versus prior year  Product expansions with innovative resale packaging and other brand equity investments continue to support Marlboro s performance  The Marlboro Rewards equity program launched nationally a year ago continues to exceed our expectations  with over 2 6 million adult smokers enrolled and 200 million pack codes entered since its launch  Mobile coupons are driving repeat purchases and remain the number one redeemed item At the industry level  we estimate that US cigarette volumes declined by 4 5  in the fourth quarter and by 5 5  for the full year when adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors  We continue to believe that accelerated movement of adult smokers to other categories  primarily e vapor  and increased exclusive e vapor category usage drove the incremental year over year decline For cigarette price elasticity  we ll remind investors that this component of the decline rate is based on retail price changes that include excise taxes  manufacturer pricing and trade margin changes  For the full year 2019  cigarette industry prices at retail increased by approximately 4   When this is multiplied by the elasticity coefficient of negative 0 3  the result is a volume impact of 1 2  for the year Given the recent regulatory and legislative developments in e vapor and the national move to 21 as the legal age to purchase all tobacco products  we expect cigarette industry volume trends to remain dynamic Taking these factors into account  we project full year 2020 adjusted industry cigarette volumes to decline 4  to 6   However  due to our expectations for continued volatility across tobacco categories  we re no longer providing a multi year forecast for US cigarette industry volume declines In discount  we estimate that the total discount category share was up 40  for the full year  but remained in line with historical share levels at 24 2   While we have ceded some share in branded discount  PM USA continues to be pleased with L M s performance and its increased profitability over time In cigars  JMC had a great year  with 3 1  volume growth exceeding the machine made large cigar category  We re pleased with the continued strength of Black   Mild and the profitable tipped cigar segment and the cigars business  contribution to smokeable segment adjusted OCI growth Our smokeless product segment performed well in 2019  delivering more than  1 6 billion in adjusted OCI and maintaining strength behind Copenhagen  The smokeless product segment s adjusted OCI increased by 9 7  and adjusted OCI margins expanded by 3 percentage points to 71 7  as higher pricing  more efficient promotional spending and lower costs more than offset lower volume Copenhagen continued to lead the category and grew its share by 30  for the year to 34 8   When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences  adjusted smokeless volumes declined by an estimated 3  in 2019 In the last six months  total smokeless industry volume decreased by an estimated 1   We continue to believe that adult dipper interest and the oral nicotine pouch and e vapor categories impacted smokeless volumes Moving to e vapor  the e vapor category experienced rapid growth through the first nine months  growing volume approximately 35   The category s growth was driven almost entirely by Juul  Late in the third quarter  news of vapor related illnesses and deaths and the release of government survey data showing a significant rise in youth e vapor use drove legislative and regulatory action  Several states moved to ban flavored or all e vapor products  In the fourth quarter  the e vapor category declined nearly 8  sequentially and growth slowed to 3  year over year  Also  in the fourth quarter  we estimate Juul s share of the market declined sequentially to 44  from 48  In preparing our quarterly and year end financials  we performed a valuation analysis of our investment in Juul  As a result of this analysis  we ve recorded an additional  4 1 billion impairment to our Juul investment  primarily driven by the increased number of legal cases pending against Juul and the expectation that the number of legal cases against Juul will continue to increase Since our last quarterly earnings announcement on October 31  2019  the number of cases pending against Juul has increased by more than 80  For a brief review  in the third quarter  we adjusted expected cash flows from Juul to reflect slower future e vapor category growth due to likely regulatory action in the US and various e vapor bans in the US and international  In the fourth quarter  as a result of the legal environment we just described  we increased the discount rate to reflect greater uncertainty around Juul s future cash flows The latest impairment brings the current value of our investment to  4 2 billion dollars  As we said earlier  we re disappointed in the performance of the past year and hope Juul can move forward more constructively Turning to our strategic cannabis investment  Cronos  They are executing against a strategy of building differentiated brands and disruptive intellectual property  Last year  Cronos entered the rapidly growing US CBD market through its acquisition of Redwood Holdings  which manufactures and distributes the Lord Jones luxury brand Cronos has been preparing for Canada s legalization of derivative products including vaporizers  Cronos also made significant progress with talent acquisition  hiring and filling critical business roles We believe the US cannabis market  if reasonably regulated and legalized at the federal level  presents a tremendous opportunity  And we re pleased with Cronos  progress in building its key capabilities and business platform In alcohol  the results in our wine segment reflect ongoing challenges in Ste  Michelle s business  which they continue to work to address  Adjusted OCI for the year was  73 million  down nearly 30   driven primarily by higher cost and promotional investments  Ste  Michelle continues to invest in innovative packaging  digital marketing and brand optimization  For example  14 Hands is now the number one selling premium canned wine in 7 11 stores In beer  ABI delivered  875 million in adjusted equity earnings  representing an increase of 8 7  for the year  ABI also contributed nearly  400 million in cash dividends in 2019 Turning to capital allocation  we repurchased  500 million in shares in the fourth quarter  We have  500 million remaining under our previously announced  1 billion share buyback program and expect to complete the program by the end of this year And last August  we increased our dividend for the 54th time in the 50 years  Our current annualized dividend rate of  3 36 per share represents a dividend yield of 6 8  as of January 27  2020 That wraps up our results  Howard and I will be happy to take your questions  While the calls are being compiled  I ll remind you that today s earnings release and our non GAAP reconciliations are available on altria com  We ve also posted our usual quarterly metrics  which include pricing  inventory and other housekeeping items With that  I ll open up the question and answer period  Randy  do we have any questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel  One moment please Christopher Growe    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystI just wanted to ask a question  if I could  first  on    just looking at volume  particularly in the cigarette category  You had a number of    there seemed to be a number of puts and takes to volume in 2020 as we look ahead  I guess I just want to understand  you had a little stronger performance for the category in the fourth quarter  As we look ahead  you have tobacco 21  which could be a drag on volume  I guess I m curious about the cross category movement  It seems like we re seeing a pretty marked deceleration in e cigarettes  which has been a big drag there  So  maybe tobacco 21 and how you expect the e cigarette category to perform in 2020  And then  just to understand how that s going to help affect the volume for cigarettes in 2020 Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think when you look at cigarette volume declines  our range is 4  to 6   With regard to tobacco 21  in the first half of last year  we estimated about 2  of cigarette industry volume with legal age to 20  And so  certainly  that s going to be an impact this year going forward  But I would say that you already had a certain number of states that were already at a legal age to purchase of 21 before we made that measurement  And some of that got factored in as more than 50  of the US volume was covered by 21 by mid year  So  some of that decline is in the base of the decline rate I think with regard to e vapor  it s hard to precisely predict what s going to happen to that category  But if you just turn to the fourth quarter of this year  its year over year growth rate was only 3   And I think that we really expect that we re going to see a continued slowdown or even maybe a decline in the e vapor category over the next couple of years  And I think that s going to result in less pressure on the cigarette category The other products that potentially could impact the cigarette category  though  of course  our iQOS and heat not burn and the tobacco derived nicotine pouch business Christopher Growe    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystOkay  thank you for that  I had just one other follow up question  which is in relation to the cost savings you achieved in 2019  You noted that you had about a  600 million annualized rate you exited the year  Just to be clear  that puts you around  150 million in the fourth quarter  And is there any way to discuss what you have left in 2020 coming through from the actions you undertook in 2019 Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Chris  You re right  We were ramping up as we went through the year 2019  The biggest annualization will come from the headcount reduction related dollars because remember that most of the headcount exited toward the end of the first quarter  So  that will be the biggest part of the annualization Christopher Growe    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystAnd are you able to say  Billy  how much is left in terms of savings you expect in 2020 Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I probably won t go into that level of detail  but I think the  600 million is a good number from an annualized run rate OperatorYour next question comes from line of Vivien Azer of Cowen Vivien Azer    Cowen and Company    AnalystSo  I wanted to just touch base on some of your market share aspirations  given how dynamic the cigarette industry volume backdrop has proven to be  So  Howard  as you think about possibly a worse outlook relative to what you guys used to think  it s not a 3 to 4 anymore  does that change how you think about holding or modestly growing your cigarette market share  Thanks Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI have to say that we were pleased with our performance last year  We had stability on Marlboro  We had a modest step down in our share on L M  but it s at a much higher level of profitability and we had strong profit growth from the cigarette category  So  we believe that the performance we had last year was quite strong and quite acceptable Vivien Azer    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  Thank you  And just to follow up on Juul  can you comment at all about what your expectations are now for revenue mix over the next few years for Juul  domestic versus internationally Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Vivien  From a standpoint of    you know that Juul has announced    we know there s a reset that s taken place in the US and they ve had some announcements of some resets that they are in the process of making internationally  We certainly incorporated both into the valuation analysis  But I m going to be hesitant to go into the level of detail of the split up between both international and the US until we see the continuation of their plans roll out OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets Nik Modi    RBC Capital Markets  LLC    AnalystHoward  can you maybe talk about this ceasing of helping Juul with other areas outside of regulatory  Is that just in anticipation of FTC review  Can you just provide any context around that  I am assuming that means no coupons and some of the shelf spacing that you ve previously discussed And then  just thinking about 2020  your overall thoughts and just areas that we should be watching out for potential excise tax increases  I haven t reviewed some of the data out there  but maybe you could just give us any areas that you guys are looking at in terms of big tax hikes  Thanks Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  With regard to the change in the services that we re providing to Juul  it s not related to the FTC review  We ve agreed to continue to provide them with regulatory affairs services where the two teams are working together  I think  quite effectively  And I think that s one of their most important priorities  to file a complete and compelling application in May of 2020 this year As you may recall  last year  there were a number of services that we offered them  Some of them  they turned down and built their own infrastructure  And then  in other places  they built their own infrastructure  but on an ad hoc basis utilized some of our services  such as the sales force  What we found was that having both Juul personnel and Altria personnel that were sometimes involved in executing for Juul at retail that it created confusion and that it wasn t really an effective way to get the most out of the Altria sales organization  So  we ultimately agreed with Juul that they d continue to provide a number of the services exclusively  and that we pull back  And I think that gives us the opportunity to really invest in our sales and distribution organization and having them focus on our two core tobacco segments as well as the expansion of iQOS and on   And we know the kind of impact they can have when they are the sole supporter of our sales and distribution effort  and we re pleased to have some of that capacity back for our other businesses OperatorYour next question comes from line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley Pamela Kaufman    Morgan Stanley   Co  LLC    AnalystSo  Billy touched on pricing elasticity in his comments  which do not appeared to have changed  Are you surprised that there have not been changes to pricing elasticity in the cigarette category  given the availability of lower priced alternatives  And do you see any risk to your ability to continue to increase your realized at a high single digit rate Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Pamela  When we look at price elasticity    and you recall  we ve had significant price increases  if you go back in history  whether it was related to MSA or excise taxes in a given state  And the price elasticity has held at that negative 0 3 coefficient From a standpoint of alternative products  when we talk to consumers  pricing doesn t really factor into their top reasons for switching out  There are other reasons mentioned  So  it is not surprising that that hasn t changed I m going to be a little bit reluctant to talk about the future pricing  I will note that pricing is part of our algorithm  but there are also puts and takes across the P L and we ll assess that as we move forward Pamela Kaufman    Morgan Stanley   Co  LLC    AnalystOkay  thanks  And I also wanted to ask about your outlook for Juul s PMTA submission  Is there any evidence of an improvement in Juul s usage trends based on recent surveys and would you expect to see a meaningful improvement in Juul s performance in the next youth tobacco survey Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I don t know that there has been government data released since about the second quarter of last year  But I do expect  before the filing deadline of May  there is going to be    that second quarter survey will be completed  And while it won t be available publicly for a bit of time  it will certainly be available publicly before  I would expect  the FDA to make any decisions on the PMTAs that they accept as filed I think that there is reason to be optimistic that there is going to be an improvement or a reduction in youth usage of e vapor products because of  I think  two very significant developments  The first one is that we now have a minimum age of purchase of 21 nationwide  And I think that will be in effect for a full three months before that survey starts to measure youth usage And then  secondly  the FDA has now provided nationwide guidance that s in effect that is going to restrict  certainly for pod based e vapor products  the availability of flavors to tobacco and menthol  I think that should have a positive impact on driving down youth usage rates and  certainly  I would expect that the Juul usage would decline as well I think how fast it goes down  I think we re going to have to wait and see OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri Gupta with Barclays Priya Ohri Gupta    Barclays PLC    AnalystJust a quick follow up on that last question around how you expect sort of disposable products to potentially mitigate some of the benefits from e cigarette youth usage And then  secondly  you guys had a  1 billion bond that came due earlier this month  Just wanted to understand if we should expect you to refinance that or  given sort of your healthy cash flows  expect you to just have paid that down  Thank you Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I think you re referencing the fact that  when the FDA implemented their guidance restricting the availability of flavored products  they were quite clear that for pod based closed system products that they were going to enforce against any product in the market other than tobacco and menthol  And they were not as clear with regard to some of the other product formats But I think that they were also quite specific that any product they found that was contributing to youth usage of e vapor products  they were certainly going to going to enforce regardless of the product format  So  I think if you see youth usage switch to other product formats other than pod based products  I would expect the FDA to step in and enforce against those products as well I ll turn it over to Billy on your bond question Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  you re exactly right  With the strong generation of the cash from our core businesses  we d pay that with available cash OperatorYour next question comes from line of Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler Michael Lavery    Piper Sandler    AnalystOn the Juul equity income expectation  now that that would not have any contribution over the next three    three or four years  is that more related to the accounting treatment  recording cash dividends  Or does that reflect your expectations for what those earnings might look like Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Michael  When you look at the fair value option  you have two components that come through  You only record  if you will  equity income related to dividends  And then  you have  if you will  the change or adjustment to the fair value on a quarterly basis  And so  since that equity line would include only dividends  we don t have any expectations that we would receive dividends over the next three years  That s a helpful clarification  Thanks  And on the FTC review  obviously  you d said you thought it would be resolved in the first quarter and now it s pushed out to the first half  Can you just give some color there  Is that delay any cause for concern Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don t think it is a cause for concern  There is a significant amount of activity going on  And there were some scheduling delays that pushed it likely out of the first quarter  but I don t think it s driven anything more than that Michael Lavery    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  Just lastly  on the buybacks  you did the  500 million in the fourth quarter and now are guiding to  500 million for the full year  Is there any reason why that pace would change or should we expect maybe a little bit of upside against that  How should we think about the outlook from here Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Yeah  I think  Michael  as far as share repurchase  I m not going to speak to the pace  We really look at the market and make those decisions  We re in the current share repurchase program  and we ll assess what the pace is and whether we make any changes to that in the future OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi Adam Spielman    Citigroup    AnalystI have a couple of questions  Can I start with the tobacco 21  In the states where you ve seen that imposed for quite a while  can you say if there s been a difference in the volume run rate  I guess  That would be my first question on tobacco 21 Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks for the question  Adam  I think when you look at the individual states  they differ in the way that the impact of that has happened  And so  it s a bit early  I know you re referring to a couple of states that went much earlier  but it s tough to tease out  We ll certainly be able to see that now with the nationwide    on a federal level  the 21  So  we ll be able to provide better input to that as we move forward Adam Spielman    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  thank you  So  also related to that  I guess the tobacco 21 has two impacts  Firstly  you might have fewer people almost immediately because they just can t buy it  but also you might think that the run rate of volume declines might get worse because  I guess  you re recruiting fewer smokers potentially in the future  And I was just wondering whether    how you think about that second point  whether you think tobacco    not only does it have an impact this year in 2020  but whether there also is the ongoing volume decline in the US Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think as we think about the impact of tobacco 21  I don t know that we divide it up the way you looked at it  Clearly  there are legal age to 20 tobacco users that were legal to purchase the product before that are no longer legal and we hope that they fall out of the category and end up obeying the law  I think  secondly  we actually don t advertise to non tobacco users  but certainly tobacco 21 could cause people to delay their consideration of entering the tobacco category  And while that might have a future impact on category volumes  We don t do research on that Adam Spielman    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  thank you very much  And then  just if I can come back to the change of the agreements in Juul  And  obviously  you re now going to provide them with less services than you had previously agreed to provide  And I was just wondering if Juul has got anything in return for what looks like less value to them Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think as you looked at the agreement with Juul  I think that ultimately there were a number of changes to the agreement  I think we both felt like that was an agreement that provided value to both sides and that s ultimately why we agreed to it Adam Spielman    Citigroup    AnalystFine  And just one final question  I noticed that the growth of the deep discount category  the sort of non branded discount category  in terms of market share was slightly higher in 2019 than it was in previous years   Indecipherable  incrementally  Why do you think that was  And do you think we will continue to see that    that increased switching to non branded discount going forward Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think related to that    we had been talking about it being churn for most of the year and I think that s primarily what occurred in the year  You re right  in 2019  it stepped slightly outside of just churn  I think as we see the aging of adult smokers  they tend to skew a bit more into the discount category  but I think there s always present  in the consumer base  a group of consumers that are looking for  if you will  the cheaper or cheapest cigarette in the store  And as you ve seen us and others take profitability on branded discount  you re seeing that consumer move down to  if you will  the AOM and the the deep discount OperatorYour next question comes from line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies Owen Bennett    Jefferies    AnalystJust had a question around the non compete obligation  And if a scenario did happen where you re released from that  a few questions around that  Would it be right in assuming  therefore  that it would be MarkTen that you d try to get back on the market  And then also  are you in a good spot where you could get a PMTA in with MarkTen pretty quickly And then  finally  would you need to get a PMTA in first before you can get it on to the market  Or is MarkTen available  like  for instance  in some little part of the US  so it s not completely been removed off the shelf  so you could ramp that up again pretty quickly Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I wouldn t read too much into our renegotiation with Juul that in the future potentially gives us more flexibility to compete  And I don t think that we have a well defined plan  if we were to decide to execute that  Certainly  we had some e vapor products  although I would point out that they were not performing at a level that we found to be particularly satisfying  And certainly  any product that would be placed on the market would need to go through PMTA authorization  assuming that it was put on the market after May of 2020 OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays  Gaurav  your line is open Okay  Your next question comes the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank Securities Inc     AnalystI guess going back a little bit to the    just the cigarette category and market share dynamics  I guess  just an update if we could about your satisfaction with the Marlboro brand in terms of its standing versus    and just overall brand equity  Clearly  we saw some share loss this year  We ve discussed in the past  But is there anything that you see there that causes you any concern relative to what you discussed in the past that may need corrective action Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  we are very pleased with the Marlboro brand  We think that PM USA team has done a fantastic job and really presented us with stability around the brand  They ve had some excellent equity programs  I mentioned Marlboro Rewards earlier  I think that s really driving repeat purchases with those consumers that want to be engaged with Marlboro Yeah  We saw a    I wouldn t necessarily consider that a huge decline  I consider that stability  And if you look back  and we provided it over the  call it  the last seven to eight quarters  you ve seen very strong stability in the Marlboro brand itself Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank Securities Inc     AnalystOkay  great  And then  I guess  secondly  the decision to remove your long term cigarette volume outlook  does that simply reflect just a lack of visibility on your part or is the action more intended to maybe focus us on other metrics that you kind of see as more important as you work toward managing to optimize profit growth across the portfolio  I m just trying to understand  I guess  the motivation and impetus behind removing that number from your communication Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerSure  I think that we feel like it s    we re probably in a better position to forecast the one year trend than we are for the three year trend  And I think that if we re going to forecast  we d like to do it with a reasonable level of confidence about about falling within it  And we ve just found that  based on our past experience and based on the number of things that are impacting cigarette volumes going forward  that we thought we were better off not continuing to provide that OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS Robert Rampton    UBS    AnalystMy first question is  so it looks like Juul volumes were down 15  quarter on quarter  How much of that came from after Juul pulled mint pods  I m trying to think about the implications of the imminent cartridge ban for the rest of the market  Thank you Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  I really can t break down how much of that volume decline for Juul came after their November announcement of withdrawing mint and how much came before  But I think you are right that the primary driver of that volume decline was the impact of them removing mint from the market  And while that impacted Juul in the fourth quarter  I think there is likely to be a volume step down for the other companies that didn t proactively remove their flavored products and instead waited for FDA to force them to remove those products  and that  of course  will be an impact in the first quarter  Okay  thank you  So  my next question is  assuming e cigarette sales decline year on year for 2020 in total  looking at your estimate of a 2 point drag this year    for 2019  is the implication that that 2 point drag disappears or am I interpreting that incorrectly  Well  I think that it s a little bit hard to measure precisely  We ve given you our estimate of 4  to 6  volume decline for cigarettes  But I think that if you had an e vapor category that declined  I think that the    any stepped up decline of cigarettes related to e vapor would probably go away  The question would then be  what are the potential impacts of either heat not burn or other movement to other categories  And then  of course  you d have to factor in the impact of Tobacco 21 Robert Rampton    UBS    AnalystOkay  thank you  That s very helpful  And then  sorry  my final question on iQOS  Any color on how that s going on the spectrum of Germany to Japan  Are you happy to give any more color on where you think the US will fall  Thank you Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s still a bit early  And I know you re expecting us to say that  but I think what we are looking at is getting the learnings  We had learnings in Atlanta and we ve started some adjustments both in Atlanta and our subsequent launch in Richmond  We do have future plans and we ll be sharing much more at CAGNY OperatorWe will now take questions from the media  Your first question comes from line of Jennifer Maloney of Wall Street Journal Jennifer Maloney    The Wall Street Journal    AnalystHoward  my question is for you  You personally made the case for this big bet on Juul  You made the case to shareholders  to your own board members  And I wonder what your feelings are now in this moment  Are you feeling frustrated that Juul didn t act sooner to address regulators  concerns  Are you feeling regret for having invested in Juul in the first place Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI have to tell you  I m highly disappointed in the financial performance of the Juul investment  And I think that that is reflected in the most recent valuation  which is substantially below what we had expected  I think as you look at the drivers of that  there were a number of unexpected outcomes in the year  Probably the one that I think was hardest to have forecast was the appearance of the serious lung injury  Essentially  you had the CDC recommending to all e vapor consumers  both THC and nicotine consumers  that they stop vaping  And it took quite a bit of time to get clarification that the serious lung injury was primarily driven by THC black market products  So  I think it s a disappointing performance I would  however  note that Juul was the market share leader and the volume growth leader in 2019  And I think while there is going to be a reset in the category that I think is an appropriate reset to drive down youth usage  I do think that they are well positioned following the reset to have more success in the future Jennifer Maloney    The Wall Street Journal    AnalystThanks  And one more  if I may  This new revised agreement gives you an out on the non compete and it acknowledges that Juul might be taken off the market by federal law  So  do you see that as a higher possibility now than you did before Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don t think that our change in the agreement to have additional optionality of certain things happen in the future were necessarily driven by a change in our view of what might happen to Juul  But clearly  we decided that there is always a chance that something like that could happen and we thought having the option to elect under those circumstances to be able to go back into the market and compete  we thought that had value But I have to tell you right now  our primary focus Is on helping Juul file a compelling and complete PMTA with the FDA by the May 20 deadline OperatorYour next question is from the line of Tiffany Kary of Bloomberg Tiffany Kary    Bloomberg News    AnalystHoward  a question for you  How are you calculating the litigation risk from Juul  And are there steps you can take to isolate yourself  given the way the deal was structured in terms of the indemnification agreement  Or agreement not indemnifying Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Why don t I let Billy take that Billy Gifford    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  if you look at the way we assessed it is  it was really a change in the discount rate for the fourth quarter impairment  We really looked at assessing    we did not assess the merits of the cases  whether they would be successful or not against Juul  We really looked at assessing the risk of the uncertainty related to the litigation  You ll recall  if you go back even in our tobacco history when we were facing AG suits and similar suits  the market itself put a higher level of discount on our share price compared to the S P  Subsequent to that  that has gone from our share price  but that s what was reflected in the fourth quarter impairment As far as the structure of the agreement  I would remind you  we do assess the merits of the cases that we re named in  and we think they are meritless and we will be filing for a motion to dismiss Tiffany Kary    Bloomberg News    AnalystThank you  And one more thing  if I may  PMI has just made another deal with a Korean company  You re already moving on to iQOS 3  Would you ever sell in the US other sorts of products that your sister company Philip Morris is selling overseas Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe re always open minded  but I won t comment on that at this time OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays Gaurav Jain    Barclays PLC    AnalystI had a couple of questions  Number one was just on the cadence of volume through the year  So  Q4  19 industry volumes were minus 4 5  when Q4  18 comp was minus 5   And Q1  19 to Q2  19 comps are very easy when industry volumes were down 7   So  should we expect that volumes will be much better in the first half and tobacco 21 impacts in the second half and that s how volumes progress through the year Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I don t know that it s possible to predict each quarter s cigarette volume decline with that level of precision  I think we provided you with kind of our perspective on what the puts and takes might be  but I would hesitate to forecast on a quarter over quarter basis Gaurav Jain    Barclays PLC    AnalystSure  My second question is on on  that you mentioned you will be filing a PMTA  but would you also be thinking of filing an MRTP  And could you also remind us where you are with the Copenhagen MRTP as well Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Right now  our first priority is to file the PMTA by the May deadline  but you are right to point out that that is a product that I think has potential to receive an MRTP  And I think we ll turn to that task after we get the May filing completed  And you are also right that it s been about a year since the TPSAC hearing on Copenhagen  We thought that we had a good hearing with regard to Copenhagen as a potentially reduced risk product and we would expect to hear on Copenhagen anytime now OperatorThank you  I will now turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments Howard Willard    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  In summary  while the Juul investment and e vapor category remain challenging  our core tobacco businesses are strong and resilient  delivering significant cash and providing us with the flexibility to invest in our non combustible business platform  We continue to believe that Altria s enhanced business platform best positions us to succeed under various future category scenarios Lastly  and most importantly  I want to thank our employees for their accomplishments and relentless dedication over the past year  Because of them  I have even greater confidence in our ability to succeed into the future Thanks again

198867,420383,MO,Altria Swings to a Deep Loss in Q4,news,"Altria Group  NYSE MO  stock is taking it on the chin in late trading on Thursday  following a dispiriting earnings report 
The tobacco giant unveiled its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results  which showed that it booked revenues net of excise taxes of slightly over  4 80 billion in the former period  That was essentially unchanged from the Q4 2018 result  Much more dramatically  under GAAP standards Altria swung violently to a  1 8 billion   1 00 per share  loss on the bottom line from a nearly  1 3 billion profit in the year ago quarter 

The loss was due largely to a  4 1 billion impairment charge on the value of Altria s investment in vape maker JUUL Labs  Altria said that   t his impairment is primarily due to the increased number of legal cases pending against Juul and the expectation that the number of legal cases against Juul will continue to increase  
The vaping segment in general has been under pressure of late due to fatalities associated with the use of such products  and growing concern over their effects on user health  Altria holds a 35  stake in JUUL Labs  in an earnings call regarding the latest results  CEO Howard Willard said he was  highly disappointed in the financial performance of the Juul investment  
Removing the impairment charge  plus other one time items  from Altria s bottom line results in a non GAAP  adjusted  per share net profit of  1 02 for the quarter  That s broadly in line with analyst expectations  That top line figure came in below the average prognosticator projection of  4 88 billion 
For the entirety of fiscal 2020  Altria believes it will post adjusted EPS of  4 39 to  4 51  which would top the 2019 result by 4  to 7

198868,420384,MO,Altria feels the financial heat from Juul stake ,news,"Altria Group   NYSE MO  is showing signs of buyer s remorse when it comes to the 35 percent stake it bought in e cigarette company Juul 
Altria  the parent company of old school cigarette brands like Marlboro  said Thursday that it will stop providing services including logistics  distribution and access to retail shelf space to Juul 
A string of vaping related deaths  though none connected to Juul  coupled with a growing number of government bans on e cigarettes after a surge in teen vaping  has clouded what once was a very promising future for Juul and a new smoking category that was supposed to offset the decline in traditional cigarettes 
Altria is watching the value of its investment go up in smoke 
On Thursday  Altria announced a  4 billion write down on its Juul investment in the fourth quarter mainly due to the growing number of legal cases facing the e vaping company  that brings Altria s total write down to nearly  9 billion   It only paid  12 8 billion for the Juul stake back in December 2018   
With that in mind  Altria has now re worked the terms of the deal   taking a step back to only help Juul with regulatory affairs including the submission of products for FDA approval 
But Altria isn t optimistic about the future   on Thursday s earnings conference call  the CEO said he expected to see a continued slowdown or outright decline in the e vaping category and said there was always the chance Juul could get pulled off the market by federal law 
Juul s problems helped swing Altria from a fourth quarter profit to a loss of nearly  2 billion 
Shares of Altria were down in Thursday trade ",2020-01-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/altria-feels-the-financial-heat-from-juul-stake-2072831,2072831
198869,420385,MO,Altria s Profit Just Got Vaporized,news,"For a long time  Altria Group s  NYSE MO  biggest challenge was navigating the turbulent world of cigarette litigation and regulation  With consumer safety groups focusing on supporting the gradual but steady decline in adult smoking in the U S  over the past several decades  Altria thought that exploring and encouraging potential alternatives to traditional cigarettes might be a reasonable way to perpetuate its business  Instead  e cigarettes have come under fire as well 
Coming into Thursday s fourth quarter financial report  Altria investors had hoped that the recent controversy over e cigarettes wouldn t have too big an impact on its overall business  Altria s report included a massive impairment charge related to its investment in e cig giant JUUL Labs  causing the tobacco giant to post an overall loss and triggering a big strategic shift for Altria going forward 
Red ink for Altria
Altria s fourth quarter results reflected the ongoing pressures that the company has faced  Revenue net of excise tax inched higher by 0 3  to  4 80 billion  which came in slightly below the  4 88 billion that many of those following the stock had anticipated seeing  Altria posted a net loss of  1 81 billion  and even after adjusting to remove the big one time charges the tobacco giant suffered  adjusted earnings of  1 02 per share just matched the consensus forecast among investors 

The most stunning part of the report was the negative impact from Altria s investment in JUUL  The company took a massive  4 1 billion impairment charge against its investment  saying that a rising number of legal cases pending against the e cigarette company justified the increase  That brought the total impairments Altria s taken against its initial  12 8 billion investment in JUUL to  8 6 billion  or about two thirds of what Altria put into the company 
Elsewhere  Altria s key segments saw somewhat mixed performance  Revenue net of excise tax for the smokeable products segment fell 0 5  year over year on an 8 7  drop in cigarette shipment volumes  but adjusted operating company income climbed at a healthy 10  rate  Altria s market share in the segment fell to 49 5   down from 49 9  a year ago  The smokeless products division looked better  with a 6  rise in sales matching up well with a nearly 10  gain in adjusted operating company income  despite weaker shipment volumes  Altria s wine business saw slight revenue gains but suffered a drop on its bottom line due to higher costs 
What s ahead for Altria and JUUL 
CEO Howard Willard did his best to accentuate Altria s primary businesses   Despite the unexpected challenges related to our investment in JUUL   Willard said   we made significant progress advancing and building our noncombustible business platform   The CEO pointed to the launch of the IQOS heated tobacco system and its majority investment in the producer of on   an oral nicotine product  as potentially driving growth into 2020 
Yet behind that statement was a considerable shift in Altria s overall strategy  The tobacco giant modified its deal terms with JUUL  stepping back from many of the services that Altria offered to JUUL in its original investment  Altria also set the stage to get out of its noncompete agreement with JUUL  either if federal law bans e vapor product sales in the U S  or if Altria s carrying value for JUUL falls below 10  of the original  12 8 billion investment 
Altria s growth for 2020 will also fall short of investors  hopes  Adjusted earnings should come in between  4 39 and  4 51 per share  up 4  to 7  from 2019 s full year adjusted earnings of  4 22 per share  That s not very different from what analysts were expecting  but it still reflected the uncertainty in Altria s business right now 
Altria shares fell sharply following the announcement  Until lawmakers and the U S  Food and Drug Administration figure out exactly how they ll handle e cigarettes  there ll be a cloud over Altria    and over the heads of shareholders hoping for a rebound in its stock price ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppf9s,2072888
198870,420386,MO,Altria Wipes Another  4 1 Billion Off Its JUUL Investment,news,"Altria  NYSE MO  decided to write off another huge chunk of its investment in JUUL Labs after all 
Although I said it was a gimme that the tobacco giant would take more charges against its  12 8 billion bet this year because of the unrelenting campaign against the electronic cigarette manufacturer  I didn t think it would happen so soon  It had just written off  4 5 billion on JUUL a couple of months ago  but Altria revealed in its fourth quarter earnings report that it needed to eliminate another  4 1 billion of the investment s value 
It seems a sure thing this won t be the last one either 

An anchor on performance
Altria reported fourth quarter revenue net of excise taxes inched higher during the period  rising 0 3  from the same quarter a year ago  hitting  4 8 billion  Excluding the impairment charge to JUUL  adjusted earnings came in at  1 02 per share  a 7 4  increase over last year 
Yet the JUUL investment remains the elephant in the room at the moment and on a GAAP basis  Taking another massive writedown on the e cig maker caused Altria to swing to a  1 00 per share loss for the quarter  And even Altria seems resigned to the fact that there is more to come 
The tobacco company said that in the three months since it took the last impairment charge  the number of lawsuits against JUUL has skyrocketed 80   though Altria said it s not making any judgments on the outcome of these cases as anything can happen 
One of those possible outcomes  however  is that JUUL goes bust  The value of Altria s investment has been reduced to a third of where it started  If JUUL can t make the Food   Drug Administration s deadline for submitting its premarket tobacco product application  JUUL says it will   or if it can t successfully navigate through the regulatory approval process  the agency s former commissioner says he doesn t see how it can   it could very well mark the end of what was  and currently still is  the most popular e cig on the market 
Other smoke free opportunities
While Altria s earnings were dominated by JUUL  the cigarette maker did have other  mostly positive  developments to report 
Philip Morris International s  NYSE PM  IQOS heated tobacco device has expanded beyond the original Atlanta test market into Richmond  Virginia  and should be introduced elsewhere soon  It does seem  however  that Altria is slow walking the rollout 
The on  nicotine pouch business it bought from Burger Sohne is also available in 15 000 stores nationwide  and in house production of the cigarette alternative is slated to begin in the first quarter of 2020 
The new business has a lot of potential  but California is proposing to ban all flavored tobacco products and their derivatives  including nicotine  which would ensnare these tobacco free lozenges  If other states follow California s lead  Altria could run into the same sort of problems it has with JUUL 
Clouds on the horizon
There are additional headwinds Altria faces  The minimum age to buy tobacco products has been raised to 21 at the federal level  and while the cigarette company fell in line saying it supported the increase  it s going to affect cigarette sales  Altria already forecasts the industry will suffer another 4  to 6  decline this year 
It also still hasn t gotten antitrust clearance from the Justice Dept  for its investment in JUUL  over a year after having made it  Despite still expecting to receive it    or at least putting on a brave front that it will    Altria renegotiated the terms of its investment in the e cig maker 
It will now have a say in appointing two directors to JUUL s board and it will be released from its e cig non compete clause if JUUL doesn t get FDA premarket approval  More ominously  Altria says if the value of its investment in JUUL falls below 10  of the original amount  it will also be released from the clause 
That almost seems like a certainty  but don t expect Altria to reenter the e cig market  Its partnership with Philip Morris for the IQOS ought to give it sufficient exposure 
Finding a way through
Altria isn t quite as invested in a smoke free future as Philip Morris is  but its portfolio of non combustible cigarette alternatives is substantial and the tobacco giant still seems to be making progress  
The ill timed investment in JUUL continues wreaking havoc on its performance  and undoubtedly it will continue to do so until it finally washes its hands of the fiasco    or until the FDA does it for the company ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppit3,2073176
198871,420387,MO,Altria s Earnings  Bull Case Still Intact for This Dividend Growth Stock,news,"Altria  NYSE MO  reported fourth quarter earnings on Jan  30  and the market did not take the news well    Altria s shares fell by over 4   On the surface  the price decline seems warranted  as Altria missed its revenue forecast and took another impairment charge on its JUUL investment  It also revised its medium term adjusted earnings per share forecast lower and announced that it would no longer provide guidance on industry cigarette volumes  Not surprisingly  the earnings report did little to buoy investor confidence 

 Altria s earnings were mixed at best
Let s review the company s earnings results  Net revenue fell 1 8  to  6 0 billion  missing expectations  Adjusted earnings per share  EPS  rose 7 4  as pricing increases offset volume declines  The company s JUUL investment was written down by a further  4 2 billion  bringing the total writedown to close to 70  of the original acquisition price  Finally  Altria adjusted its medium term adjusted EPS forecast downwards from a range of 5 8  growth to 4 7   incorporating the litigation risks associated with JUUL 
However  does this change the investment thesis for Altria  A deeper analysis of the company s results would actually suggest no  Altria s long term appeal rests on its ability to raise cigarette prices at a rate faster than volume declines  thereby funding its growing dividend  At the same time  the company would grow its other businesses to compensate for the longer term decline in the cigarette market 
The longer term thesis remains in place
Altria s earnings would suggest that these factors are still intact  The company s cigarette volume fell by 6   but it raised its pricing by 8 5   which allowed profits to grow in the high single digits  This has been the pattern for years  and will likely continue for the foreseeable future  Morningstar estimates the U S  cigarette market is the fourth most affordable among OECD nation cigarette markets  and that Altria will likely generate excess returns for at least the next 20 years  It is this pricing ability that has enabled Altria to grow its annual adjusted earnings per share consecutively    with the exception of one year    since the start of the millennium 
And although Altria s JUUL s investment looks like an unmitigated disaster  problems in the e cigarette market have actually provided a tailwind for cigarettes  Morgan Stanley estimates that U S  cigarette volume declined 4 5  in the fourth quarter  compared to a pace of  5 5  in the first nine months of the year  They attribute this improvement to a slowdown in e cigarette sales  as health concerns shifted users to cigarettes 
Meanwhile  Altria continues to diversify away from cigarettes  The iQOS product has now been rolled out to 500 stores across Atlanta and Richmond  with the likelihood of further expansion into other test markets in 2020   Altria s non smokeable segments grew as a percentage of overall sales  with Smokeless products up 5 8  and wine up 2  in the fourth quarter  These efforts  combined with its stakes in cannabis producer Cronos and Anheuser Busch Inbev  should continue to move the company s exposure away from cigarettes   
Altria also pays a hefty dividend  at a yield close to 7   Having grown this for 50 consecutive years  there is no reason to expect any interruption to this streak in the foreseeable future  With the stock trading at its lowest valuation in ten years  investors are being given a rare opportunity to buy a dividend growth stock on the cheap ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prghn,2076846

198874,420390,MO,Juul Needs a  700 Million Loan as Altria Pulls Back,news,"A little over a year ago  tobacco giant Altria  NYSE MO  made a bet on an alternative to tobacco  investing  12 8 billion to secure a 35  stake in electronic cigarette maker Juul Labs  A little over a year later  Juul has blown through nearly all that cash  and needs to tap the debt markets for  700 million more   
Now  it s starting to look like Altria s investment was a costly mistake 

As reports of  lung disease  among e cigarette  vapers  mounted last year  and the CDC and FDA both seemed to turn against Juul  Altria was forced to take repeated charges for the declining value of its investment     4 5 billion in November  and then another  4 1 billion just last month  At last report  all of Juul was valued at just  12 billion    less money than Altria spent to acquire a third of the company 15 months ago 
And Altria is reluctant to keep throwing good money after bad  As The Wall Street Journal reports this morning  the tobacco giant has informed Juul that it will no longer assist with marketing and retail distribution expenses  Instead  what help Altria does give will be targeted at making sure Juul simply has a business  by helping Juul move its products into the review process at the FDA    which Juul must do by May if it intends to continue selling e cigarettes in the U S   
And yet  marketing and distribution still requires money  To cover those costs  Juul raised  785 million in convertible debt  bonds  convertible to stock at a certain price  in August    and another  700 million today  Unless the e cig market turns around in a hurry  Nielsen says Juul s sales fell 25  in the four weeks ended January 25   this may not be the last time Juul asks for a loan ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psksr,2079499

198888,420404,MO,It s Weed Week  Hang On As Cannabis Firms Report Earnings,opinion,"It s shaping up to be a pivotal week in the cannabis sector as several big names are set to unveil their latest earnings  beginning later today and continuing through Thursday  Given the cluster of financial data to be released  the impact on stock prices could reach beyond just the companies reporting and extend to the entire sector 

Among the companies reporting quarterly earnings between today and Nov  14 are Tilray  Cronos Group  Acreage Holdings  Canopy Growth  Aurora Cannabis and Medipharm Labs 

Here s what to expect 
Cronos Group

The Toronto based  Cronos  Group  NASDAQ CRON    TSX CRON   which has the smallest slice of the retail cannabis market  probably has the greatest potential to show growth when it reports its quarterly results before the open today  Its stock closed down just over 5  Monday  hitting US 8 08 on the NASDAQ and C 10 69 on the TSX Composite  The shares have lost just over a third of 1  in the last year  which is a lot better than most in the industry 
Cronos has another strong advantage in its back pocket compared with other companies in the sector   its  1 8 billion investment from  Altria Group   NYSE MO   the U S  cigarette maker  This has allowed it to finance its entry into the CBD market  
Tilray
For Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   the expectations are not as optimistic  It s third quarter report will be released after the closing bell today 

The company is struggling with dropping cannabis prices due to expanding inventory  which is making it difficult for it to digest its greater than expected  17 9 million before adjustments loss reported last quarter  largely due to ongoing expansion 

The British Columbia based grower has struggled to live up to its hype  created early  when its stock skyrocketed 40  in one day in September 2018  making headlines on both sides of the border  Since then  it has been marked by volatility that has created headline generating highs and lows  The stock has lost almost 80  in the past year  closing down 6 4  Monday at US 21 92  Expectations from analysts are not overly optimistic 

  Acreage  HoldingsAcreage Holdings  OTC ACRGF    CSE ACRGu  will be one to watch  Its third quarter earnings results  which will be released after the close today  will be discussed by company officials on Wednesday morning  

This New York based company is one of the largest multi state licensed cannabis growers and retailers and operates in 20 states  With a large footprint in the U S  markets where weed is legal  its performance will be an indication of its potential down the road as federal U S  legalization inches closer  Acreage Holdings is the company that the world s largest marijuana producer  Canopy Growth  has agreed to buy as a means of powering its expansion into the U S  as soon as Washington opens the regulatory framework 

The shares closed down 4 5  yesterday at  4 90 in New York and down 2 4  in Toronto 
Canopy Growth

And speaking of  Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    TSX WEED   it will make public its second quarter earnings before the market open on Thursday  In the last few weeks it has announced the launch of 16 new infused products  including 13 THC  and CBD infused beverages and three chocolate bars that each contain 10 milligrams of THC  All will be readily available for consumers by next month and will be aimed at new non traditional market sectors that will introduce the cannabis experience to non traditional users 

Cowen analyst Vivien Azer has described Canopy s sales as flat  but points to possibly picking up more medical clients from the problem plagued  CannTrust  Holdings  NYSE CTST    TSX TRST   which has ceased all sales after admitting to growing pot in unlicensed rooms 

Canopy Growth shares were down more than 5  Monday  closing at US 20 30  C 26 87  
Aurora Cannabis

Investors who are hanging on to shares of  Aurora Cannabis   NYSE ACB    TSX ACB  should brace themselves for more bad news when it reports after market close on Thursday  according to analysts  The Edmonton based company had predicted profitability on an EBITDA basis last quarter  but failed to hit the mark  The numbers could be worse this quarter 

Aurora shares were down about 5  yesterday  closing at US 3 62  C 4 78   The stock has lost just over 50  of its value in the last year 

Medipharm Labs

 Medipharm Labs   OTC MEDIF    TSX LABS  will be reporting before market today  Based in Barrie  Ont   this Canadian cannabis extraction firm is only traded on the TSX Composite  however  on Nov  5  it applied to list on Nasdaq 
Founded in 2015  this company has emerged as a global leader specializing in cannabis extraction  producing purified pharmaceutical grade cannabis oil and concentrates used in derivative products  With an ever growing number of derivative products coming online for consumers  extraction quality and reliability is growing in demand

198889,420405,MO,Marijuana Stocks Fizzle Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"After growing like a weed last year  marijuana stocks have gone up in smoke so far in 2019 
Excusing the puns  it s been a brutal couple of quarters for Canadian marijuana stocks  After last year s surging interest in the nascent industry  investors  expectations were impossibly high  as the reality of selling an easy to grow plant  it s called  weed  for a reason  in a heavily regulated industry sunk in  traders have become increasingly disillusioned with the outlook for these firms  many of which have yet to reach profitability 





Source  TradingView  FOREX com
That said  the potential market remains compelling and valuations for industry bellwethers are at 2 year lows  leading the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald to come out bullish on the sector last week  One catalyst that could boost leading marijuana stocks as they report earnings this week is heavy short positioning  which could lead to classic  short squeeze  setups on better than expected results in the following firms 

Cronos  CRON    26  of float held short
Tilray  TLRY    38  of float held short
Aurora Cannabis  ACB    19  of float held short
Canopy Growth  CGC    25  of float held short
Below  we highlight some key factors to watch as each of these firms report earnings this week 
1       Cronos   NASDAQ CRON    Narrower Loss  Miss on Revenues 
While Cronos has a relatively small footprint compared to its peers  with minimal presence even in domestic provinces like Quebec and Alberta  it has benefitted from a massive  1 8B investment from  Altria Group   NYSE MO   The firm just reported   0 02 in EPS  beating estimates of a   0 03 loss  though revenues came in lighter than expected at  10 1M  Traders are nonplussed at first glance  with the stock trading down  3  in early trade on Tuesday 
Given the firm s small footprint and major corporate backer  CRON represents one of the highest upside plays in the sector moving forward  albeit with substantial risk as it tries to overcome rivals  early mover advantages 
2      Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY    Elevated Inventories May Weigh on Last Year s Highest Flyer
Tilray garnered top billing around this time last year when the stock surged from around  20 to peak near  300 in about five weeks  Since that mini bubble  though  Tilray has been the worst performing stock in the sector  completing its round trip back to  20 last month  Ahead of Tuesday s earnings report  the key factor to watch was inventories  which were expected to remain elevated  especially for retail clients  Analysts were expecting a   0 30 loss per share on sales of  49M 
3       Aurora Cannabis   TSX ACB    Profitability Dreams Delayed
Aurora was one of the first movers among Canadian cannabis firms  but the company has yet to reach profitability  The company had initially sought to get into the black in the fourth quarter  but that goal looks increasingly remote as new entrants have increased the supply  and therefore driven down the price  of the commodity  Analysts are looking for a loss of   0 05 per share on revenues of  90M in Thursday afternoon s earnings report 
4       Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC    Poised to Capitalize on CannTrust s Troubles
The world s largest marijuana company by market capitalization may be best positioned heading into this week s earnings reports  Rival CannTrust Holdings  NYSE CTST  halted all sales after it was revealed to be growing in unlicensed rooms  potentially opening the door for Canopy Growth to capitalize on medical patients looking for a new provider  For the CGC mothership  analysts are looking for a loss of   0 41 per share on  101 5M in sales Thursday morning  but it will also be worth watching results from  Acreage  Holdings  OTC ACRGF  Tuesday afternoon  which CGC has the right to buy if marijuana is fully legalized in the US 
With these industry leaders  and a swath of second tier producers  all reporting this week  traders will soon have a better idea on whether the industry is poised for a second phase of  weed like  growth or whether the current downtrend will extend into 2020 ",2019-11-12,Matthew Weller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marijuana-stocks-fizzle-ahead-of-earnings-200484726,200484726

   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Altria Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 41  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Tobacco industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases  They re also finding ways to edit the human genome to literally erase our vulnerability to these diseases Zacks has just released Century of Biology  7 Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now to help investors profit from 7 stocks poised for outperformance  Our recent biotech recommendations have produced gains of  98    119  and  164  in as little as 1 month  The stocks in this report could perform even better ",2019-12-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-altria-group-mo-stock-now-200495422,200495422

198902,420418,MO,Addictive nicotine in Juul nearly identical to a Marlboro  study,news,"By Chris Kirkham
 Reuters    The nicotine formula used by controversial e cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc is nearly identical to the flavor and addictive profile of  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc s highly successful Marlboro cigarette brand  new research suggests 
A study released on Tuesday from researchers at Portland State University in Oregon helps to explain why a growing number of young people who never smoked cigarettes have become regular users of Juul vaping devices 
The formulation of Juul s nicotine aerosol was designed to make it far easier for users to inhale larger quantities of nicotine without gagging  gasping or coughing   or even noticing 
 It becomes obvious why novice users  people who ve never smoked before  find it easy to try Juul   said David Peyton  a professor of chemistry at Portland State University who worked on the study  published in the journal Tobacco Control   And once you try it  you re getting dosed with a high concentration of nicotine  
Directly comparing Juul vaping devices to Marlboro cigarettes  the researchers analyzed the amount and chemical makeup of the nicotine in Juul s cartridge like disposable  pods  
In addition to sweet flavors and its sleek  flash drive like design  Juul is notable for popularizing what are known as  nicotine salts   a smoother form of nicotine than what was contained in earlier e cigarettes  according to Juul s own patents and outside research on their formula 
By adding organic acids to liquid nicotine  San Francisco based Juul was able to reduce the amount of  freebase nicotine  in the aerosol that users inhale 
Freebase nicotine  common in e cigarette liquid prior to Juul s arrival in 2015  is harsh and difficult to inhale at high concentrations  Juul virtually eliminated the harsh side effects 
 ALL THE THINGS ABOUT MARLBORO THAT ARE ADDICTIVE 
While e cigarettes have been marketed as a means to help smokers quit or cut down  public health officials have expressed concern that they are drawing a new  younger generation into nicotine addiction  Juul has come under intense scrutiny from regulators  lawmakers and attorneys general over the surging popularity of its products among teenagers in recent years 
A recent study found that nearly 60  of high schoolers and 54  of middle schoolers who use nicotine vaping products said Juul was their usual brand 
Peyton and fellow researchers James Pankow and Anna Duell measured the amounts of nicotine in Juul and how much of that nicotine was in the harsher freebase form of the chemical 
They determined that Juul s potency and flavor profile was almost exactly the same as Marlboro cigarettes  describing Juul as an  e cigarette analog  of the U S  market leading brand 
 Juul is all the things about Marlboro that are addictive   said Pankow  an expert in the chemistry of nicotine and tobacco smoke   Then they take away the bad smell and add some flavors  It s a much more pleasant experience  
Under pressure from regulators and lawmakers  Juul in recent months stopped selling flavors other than menthol and tobacco in the United States  but continues to sell fruit and dessert flavors in other countries 
A study released last month by researchers at Pennsylvania State University found that Juul delivered more nicotine to the bloodstream  and at a faster rate  than earlier e cigarettes  and that its nicotine boost was similar to that of a cigarette 
Juul Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new study s findings 
In an earlier statement  the company said its products were designed to get adult smokers to switch from cigarettes  Therefore the company  sought to create a nicotine based e liquid that mimicked the nicotine experience  in cigarettes  according to the statement 
 Providing a similar nicotine experience was a priority given the fact that early generation e cigarettes had failed in this respect and  as a result  did not convert a significant number of adult smokers from cigarettes   the company said 
Juul cited studies it commissioned showing that between 30  to 50  of adult smokers who use Juul  switch completely from smoking cigarettes within six months  
A separate U S  study released on Monday found that e cigarette use significantly increases the risk of developing chronic lung conditions such as asthma or emphysema 
The Portland State researchers noted that Juul had rapidly duplicated   and improved   a formula that tobacco growers and purveyors took centuries to perfect  A way to deliver potent amounts of nicotine through inhalation 
The tobacco industry for centuries tinkered with the chemistry of nicotine in tobacco through various drying techniques and additives  aiming to make burned tobacco smoother to inhale  the researchers noted 
They said Juul s evolution from earlier e cigarettes was reminiscent of the tobacco industry s cigarette development 
Juul has  essentially duplicated the world s most popular cigarettes  which means this should be attractive to cigarette users   Peyton said   This is probably also a good way to get the curious novice who has never smoked

198903,420419,MO,Trump administration restricts some e cigarette flavors,news,By Chris Kirkham  Reuters    The Trump administration on Thursday announced a ban on some popular e cigarette flavors  including fruit and mint  to curb rising teenage use of vaping products  allowing only menthol and tobacco flavors to remain on the market  The ban came under immediate criticism from public health advocates who said it does not go far enough  But Alex Azar  the U S  Health and Human Services secretary  called the approach a  smart  targeted policy that protects our kids without creating unnecessary disruption   The flavor ban applies to cartridge based e cigarettes  which typically use disposable pods filled with liquid nicotine and are often sold in convenience stores  It does not apply to most e cigarette liquids that are purchased separately  a variety most often sold in vape shops and used in so called open tank e cigarettes  Gary Reedy  chief executive of the American Cancer Society  called it  a hollowed out policy that will allow the tobacco industry to continue to attract kids to a lifetime of nicotine addiction   Representative Frank Pallone  the Democratic chair of the U S  House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee  which has launched probes into e cigarette manufacturers  dismissed the impact of the ban   A flavor ban that exempts menthol and vape shops is no ban at all   Pallone tweeted  President Donald Trump s administration in September proposed a sweeping ban on all e cigarette and vaping flavors that are seen as attracting millions of young users to addictive nicotine products  That plan would have prohibited all e cigarette flavors except tobacco  However  Trump later expressed concerns that enacting the ban could lead to an underground market for illegal vaping products and potential job losses  U S  e cigarette market leader Juul Labs Inc  which is 35  owned by Marlboro maker  Altria Group  Inc  N MO   over the last year has pulled fruit  dessert and mint nicotine flavors from retail stores and its website in the United States amid heightened scrutiny of the surge in teenage use   Thursday s announcement would have no impact on Juul  which has already pulled flavors except tobacco and menthol  It would force competitors still offering a wider variety of flavors  including Njoy and R J  Reynolds Tobacco Co  L BAT   which makes Vuse e cigarettes  to restrict their offerings  The percentage of high schoolers using e cigarettes stands at 27 5   according to federal surveys  up from 20 8  in 2018  Research from the Journal of the American Medical Association found that mint was by far the most popular flavor among U S  10th  and 12th grade Juul users  with more than 40  saying it was the most frequently used variety of nicotine pod   In banning mint but not menthol  HHS Secretary Azar said the administration was following an  evidence based  science based public health approach   Data that became available after the Trump administration s September announcement showed that mint was highly popular among teens but menthol was not  he said  But public health advocates expect that teenagers will simply switch to menthol   The evidence indicates that if menthol e cigarettes are left on the market  kids will shift to them   said Matt Myers  president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids   Decades of experience with menthol cigarettes demonstrate that menthol appeals to kids   The new policy will go into effect in early February  when the U S  Food and Drug Administration will begin enforcing it against e cigarette makers that continue to sell unauthorized flavors  All e cigarette makers face a May deadline to apply to the FDA for permission to continue selling their products   This story has been refiled to delete extraneous comma in headline ,2020-01-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-administration-announces-ban-on-ecigarette-flavors-except-menthol-2051382,2051382
198904,420420,MO,When Will Altria Make the Next Writedown on Its Juul Investment ,news,"The concerted effort against Juul Labs by tobacco regulators is taking its toll  as the electronic cigarette maker s share of the market further eroded at the end of 2019  Where the JUUL device once had north of 80  of the market  it closed out 2019 with about a 60  share  still substantial to be sure  but a clear sign the campaign against it is having the desired effect  
That should have Altria  NYSE MO  investors wondering whether it will take another big writedown of its  12 8 billion investment in the e cig maker  Although Altria just wrote off  4 5 billion worth of its 38  stake in Juul in the third quarter  the continued loss of market share and seemingly insurmountable hurdle Juul faces in navigating its premarket tobacco product application  PMTA  through the Food   Drug Administration s approval process suggests that won t be the last writedown 

A year to forget
Juul had a rough 2019  While the year started on a high note following the huge cash infusion it received from Altria in exchange for a piece of its market leading business  the FDA quickly expressed frustration and anger at both companies  suggesting the investment was actually a sign the two were reneging on their commitment to reduce teen access to e cigs 
It all seemed to go downhill from there  A health scare arose early in the year  with teens suffering from seizures  the FDA said it was investigating a link between them and e cigs  The health scare rose to crisis proportions throughout the summer  and the regulatory agency began urging everyone to stop vaping altogether until it could determine what was causing the rising incidence of illness and several deaths 
Actually  the FDA seemed to have figured out early on that the link wasn t with vaping generally  or with so called closed systems like Juul s where the e liquids used to create a vapor are sealed at the manufacturer  Rather  it was in open systems where third party suppliers could mix their own concoctions  and was a result of teens vaping THC  the psychoactive compound found in marijuana  that was being purchased off the internet  
The illicit sources were using a chemical called vitamin E acetate that  while commonly used in food  apparently causes problems when heated in vaping systems  Thousands of cases of lung injuries and over 50 deaths were reported  
Reversing e cig s rise
Many people apparently listened  E cig sales growth was cut in half while the decline in traditional cigarette sales moderated  suggesting people were quitting e cigs and returning to combustible cigarettes 
Juul also came under scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission over its alleged marketing to teens  the FDA proposed banning e cig flavors  the source of most of Juul s sales  Juul voluntarily stopped manufacturing most flavors ahead of any ban   and major retailers stopped selling e cigs 
As the undisputed market leader  Juul Labs bore the brunt of all of these actions  which can be seen in the collapse of its market share  It also gave Altria s rivals a chance to capitalize on Juul s many misfortunes 
Capitalizing on the forced errors
British American Tobacco s  NYSE BTI  Vuse brand was able to grow its second place position with an 18 1  share of the market  a near 85  year over year gain  while privately held NJOY surged into third place with a 14 4  share on a massive 1 207  jump from the year ago period  That rise  however  was fueled by a significant discounting policy  which was used precisely to steal customers from the competition  and which seems to have worked well  
The December market report by analysts at Cowen   Co  also marked the sixth consecutive time that Juul s share fell  It does not bode well for the e cig maker that must now face FDA approval for its e cig device 
The next painful accounting
Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has already expressed doubts about Juul s ability to make it through the labyrinthine process  and more recently told CNBC   It could be that this product can t exist on the market anymore  
Whether his opinion carries any sway with the current FDA leadership is unknown  but what s obvious is that Juul s value to Altria continues to diminish  While the tobacco giant has a backup plan in place    it is rolling out nationally Philip Morris International s IQOS heated tobacco device  which could come to own the e cig market    it seems certain another dramatic writedown is coming 
That probably won t be when Altria reports fourth quarter results  since it did just write off a huge chunk a few months ago  Yet it wouldn t be surprising to see another writedown happen before 2020 closes  one that may be even bigger than before ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pisf-,2060897
198909,420425,MO,Tides Turn On E Cigarettes  Juul Hiring Down 37  And Workforce Growth Stalls,opinion,"Only five months ago  we were reporting that Juul    hiring had grown by 200  and its workforce size expanded by a cartoonish 400   But things are different these days for the e cigarette market leader as it navigates social and political backlash  
Politicians and local governments are cracking down on e cigarette sales and there are now 18 recorded vaping related deaths in 15 US states   Meanwhile  Juul has reducing its hiring efforts by as much as 37  in just the past two months  To add to Juul potential woes  analysts are now expecting Altria  NYSE MO   which has a 35  stake in the company   
Here s what we re seeing 
Workforce growth slowdown





The number of LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  users listing Juul as their employer continues to rise  but not anywhere near the pace we were seeing just a few months ago  What was once a 51  QoQ growth rate at this point last year is now just 2 1  




Assuming this trend continues  we will likely see workforce attrition at Juul in the coming year 
Hiring plummeting




Perhaps the variable that most points to future growth   or contraction   for Juul can be found in its hiring activity over time  Just two months ago  and right around when states were banning e cigarettes   the company had 685 job openings listed on its careers website   
As of October 1  that number sank to 434  and show little to no signs of recovery  given that the CDC released a report titled  Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with E Cigarette Use  or Vaping  that points to e cigarette related lung injury cases in 48 states and 18 deaths 
New product development 
As Juul collects itself and watches the headlines  categorical shifts in its job openings point to a potential phase of new product development  perhaps indicating a scramble to create alternative e cigarettes that are less harmful 




Like cigarettes before it  Juul is still everywhere




While these signs of contraction are stark  Juul s roaring growth up to this point will be tough   if not impossible   to completely reverse  Juul locations are virtually ubiquitous throughout the United States and Europe 




Just like cigarettes  their availability continued   and continues to this day   to be available at almost any corner shop or gas station  bans  taxes  and CDC warnings or not

Bank of America upgraded  Canopy Growth   NYSE CGC  to buy from neutral  sending its shares more than 14  higher 
It was a little over two months ago that Bank of America found itself on the other side of the fence  downgrading its outlook on the cannabis producer over worries that its valuation was frothy at a time when cannabis orders from some Canadian provinces were slowing  
The shares slumped from a high of  70 98 to as low as  18 23 
Much of the slowing orders were blamed on a lack of retail stores that had caused a glut in inventories  But that has since changed  Channel inventory is getting leaner  and margins are showing signs of growth  according to BofA 
Importantly  Canopy has undertaken measures to improve efficiencies that may for the first time in its history as a public company not only make its valuation reasonable but set it on a path to beat or at least meet the Street estimates  the bank added 
The bullish outlook on the cannabis producer comes in the wake of its second quarter  released last week  that missed analysts  estimates on both the top and bottom lines 
The company blamed the weakness on several factors  including reduced cannabis purchases and fewer than expected retail store openings  But tempered fears  characterizing the collective problems as a  short term headwind

198922,420438,MO,South Korea warns of  serious risk  from vaping  considers sales ban,news,"By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL  Reuters    South Korea on Wednesday advised people to stop using liquid e cigarettes due to growing health concerns and vowed to speed up an investigation into whether to ban sales  a move likely to hit major producers such as Juul and local tobacco company KT G 
While long term health impacts from vaping remain largely unknown  e cigarettes were viewed as a healthier alternative that could help users quit smoking when they were first launched a few years ago 
But countries around the world have been pulling electronic cigarette products from markets and restricting advertising as vaping faces increased scrutiny 
 The current situation is considered as a serious risk to public health   South Korea s health minister Park Neung hoo told a briefing  citing cases of lung injuries associated with e cigarette use in the United States 
U S  health officials have so far reported 33 deaths and 1 479 confirmed and probable cases from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping 
A pneumonia case of a 30 year old South Korean e cigarette user was reported this month  the health ministry said 
 Children  juveniles  pregnant women  and people with pulmonary diseases  never use liquid e cigarettes  Non smokers  too  never use liquid e cigarettes from now   Park said 
Park said the government would speed up its own studies to determine if there was a scientific basis to ban sales of liquid e cigarettes  which vaporize liquid containing nicotine 
A rival technology  which heats but does not burn tobacco  has been authorized by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and has avoided much of the recent regulatory crackdown globally 
REGULATORY CRACKDOWN
South Korea s health ministry vowed to tighten regulations on vaping products such as strengthening customs procedures for imported liquid of e cigarettes 
The South Korean office of U S  e cigarette maker Juul Labs said in a statement their products had no harmful substances  Juul  35  owned by  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  began selling its devices in South Korea in May 
KT G Corp  a South Korean tobacco maker which sells Lil Vapour e cigarettes  said it would cooperate with the government s policies after results of the ongoing probe came out 
Since smoking was banned indoors at places like restaurants and caf s in 2015  South Korea become less tolerant of smokers  But e cigarettes have been gaining popularity in the country s  16 billion tobacco market since 2017 
E cigarettes accounted for 13  of South Korea s tobacco market by sales as of June  according to government data 
South Korea is the world s No 2 market of heated vape products after Japan  worth  1 7 billion  according to Euromonitor  but liquid e cigarettes are less popular

198929,420445,MO,Time To Invest In Marijuana  Read This Now ,opinion,Everything is changing quickly in the marijuana industry and the legal landscape is evolving even faster  Understanding the changes as they occur is going to be extremely important for making successful investment decisions It s an exciting time for investors in this new industry who are now able to purchase shares in companies producing cannabis products for the consumer and medical markets for the first time ever  It has also been somewhat frustrating however  because those investment choices are currently limited by an inconsistent patchwork of laws Major US stock exchanges   quite sensibly   will decline to list any companies who are engaged in illegal activity  and since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level in the US  that means no companies who deal directly with marijuana inside the country are traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ Currently  the marijuana companies an investor can purchase on those exchanges either operate only in other countries where marijuana is completely legal   most notably Canada   or are US companies that provide ancillary services to the marijuana industry but don t handle the products themselves  There s literally even an industry euphemism for that type of business   companies that  Don t touch the plant  Many more companies are now operating in a legal grey area in which they are virtually certain of their immunity from criminal prosecution because they are following the laws of the state in which they do business  yet cannot use traditional banking and credit card services or deduct many expenses when calculating taxes owed  and also cannot list their shares on the major exchanges If marijuana becomes broadly legal at the federal level in the US  there is likely to be a deluge of investment opportunities as a new crop of surprisingly sophisticated new companies seek to raise capital on major exchanges Continued                                                                                                            Legalized marijuana  with almost unimaginable profit potential  has swept over all of Canada  down through 33 states plus D C  This brand new industry is booming from  9 billion in 2017 to an expected  32 billion by 2020  It could soar above  146 billion by 2025 How can you take advantage                                                                                                     With regard to legalization  public opinion has been changing rapidly  with the latest poll from The Hill HarrisX research showing 84  of Americans currently favoring it at the Federal level  For the first time  support for legalization is mostly spread evenly among various age groups and political parties In addition to recent scientific research that suggests that Marijuana is less harmful to users  health than other drugs   including alcohol and cigarettes   proponents of legalization also see a potential tax windfall to be gained in the regulation and taxation of Marijuana products Estimates abound about the potential size of the legal marijuana market ranging from very conservative to wildly exaggerated   including some numbers in the trillions  Careful research estimates that the US market will grow from the  9B that was spent on legal marijuana in 2017 to  32B by 2020  With state and local taxes of up to 25  in many municipalities where recreational sales are legal  it s only natural that states and towns see marijuana sales as a way to shore up strained budgets The state of Colorado collected  68 million in taxes on legal marijuana sales in 2014 and that number has steadily increased to  267 million in 2018  The state passed the  1B mark in total tax revenues early in 2019 Recently though  those tax revenues have in some cases been a disappointment  After many years of legal medical marijuana sales  businesses in the state of California sold  500 million less marijuana in 2018   after it was legal for recreational use   than they did in 2017  The fact that taxes on legal marijuana sales in California range up to 30  seems to be keeping the black market alive States and municipalities now understand they need to balance the desire to collect new tax revenue with the basic economics of pricing There is also a criminal justice reform aspect to legalization  Minorities have been disproportionately incarcerated for non violent marijuana crimes compared to Caucasians  despite evidence that usage rates are similar Personal Beliefs vs Investment Opportunity As the Hill HarrisX poll demonstrates  some Americans do remain uncomfortable with the recent pace of change in efforts to legalize marijuana  That s a perfectly rational position and it s understandable that investors who share this sentiment might be hesitant to buy the shares of companies who sell marijuana Keep in mind however that with a combined  232B in market cap  Phillip Morris International  PM  and Altria  NYSE MO  are owned by millions of Americans  either directly or as a component of ETF and mutual funds   even if those investors personally disapprove of cigarettes If you ve read this far  there s a good chance you can see that there are going to be some really exciting investment opportunities in the marijuana industry Let s take a quick look at how politics and the legislative process might affect the industry Is Marijuana Legal That s no longer an easy question to answer In terms of federal law  the answer is  no   Marijuana remains illegal in the US and is classified as a Schedule 1 drug  The DEA and the Justice Department continue to investigate and prosecute those who violate federal law with regard to marijuana At the state and municipal level  the water is much murkier  Thirty three states allow the cultivation  sale  possession and or use of marijuana for medicinal purposes  and ten States and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for recreational purposes Drilling down even lower  in states where marijuana is legal  counties and cities have generally been empowered to enact their own rules that are more strict than the applicable state law  The result is the patchwork regulatory quilt that means that there are spots in the country where a retail store might sell marijuana products legally  while the same business would be prohibited from operating directly across the street in a different municipality Former Attorney General Eric Holder made it clear that the Justice Department would respect the laws of the individual states and that there would be no federal prosecutions of marijuana crimes as long as the behavior was legal under state law  President Trump s first AG  Jeff Sessions  initially promised to take a much stricter stance on marijuana than the previous administration   but nothing of any significance happened in terms of federal marijuana law enforcement during his tenure  and his departure left that situation unclear Momentum Toward Legalization During confirmation hearings  US Attorney General William Barr  stated that his position on marijuana was similar to Holder s   that the Justice Department would not prosecute any marijuana crimes for behavior that was legal under applicable state laws  He went on to clarify that although he is not personally in favor of legalization  he believes that current state actions amount to a  backdoor nullification of federal law   and stated his preference that Congress act to clarify the legal situation There are currently three pieces of legislation making their way through the halls of Congress that each have a chance of dramatically changing the industry The SAFE Banking Act seeks to eliminate the potential penalties financial institutions face when they do business with a firm that is involved with some aspect of the marijuana business  The bill seeks to ensure that marijuana firms can use banking services just like any other business   make deposits  accept credit card payments and pay their expenses by check  instead of cash The STATES Act reportedly has strong bipartisan support and would essentially codify the Cole memo  The acronym stands for  Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States   and the legislation would formalize the position that each state should be allowed to make its own decision about whether and how to regulate marijuana production and salesIn July  Presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris  D  CA  and US Representative Jerry Nadler  D  NJ  introduced a bill in both houses that would remove marijuana from the controlled substances schedule   effectively decriminalizing it   and also expunge all federal convictions for marijuana offenses The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act  MORE  would establish a 5  national sales tax on marijuana with the proceeds directed to a trust fund that would offer grants  loans and other financial incentives  especially in communities that have been disproportionally affected by the enforcement of marijuana laws  The pace of change we see in the coming months and years will likely be rapid How Can You Profit from the Politics of Pot Future legislation about the legal status of marijuana in the US will almost certainly have a profound impact on the fortunes of the companies in the industry and on the returns of investorsInvesting responsibly in the marijuana space will involve staying abreast of pending developments in legalization   from what s going to be included in referendums on state ballots  all the way to what s happening on the floors of Congress and the Oval OfficeThose who see the potential in this nascent industry would be wise to pay close attention to the politics of pot as they make their investment decisions  Some of the early big gains  and losses  may well be due as much to the results of the political process as to the individual efforts of the companies involved How to Pursue the

198936,420452,MO,U S  House panel asks e cigarette companies to cease advertising,news,"By Bryan Pietsch
WASHINGTON  Reuters    A U S  House panel sent letters to four e cigarette companies asking them to stop all print  broadcast and digital advertising of their products in the United States  the same day as market leader Juul said it would pull its ads  the panel said on Thursday 
The panel s request comes amid an outbreak of lung illnesses across the United States associated with vaping  The U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people to stop using e cigarette or vaping products 
 I am writing today to respectfully  but strongly  request your company to do the same   Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi  chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on economic and consumer policy  wrote on Wednesday to Fontem Ventures  Japan Tobacco International Inc  Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI  and NJOY LLC 
E cigarettes  which heat a liquid often containing nicotine to create an inhalable vapor  have been popular in the United States for around a decade  Manufacturers have faced criticism that too many children use vaping products 
Fontem Ventures  which makes Blu e cigarettes  said in a statement it agrees that children should not use vaping products and that it supports initiatives to prevent youth access to its products  Reynolds American said in a statement it is giving the letter  careful consideration   Japan Tobacco and NJOY did not immediately respond to request for comment 
Claims that products are healthier or safer than traditional cigarettes must be approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  Krishnamoorthi said 
Juul  which dominates the e cigarette market and which  Altria Group  Inc  N MO  has a 35 percent stake in  said on Wednesday it would suspend its advertising and replace its chief executive

Last week  the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  reported 530 cases and seven deaths due to severe lung illnesses 
U S  public health officials have been investigating these illnesses  but have not linked it to any specific e cigarette product 
As of Sept  24  the confirmed deaths were reported in California  Florida  Georgia  Illinois  Indiana  Kansas  Minnesota  Mississippi  Missouri  and Oregon  the CDC said 
The House of Representatives began public hearings about the illness this week while Massachusetts imposed a four month ban on sales of all vaping products  including those used for tobacco and marijuana  which is legal in the state 
Investigators have  however  pointed to vaping oils containing marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol  THC  or vitamin E acetate  a substance used in some THC products  as a possible cause of these illnesses 
The increased scrutiny also prompted leading e cigarette maker Juul Labs to suspend all broadcast  print and digital product advertising in the United States and bring in a longtime  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc executive as its CEO

The acquisition by Cronos of the Los Angeles based Redwood  which markets and distributes CBD infused products under the Lord Jones brand  is a key strategic play that focuses the Toronto based cannabis producer squarely in the CBD market  Lord Jones markets hemp derived CBD based products that include skin creams  bath items and gum drops throughout the United States  CBD  or cannabidiol  is a derivative extracted from the cannabis plant that is touted for its therapeutic qualities and believed to help relieve everything from arthritis to migraines and anxiety  It does not produce a high 





First Push Into U S  CBD Market
The CBD market in the U S  has expanded rapidly this year since the federal government approved the federal farm bill in December 2018 that legalized the growing of hemp  Although hemp and marijuana are both members of the cannabis family  hemp has barely any THC  which is the psychoactive ingredient that produces a high  Hemp also has a higher CBD content and is a heartier plant  making it better suited to be grown outdoors 
The Redwood cash and stock deal is in line with Cronos Group s plan to become a dominant player in the global CBD market  Its first push into the U S  market came earlier this year when it landed a US 1 8 billion deal with cigarette maker  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  Estimates have pegged the U S  CBD market to be worth between US 20 billion and US 24 billion within the next five years 
On Monday  Cronos shares on the Nasdaq were down 3   Markets in Canada were closed for a civic holiday  The Toronto based company is the third largest marijuana company in Canada with a market cap of US 4 63 billion  C 6 12 billion   It has been one of the best performing stocks in the sector  gaining about 136  from this time last year 
Investors in the sector who have very little to celebrate in the last few months will be watching Cronos s earnings report later this week to see if can keep the momentum moving in a positive direction 
Aphria Hits Profitability
The topic of earnings in the cannabis sector easily triggers a conversation about the timeline toward profitability  Of course  in this ever expanding emerging industry that conversation often sounds like a debate with the central question being  When will profitability be realized  That debate was heightened last week when Aphria  TSX APHA     NYSE APHA  released its fourth quarter report that boasted an unexpected profit and an eye popping 969  spike in year over year revenues 
The Canadian cannabis grower reported a profit of US 11 94 million  C 15 76 million  for the quarter that ended May 31  Revenues for the period hit US 97 41 million  C 128 57 million   a 75  increase over the previous quarter and 969  compared with the same period in the previous year  All headline figures  including the amount of cannabis sold  were more than analysts were expecting  The net revenue figures included more than 3 225 kilograms of cannabis sold to for recreational use and 1 417 kilograms of medical marijuana 
Shares of Aphria soared at the end of last week  catapulting more than 42  on the Nasdaq in New York and just over 40  on the S P TSX Composite to close at US 7 32  C 9 67   They slipped on Monday  ending the day down almost 4 4  in New York at US 7 01 
The Aphria results could very well set the standard investors in the sector will be looking for from the other players in the space  adding to the pressure for companies to shorten their timeline to profitability ",2019-08-06,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expectations-high-as-cronos-sets-stage-for-earnings-report-200451175,200451175

198954,420470,MO,Trump administration seeks ban on flavored e cigarettes to combat youth addiction,news,By Jeff Mason and Chris Kirkham WASHINGTON LOS ANGELES  Reuters    The Trump administration announced plans on Wednesday to remove all flavored e cigarettes from store shelves in a widening crackdown on vaping  as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction   President Donald Trump and top U S  officials expressed concern about surging teenage use of e cigarettes  and the move comes as health officials are investigating a handful of deaths and potentially hundreds of lung illnesses tied to vaping  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that  with Trump s blessing  the U S  Food and Drug Administration was working on a  guidance document  that would lead to a ban of all e cigarette flavors aside from tobacco flavoring   Once the FDA would finalize this guidance  we would begin enforcement actions to remove all such products from the marketplace   Azar told reporters during a meeting with the president and first lady Melania Trump in the Oval Office  The ban would include mint and menthol flavoring as well as bubble gum  candy  fruit  alcohol and other flavors  he said   Tobacco flavoring would be allowed to remain  subject to companies  filing for approval from the FDA  Even that would be at risk if the government determined children were attracted to it or that it was being marketed to them  Azar said  The move is the most sweeping action yet by the U S  government to crack down on what it has called an  epidemic  of youth e cigarette usage  The FDA in March formally proposed guidelines that would prohibit the sale of flavored e cigarette products  except mint and menthol  in traditional retail outlets  Under that proposal  which had not been finalized  e cigarette makers could still sell flavored products online and in age restricted stores  such as vape shops  Wednesday s proposal goes much further  banning the sale of all flavored e cigarette products across all retail channels  aside from tobacco flavored products   Despite the increased public attention around teenage e cigarette use over the last year  HHS on Wednesday pointed to data showing that the problem has worsened  Preliminary data shows more than a quarter of U S  high school students used e cigarettes in the past 30 days  That is up from 20 8  last year and 11 7  in 2017  Six deaths have been linked to vaping and U S  public health officials are investigating 450 cases of potential vaping related lung illness across 33 states and one U S  territory  Health officials have cited patients  use of cannabis liquids in many  though not all  of those cases  some of which only involved nicotine vaping   We have a problem in our country  it s a new problem     and it s called vaping  especially vaping as it pertains to innocent children   Trump told reporters in the Oval Office   There have been deaths and there have been a lot of other problems   SURGE IN USE BY ADOLESCENTS Juul Labs Inc  which dominates the U S  e cigarette market  has faced withering criticism over the last two years after becoming wildly popular among teenagers  The company has taken steps to try to reduce its appeal among youth  including pulling flavors except mint and menthol from traditional retail stores  suspending its social media accounts and toughening age verification online  In December  Marlboro maker  Altria Group  Inc  N MO  made a  12 8 billion investment in Juul  taking a 35  stake  Juul spokesman Ted Kwong said  we strongly agree with the need for aggressive category wide action on flavored products   adding the company  will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective    A spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc  L IMB   which sells the Blu line of e cigarettes  declined to comment  Kaelan Hollon  a spokeswoman for R J  Reynolds Tobacco Co  L BATS   which sells Vuse e cigarettes in the United States  did not directly address the proposed flavor ban but said the company shares the administration s goal of keeping products away from youth  Wednesday s move by the White House comes after more than a year of mounting pressure from lawmakers  public health advocates and parents looking to end marketing of products aimed at youth  In recent months state and local governments have also stepped in  In June  San Francisco approved a ban on the sale of all e cigarette products  and last week Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced plans to ban flavored e cigarettes in her state  A nationwide investigation led by the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA has not definitively linked the illnesses to any specific e cigarette product or ingredient  although health officials have expressed suspicions about the effects of inhaling vitamin E acetate  which is contained in some THC vaping products  The FDA has urged consumers to avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate  buying vaping products on the street  using marijuana derived oil with the products or modifying a store bought vape product  While e cigarettes are marketed as tools to help smokers quit  health officials believe some companies are attracting a new generation of nicotine users   Azar said recent data showed a surge in adolescent usage of e cigarettes and that youth were drawn to flavors including mint and menthol  About 8 million U S  adults use such cigarettes and 5 million children were doing so as well   This is exceptionally harmful to our children   he said   An entire generation of children risk becoming addicted to nicotine because of the attractiveness     and availability of these vaping products   E cigarette makers will still have the chance to demonstrate their flavored products serve a public health purpose  All such companies are required to submit applications to the FDA by next May demonstrating their products and proposed flavors provide a net public health benefit  The FDA  after reviewing those applications  could authorize companies to sell flavored products if the agency is satisfied with the proposals

198975,420491,MO,Altria Group Vs Ford Motor  Which High Yielding Stock Is Safer ,opinion,"Investing in high yielding dividend stocks carries a lot of risk  Once you buy a stock that is offering a yield greater than the market average  you re basically making a bet that the company s cash flows will continue to support that payout 
Two top American consumer brands Altria Group  NYSE MO   the maker of Marlboro cigarettes  and Ford Motor Company  NYSE NYSE F  are offering a similar opportunity if you have high risk tolerance  During the past two years  their shares have been under extreme selling pressure  while their dividend yields have soared  Both stocks are offering close to 6  forward yield a highly attractive rate of return when compared with the S P 500 s average yield of less than 2  
Taking a deeper look at the problems they re facing will help us understand whether their inflated yields offer an opportunity or a threat that income investors should avoid 
Altria Group  Tight Regulations  Declining Demand
The past two years have been quite a slippery slope for the U S  s largest cigarette company  It s shares have lost more than 30  of their value since the summer of 2017 as tobacco consumption declines consistently and the regulator readies more stringent rules  Altria stocks fell 20  in July 2017 on the news that the FDA plans to regulate nicotine levels in cigarettes so that they are no longer addictive 
As the company s most recent quarterly report shows  demand continues to dwindle  The company s cigarette shipments dropped 14 3  in the first quarter  after a 4 4  slide the previous period  Due to these headwinds  Altria stock  which traded at  77 29 on June 12  2017  has fallen below  53  This drastic plunge has pushed the stock s annual dividend yield close to 6   making it attractive for income seeking investors 

After highlighting these risks  it s also important to note that Altria has been an excellent dividend stock for a very long time  The company has increased its dividend 53 times in the past 49 years  managing an annual dividend growth rate of 8 9  during the past five years 
But a successful history doesn t guarantee that the future will also be bright  Altria s biggest challenge is to diversify its revenue base quickly to compensate for slowing tobacco consumption in the U S  In that respect  in the past 12 months  Altria made several bold moves to capture new markets 
In December  the company said it will pay  12 8 billion to buy a 35  stake in Juul Labs Inc  a San Francisco based e cigarette startup  In the same month  Altria paid  1 8 billion to Canada s Cronos Group Inc  NASDAQ CRON  to acquire a 45  stake in this marijuana grower 
Ford  Deep Restructuring  Slowing Demand
The world s second largest automaker has been on a tough road for the last few years  After many years of rising sales  helped by the robust global economy and consumer demand  the car maker is now facing powerful headwinds  it s undertaking an  11 billion restructuring  after its net income fell by more than half last year  The turnaround will involve canning thousands of salaried jobs  closing factories overseas  and building capacities to manufacture electric and driverless cars 
Last month  the company produced a better than expected earnings report for the first quarter  but only after it slashed expenses and cut jobs  As Ford undertakes this massive restructuring exercise to improve profitability  investors haven t shown much faith  The stock has fallen more than 30  during the past five years on concerns about the sustainability of its generous  0 15 a share quarterly dividend 

Bearish analysts on Ford stock have built in a potential scenario where Ford s credit rating could be downgraded soon  and its dividends slashed  if the company s turnaround plan fails to produce results 
 Our stock price kind of languished as a result of us slogging through some very necessary but difficult changes   Bloomberg cited Executive Chairman Bill Ford as saying during the company s annual shareholder meeting last week    Our goal is to continue to build the business  and our expectation and hope is that the stock price will respond accordingly  
Which Dividend Is Safer 
Both Altria and Ford offer a different risk reward equation if you have the appetite to take risk  But  in our view  Altria is a better bet  given the company s strong market position and its recent entry into e cigarette and cannabis markets  Along with its existing 10  stake in Inbev  NYSE BUD   the largest beer producer in the world  and now sizeable positions in both Juul and Cronos  Altria is a good long term bet  especially when its dividend yield is at a multiyear high 
Ford  on the hand  is a much riskier proposition to us  In our view  the company s dividend is highly vulnerable if the economy goes into a recession and demand for gas guzzling big trucks and SUVs evaporates  A similar combination forced Ford to eliminate its dividend in 2006  which it resumed in 2012  Another reason that makes traditional car makers a less attractive investment option  in our view  is a growing consumer trend in which ride sharing is becoming a new norm  which eliminates much of the need to own a car ",2019-05-17,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-group-vs-ford-motor-which-highyielding-stock-is-safe-200422381,200422381
198976,420492,MO,Aurora  Tilray And Cronos Blaze Distinctive Trails In Cannabis Sector,opinion,"Three of the big cannabis companies Aurora Cannabis  Tilray and Cronos Group released their latest earnings in the last two weeks  giving investors and observers a little more insight into the expanding new markets that have not quite come into focus yet  But despite the lack of clarity on how the market will react in the ramp up to the second phase of legalization of marijuana that will see edibles and infused products hit the retail market in Canada later this year  the reports provided a fresh opportunity to compare and contrast these players based on a number of top metrics 
Let s look at how these companies line up 
1  Aurora Cannabis  TO ACB  is the biggest of these three  With a market cap of US 8 83 billion  C 11 88 billion   it is one of the leading medical marijuana producers in the world  Overall  the Canadian company  based in Edmonton  reported a lower net loss and higher revenues for the quarter that ended March 31 
The net loss for the quarter came in at C 158 million  US 117 63   due mainly to continued expansion of its cultivation facilities  This figure is 33  lower than the net loss of  C237 million  US 177 44  reported in the previous quarter 
Its latest quarterly revenues increase to C 65 1 million  US 48 41   up 20  from C 54 18 million  US 40 34  the previous quarter  Contributing to that growth was a 37  increase in recreational sales  an 8  rise in Canadian medical sales and a 40  uptick in international medical sales 
Since reporting  its stock price has gained steadily  from US 8 02  C 10 83  to US 8 99  C 12 12   and closing last week at US 8 68  C 11 71  
2  Over at Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   the latest reporting on May 14 was a bit of a mixed bag  Net loss for the quarter was pegged at US 30 3 million  up substantially compared with US 5 18 million in the same quarter last year  Meanwhile  revenues for the period catapulted 195 1  compared with the same period in 2018  The engines that fueled that leap were increased marijuana sales and hemp food sales courtesy of its recent acquisition of retail hemp producer Manitoba Harvest 
Tilray president and CEO Brendan Kennedy said 

 We have made significant progress integrating our recent acquisitions of Manitoba Harvest and Natura Naturals  accelerating our entry into the United States hemp and CBD markets  and increasing our production and manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe  

But the revenue jump was not enough to move investors  Its stock price  which had been about US 47  initially jumped following the release of the numbers  hitting US 48 84  before dropping to US 46 22  It closed last week at US 45 66 confirming that much of the positive results had already been priced in 

All charts powered by TradingView
But observers should keep a keen eye on retail hemp sales  which could serve as an early indication of the popularity of the edible products to come 
3  A week earlier  Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON   a Toronto based company that is about the same size as Tilray with a market cap of US 4 96 billion  C 6 68 billion   released its first quarter earnings  only to see its stock take a hit  Shares lost a little more than 8 8  during the day on the news after announcing it anticipates adjusted earnings to drop over the remainder of 2019 
But the stock bounced back  almost returning share prices to about the very spot they were earlier in the week 

Cronos In Focus
Cronos reported C 6 5 million  US 4 8  in revenue for the three month period ending March 31  Although this figure marked a 15  gain compared with the previous quarter  it was below analyst estimates  The increase in revenue was driven mainly by an increase in CBD oil sales  the company said in a statement 
The revenue from CBD oil  valued for its therapeutic properties  represented 23  of net product revenue in the first quarter of 2019  In the first quarter of 2018  it was only 9  of revenue 
Again  the growing popularity of pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications will be a key item to watch 
Also in the last quarter  Cronos completed its  2 4 billion deal with Altria Group  NYSE MO   the U S  based cigarette maker  Building on this partnership  the company earlier this month opened Cronos Device Labs  a research facility based in Israel and designed to develop vaporizer products designed specifically for cannabinoid applications  The firm s chairman  president and CEO Mike Gorenstein said 

 Cronos Device Labs will play an important role in positioning the company for long term success by enabling us to build innovative vaporizer products that resonate with our customers and generate shareholder value  

It will be interesting to watch where the stock goes from here before the vaporizers hit the market ",2019-05-21,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aurora-tilray-and-cronos-continue-to-blaze-distinctive-trails-in-cannabis-sector-200422967,200422967
198977,420493,MO,Altria  MO  Up 1 9  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Altria  MO   Shares have added about 1 9  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Altria due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Altria s Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates  High Interests HurtAltria released first quarter 2019 results  with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining year on year  High interest expenses were a major deterrent on the bottom line  Also  the top line was unimpressive  thanks to sluggishness in the smokeable category  Moreover  lower shipment volumes in the smokeable and smokeless categories dented quarterly results Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 90 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents  Earnings declined 5 3  year over year due to higher interest expenses and reduced adjusted equity earnings related to AB InBev Net revenues contracted 7 9  year over year to  5 628 million  Lower revenues in the smokeable unit marred top line performance  Revenues net of excise taxes fell 6  to  4 389 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at  4 541 million Also  in the quarter under review  gross profit fell 4 3  to  2 811 million from the prior year quarter s tally Segment DetailsSmokeable Products  Net revenues in the category fell 8 8  year over year to  4 935 million  thanks to lower shipment volumes  This was partially offset by higher pricing and lower promotional investments  Revenues net of excise taxes contracted 7  year over year to  3 732 million Total shipment volume in the category declined 14 1  from the prior year quarter s tally  Also  domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 14 3  year over year due to inventory movements  lower cigarette industry volumes  decline in retail share and one less shipping day  During the quarter  the company s total cigarette retail share dipped 0 7 percentage point to reach 49 8  Adjusted OCI in the segment slid 0 2  to  1 991 million due to lower shipment volumes  The downside was offset by improved pricing as well as reduced promotional investments and costs  Adjusted OCI margins improved 3 6 percentage points to 53 3  Smokeless Products  Net revenues in the segment improved 2 9  from the year ago quarter s figure to  540 million  driven by higher pricing and reduced promotional investments  These were partially countered by low shipment volumes  Also  revenues net of excise taxes increased 3 2  to  509 million in the quarter Domestic shipment volumes in the category declined 2 2   Total smokeless products retail share inched up 0 1 percentage point to 53 9  Adjusted OCI rose 7 9  to  367 million owing to improved pricing as well as reduced promotional investments and costs  These were partially offset by lower shipment volumes  Adjusted OCI margin expanded 3 1 percentage points to 72 1  Wine  Net revenues increased 6 3  year on year to   151 million  courtesy of higher shipment volumes  The uptick was partially countered by increased promotional spending  The segment s revenues  net of excise taxes went up 6 6  to  146 million  Wine shipment volume increased 8  to 1 9 million cases Adjusted OCI in the category declined 11 8  to  15 million as a result of higher costs and promotional expenses  somewhat offset by improved shipment volume  Adjusted OCI margin contracted 2 1 percentage point to 10 3  Financial UpdatesIn the first quarter  the company paid dividends worth almost  1 5 billion  The company s annualized dividend rate is currently pegged at  3 20 per share  Further  management is on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80  of the bottom line Further  the company repurchased 2 7 million shares for approximately  151 billion in the first quarter  As of Mar 31  2018  Altria had around  195 million remaining under the share repurchase program of  2 billion  which is expected to be completed by the end of second quarter 2019 Other DevelopmentsDuring the quarter  the company closed investment in Cronos Group Inc  worth almost  1 8 billion  As a result  Altria controls 45  economic and voting rights in Cronos along with a warrant to acquire additional stake  Also  during the quarter  Altria filed an application with the U S  FTC for the conversion of its rights in JULL to voting securities The term loan pertaining to these investments was repaid by Altria through the issue of debt worth  16 3 billion In December  the company revealed a cost reduction program aimed at delivering annualized cost savings of nearly  575 million by the end of 2019  In addition to efforts pertaining to cost minimization across several platforms  the program is aimed to reduce workforce and third party spending  During the first quarter  the company recorded pre tax charges of  61 million in relation to this program OutlookManagement restated the guidance for 2019  wherein it expects adjusted earnings in the range of  4 15  4 27  which suggests year over year growth of 4 7   Moreover  Altria expects domestic cigarette industry volume to decline in the range of 4 5   Further  the company expects 2019

198978,420494,MO,Time To Invest In Marijuana  Read This Now ,opinion,"Everything is changing quickly in the marijuana industry and the legal landscape is evolving even faster  Understanding the changes as they occur is going to be extremely important for making successful investment decisions 
It s an exciting time for investors in this new industry who are now able to purchase shares in companies producing cannabis products for the consumer and medical markets for the first time ever  It has also been somewhat frustrating however  because those investment choices are currently limited by an inconsistent patchwork of laws 
Major US stock exchanges   quite sensibly   will decline to list any companies who are engaged in illegal activity  and since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level in the US  that means no companies who deal directly with marijuana inside the country are traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ 
Currently  the marijuana companies an investor can purchase on those exchanges either operate only in other countries where marijuana is completely legal   most notably Canada   or are US companies that provide ancillary services to the marijuana industry but don t handle the products themselves  There s literally even an industry euphemism for that type of business   companies that  Don t touch the plant  
Many more companies are now operating in a legal grey area in which they are virtually certain of their immunity from criminal prosecution because they are following the laws of the state in which they do business  yet cannot use traditional banking and credit card services or deduct many expenses when calculating taxes owed  and also cannot list their shares on the major exchanges 
If marijuana becomes broadly legal at the federal level in the US  there is likely to be a deluge of investment opportunities as a new crop of surprisingly sophisticated new companies seek to raise capital on major exchanges 
Continued      
                                                                                                      

Legalized marijuana  with almost unimaginable profit potential  has swept over all of Canada  down through 33 states plus D C  This brand new industry is booming from  9 billion in 2017 to an expected  32 billion by 2020  It could soar above  146 billion by 2025 
Stock gains like 43 7  in 2 weeks and  856 1  in 2 months are already being generated  Not since the Repeal of Prohibition in 1933 has there been such a release of pent up demand 
How can you take advantage 

                                                                                                      
With regard to legalization  public opinion has been changing rapidly  with the latest Pew research poll showing 62  of Americans currently favoring it at the Federal level  Those results show some significant differences of opinion based on age and political affiliation  with younger and more politically liberal respondents much more likely to support legalization than those who are older and or more politically conservative 
In addition to recent scientific research that suggests that Marijuana is less harmful to users  health than other drugs   including alcohol and cigarettes   proponents of legalization also see a potential tax windfall to be gained in the regulation and taxation of Marijuana products 
Estimates abound about the potential size of the legal marijuana market ranging from very conservative to wildly exaggerated   including some numbers in the trillions  Careful research estimates that the US market will grow from the  9B that was spent on legal marijuana in 2017 to  32B by 2020  With state and local taxes of up to 25  in many municipalities where recreational sales are legal  it s only natural that states and towns see marijuana sales as a way to shore up strained budgets 
The state of Colorado collected  68 million in taxes on legal marijuana sales in 2014 and that number has steadily increased to  267 million in 2018  The state passed the  1B mark in total tax revenues early in 2019 
Recently though  those tax revenues have in some cases been a disappointment  After many years of legal medical marijuana sales  businesses in the state of California sold  500 million less marijuana in 2018   after it was legal for recreational use   than they did in 2017  The fact that taxes on legal marijuana sales in California range up to 30  seems to be keeping the black market alive 
States and municipalities now understand they need to balance the desire to collect new tax revenue with the basic economics of pricing 
There is also a criminal justice reform aspect to legalization  Minorities have been disproportionately incarcerated for non violent marijuana crimes compared to Caucasians  despite evidence that usage rates are similar 
Personal Beliefs vs Investment Opportunity
As the Pew Research polls demonstrate  a significant number of Americans remain uncomfortable with the recent pace of change in efforts to legalize marijuana  That s a perfectly rational position and it s understandable that investors who share this sentiment might be hesitant to buy the shares of companies who sell marijuana 
Keep in mind however that with a combined  232B in market cap  Phillip Morris International  PM  and Altria  NYSE MO  are owned by millions of Americans  either directly or as a component of ETF and mutual funds   even if those investors personally disapprove of cigarettes 
If you ve read this far  there s a good chance you can see that there are going to be some really exciting investment opportunities in the marijuana industry 
Let s take a quick look at how politics and the legislative process might affect the industry 
Is Marijuana Legal 
That s no longer an easy question to answer 
In terms of federal law  the answer is  no   Marijuana remains illegal in the US and is classified as a Schedule 1 drug  The DEA and the Justice Department continue to investigate and prosecute those who violate federal law with regard to marijuana 
At the state and municipal level  the water is much murkier  Thirty three states allow the cultivation  sale  possession and or use of marijuana for medicinal purposes  and ten States and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for recreational purposes 
Drilling down even lower  in states where marijuana is legal  counties and cities have generally been empowered to enact their own rules that are more strict than the applicable state law  The result is the patchwork regulatory quilt that means that there are spots in the country where a retail store might sell marijuana products legally  while the same business would be prohibited from operating directly across the street in a different municipality 
Former Attorney General Eric Holder made it clear that the Justice Department would respect the laws of the individual states and that there would be no federal prosecutions of marijuana crimes as long as the behavior was legal under state law  President Trump s first AG  Jeff Sessions  initially promised to take a much stricter stance on marijuana than the previous administration   but nothing of any significance happened in terms of federal marijuana law enforcement during his tenure  and his departure left that situation unclear 
Momentum Toward Legalization
During confirmation hearings  US Attorney General William Barr  stated that his position on marijuana was similar to Holder s   that the Justice Department would not prosecute any marijuana crimes for behavior that was legal under applicable state laws  He went on to clarify that although he is not personally in favor of legalization  he believes that current state actions amount to a  backdoor nullification of federal law   and stated his preference that Congress act to clarify the legal situation 
There are currently two pieces of legislation making their way through the halls of Congress that each have a chance of dramatically changing the industry 
The SAFE Banking Act seeks to eliminate the potential penalties financial institutions face when they do business with a firm that is involved with some aspect of the marijuana business  The bill seeks to ensure that marijuana firms can use banking services just like any other business   make deposits  accept credit card payments and pay their expenses by check  instead of cash  
The STATES Act reportedly has strong bipartisan support and would essentially codify the Cole memo  The acronym stands for  Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States   and the legislation would formalize the position that each state should be allowed to make its own decision about whether and how to regulate marijuana production and sales 
The pace of change we see in the coming months and years will likely be rapid 
How Can You Profit from the Politics of Pot 
Future legislation about the legal status of marijuana in the US will almost certainly have a profound impact on the fortunes of the companies in the industry and on the returns of investors 
Investing responsibly in the marijuana space will involve staying abreast of pending developments in legalization   from what s going to be included in referendums on state ballots  all the way to what s happening on the floors of Congress and the Oval Office 
Those who see the potential in this nascent industry would be wise to pay close attention to the politics of pot as they make their investment decisions  Some of the early big gains  and losses  may well be due as much to the results of the political process as to the individual efforts of the companies involved 
How to Pursue the Big Profits
At Zacks we re monitoring political developments very closely as well as tracking individual stocks 
As I mentioned earlier  this space is skyrocketing from  9 billion in 2017 to an expected  32 billion within the next 2 years  Yet only a few growers  pharmaceuticals  financial firms  suppliers   both established and start ups   are the true innovators and offer exceptional profit potential 
So if you don t want to devote the constant attention and painstaking analysis to find these often little known tickers  we can find them for you 
You re invited to take part in the portfolio service I m directing

198987,420503,MO,Global Cannabis Market Can Expect Continued Growth ,opinion,"Growth markets must withstand the test of time before they realize their true potential  Between the year 2013 2014  the impact of the cannabis industry was perceived to be both a potential growth market and short term hype 
And when the cryptocurrency industry began to weave itself into the investment philosophies of many  cannabis appeared to take backstage for a while only to re emerge with a boom in the last few quarters  And now  cannabis has become once again one of the most promising industries in the stock market as highlighted by a string of mergers and acquisitions 
But what exactly has changed over the last few years to firmly confirm the cannabis industry as one of the best growth markets for stock investors  Well  everything revolves around legalization 
Globally  Cannabis has received at least one form of legalization in 40 countries with a gigantic chunk of that figure achieved over the last 5 years  In the US  medical cannabis is legal  in some form  in 33 states while recreational marijuana has been greenlighted in 10 states  And now  there is a great deal of expectation that it is only a matter of time before the U S  Federal Legalization of cannabis takes place 
In fact  there is a bipartisan group of senators and representatives of the U S  Congress that are trying to speed up things a bit  This group recently introduced the STATES  Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States  Act  which will prevent the Federal government from intervening in states that legalize marijuana  The general view in the market is that this would effectively make marijuana legal at the Federal level in much of the U S  thus paving the way for more states to embrace it 
If this happens and marijuana is Federally legalized in the US  it could result in an instant spike in annual sales in the cannabis industry according to a recent report by Barclays  LON BARC   The report says that if Marijuana was legal in the US today  it would generate annual sales of  28 billion  which would stretch to over  40 billion within the next decade 
This estimate is backed by several figures  This has accelerated the consolidation phase in the cannabis market as companies look to pounce on the lucrative US cannabis industry  According to a report published last year by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   about 26 million people aged 12 years and above in the U S  are users of Marijuana  A 2017 national survey revealed 
This statistic may not be most pleasing to the department of substance abuse and mental health  but companies investing in the cannabis industry will be looking at it as an opportunity that they can capitalize on 
This is why the U S  is currently one of the hottest destinations for foreign marijuana companies looking to expand their addressable market  Some of them have focused on acquiring small startups offering specific products like recreational marijuana and cannabidiol  CBD  oils  But there have also been multi billion dollar acquisitions and investments made in a bid to improve strategic positioning ahead of the expected boom in the industry 
Some of the highlight acquisitions of the last few quarters involved Canadian Cannabis giants Aurora Cannabis Inc  TO ACB  and Canopy Growth Corp  NYSE CGC  
Around mid last year  Aurora Cannabis acquired MedReleaf for  3 2 billion  which was at the time the largest acquisition in the history of the cannabis industry  This acquisition brought together two of the world s largest players in the market in a vertically integrated business model 
Vertical integration has been the main focus in the consolidation of the industry with cannabis dispensaries being the most sought after by well established players  Now  the combination of the two companies gives Aurora Cannabis a production capacity of about 550 000 kilograms of marijuana per year and a funded capacity of 650 000 kilograms through 2020 
This deal was the biggest in the industry until recently when Canopy Growth announced its plan to purchase British Columbia based cannabidiol  CBD  focused company Acreage Holdings  CNSX ACRG U  for a reported figure of  3 4 billion  This gives Canopy Growth access to already legalized hemp CBD products market in the US 
And while the value of this section of the cannabis industry may be dwarfed by projections for the marijuana market  its legal status in the US and other markets across the world might be more lucrative to investors in the short term 
This is the same strategy employed by another Canadian cannabis company Green Thumb Industries Inc   CNSX GTII   which acquired Las Vegas based recreational marijuana dispensary company Essence Cannabis for a reported figure of  290 million  These acquisitions are happening all over the industry  And some of them like Aurora Cannabis have made more than one acquisition in the last few quarters 
In fact  even companies operating in sister industries like the makers of Marlboro cigarettes Altria Group Inc   NYSE MO  have joined the bandwagon  After making  12 8 billion investment in e cigarette maker Juul for a reported stake of about 35   Altria has now turned its attention to the marijuana market  The company took a 45  stake in Canada based Cronos Group Inc  NASDAQ CRON  after committing  1 8 billion investment as it continues to expand its empire in the smoking business 
Alcohol brewing companies  soft drink makers have also shown interest in the rapidly growing cannabis industry  which again highlights the diversity of industries that are looking to infuse some of their products with cannabis extracts 
Clearly  with US Federal legalization presumably around the corner in addition to the global progress shown in a number of countries that have already embraced cannabis  the future looks a lot brighter for the industry 
The US will account for the largest market share if marijuana is legalized at the Federal level and this explains why every company wants to position itself in readiness for this key milestone 
Conclusion
In summary  the global cannabis market is beginning to take shape with several countries already embracing at least one form of cannabis use  medical marijuana  CBD oils  or recreational marijuana  among others  
The U S  is potentially the largest single cannabis market in the world but lack of Federal legalization has held back its growth  Now  it looks like legalization is close  which is why investors are getting excited about the U S  cannabis market ",2019-05-07,Nicholas Maithya,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-us-cannabis-market-is-getting-investors-excited-200417818,200417818

198996,420512,MO,Fearing tobacco s fate  palm oil industry fights back,news,"By A  Ananthalakshmi and Emily Chow
KUALA LUMPUR  Reuters    On the morning of Feb  26  executives from a Washington consultancy presented a strategy paper to some of the most powerful officials in the Malaysian palm oil industry 
The message  Don t allow environmental activists and Western governments to tarnish palm oil to the extent that it ends up a pariah product  like tobacco 
The  60 billion palm oil trade has been vilified by environmentalists because of the vast areas of tropical rainforest they say have been cleared to grow the commodity that is consumed by billions of people 
Malaysia and Indonesia  which together produce about 85  of the world s palm  had been largely passive in response  comfortable in relying on the sustainability of demand for an oil used for cooking and in items like soaps and shampoos  snack foods  pizza  bread and biodiesel  Food accounts for nearly 70  of global consumption of palm oil 
But last year  Malaysia launched a global public relations and lobbying offensive to protect the reputation of its key export  particularly in Europe  Reuters has pieced together a picture of the sweeping effort from internal public relations strategy documents as well as interviews with dozens of palm oil industry participants 
The European Union passed an act earlier this year to phase out palm oil from renewable fuel by 2030 due to deforestation concerns  While demand for palm oil used in EU biodiesel accounts for a fraction of global supply  palm oil producers in Malaysia and Indonesia worry the law could spur calls for regulation in its usage in food 
Malaysia has led the PR offensive since the EU began working on the law  as it is far more reliant on exports than larger rival Indonesia  and ships about 85  of its total palm oil production overseas annually 
Malaysia and Indonesia key palm oil statistics   
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said the EU law was  grossly unfair  and was an attempt to protect alternative oils that Europe produced itself 
The publicity campaign aimed at critics of palm oil has been coordinated by the Malaysian Palm Oil Council  MPOC   a state agency responsible for promoting palm oil and looking for trade opportunities for the product 
The agency is funded at least partly by a fee paid by plantation companies based on palm oil production  MPOC s board includes representatives from plantation companies  including  Sime Darby Plantation  Bhd  KL SIPL   the world s biggest oil palm planter by land  and IOI Corp  KL IOIB  
The representatives of the two companies did not respond to requests for comment 
Its campaign is centered around small holder farmers  carried out by platforms that say they represent farmers but are created or run by PR firms hired by the MPOC  the strategy documents dated Aug 6  2018 and Feb 26  2019  show 
MPOC has also approved funding news sites  researchers  op eds and former politicians to speak up for palm oil and undermine the EU law  the documents show 
None of the groups or individuals identified in the proposals have been transparent about their funding and have often claimed to be independent voices 
At least three PR firms hired by the MPOC are running these campaigns  copies of their proposals seen by Reuters show  The MPOC approved all their proposals  according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter 
LOBBYIST FOR TOBACCO  OIL
The main company involved in the strategy is the DCI Group  a Washington based public relations firm that has previously developed campaigns for tobacco and oil multinationals  Its clients have included Altria  N MO  and the former Burmese military junta  according to U S  public records and DCI itself 
Asked by Reuters for comment on its strategy  DCI said it was engaged in the Malaysian campaign but did not give details 
 We are proud to work with Malaysia s palm oil industry in its fight to defend the jobs and livelihoods of small farmers against unfair trade and environmental policies which perpetuate global poverty   said Justin Peterson  managing partner at DCI Group  in an e mail 
The MPOC has not spoken publicly about the campaign  It told Reuters that it uses various methods  including engagement of PR agencies and advisory firms  to pursue its objectives  but for competitive and client confidentiality reasons  it would not disclose details 
 Industries and governments across the world engage in an array of efforts to defend their national interests  In MPOC s case  however  we ensure that all such activities are above board and are in accord with local rules and regulations governing such engagements   the MPOC said 
The Malaysian ministry in charge of palm oil declined comment 
The other two firms running PR campaigns are  Kuala Lumpur based Invoke  run by Rafizi Ramli  a former Malaysian lawmaker  and Unitas Communications  a PR firm with offices in London and Jeddah 
Invoke runs its campaign through the  Planters United  platform  which describes itself as a non governmental organization made up of smallholder farmers  according to a Feb  26 copy of its proposal seen by Reuters 
Unitas  Rafizi and Invoke did not respond to calls and emails for comment 
EU lawmakers declined to talk about lobbying by the palm oil industry but environmental group Greenpeace said the lobbying by Malaysia had resulted in the EU law relating to biodiesel being diluted 
Officials at the European parliament were not available for comment and Reuters was unable to independently confirm this 
REASONING WON T WORK
According to documents reviewed by Reuters  DCI s campaign pitch to the MPOC this year sought a budget of over  1 million  The MPOC approved the budget after negotiating the price slightly down  the two sources said 
MPOC also approved a 2019 budget of around  120 000 for Invoke and  200 000 for Unitas  the sources said 
MPOC and the three PR companies did not comment on the amounts and whether it was approved 
Reuters has seen a copy of an eight page public affairs proposal distributed by DCI at the February 26 meeting with at least a dozen officials from MPOC  the Malaysian ministry of primary industries and palm oil companies  The proposal said   The eco colonialists have turned to a scorched earth approach of junk science and faulty logic  they label palm oil as the new tobacco  
 Attempting to reason with these opponents  through dialogue or scientific research will not stop their attacks and will not advance Malaysia s position  
The document did not name the  eco colonialists  but in previous paragraphs it refers to the EU 
Farmers should be the  primary messengers  globally of the campaign against critics of palm oil  DCI said in a previous proposal to MPOC  in August  2018 
 Small farmers are Malaysia s most powerful weapon against Europe and the NGOs   it said 
DCI has been running or coordinating grassroots campaigns through front groups such as Farmers Unite  DCI s campaign proposals from August 2018 and February 2019 show 
Farmers Unite says on its website it is a global coalition of oil palm small farmer associations and other supporting organizations  and that it speaks for more than 7 million oil palm smallholders across the world 
It did not respond to requests for comment 
Farmers Unite took out full page advertisements last December in the UK against British retailer Iceland when the company said it would stop selling in house products containing palm oil  Iceland says it has ended the use of palm oil in such products by the end of 2018 
Iceland declined to comment on the Farmers Unite campaign 
In August 2018  DCI pitched to the MPOC the creation of an African platform with the help of Nigerian think tank  the Initiative for Public Policy Analysis  IPPA   saying  recruiting support from African allies is necessary to put maximum pressure on your opponents  
 These are weak spots for EU NGOs and politicians   they fear accusations of neo colonialism and discrimination   the proposal said 
In its next presentation in February  2019  DCI asked for a budget of  10 000 per month for Farmers Unite  which it described as a project of IPPA  IPPA has previously opposed tougher legislation against tobacco products in Nigeria  citing the negative impact on farmers and investment 
IPPA said  where we raise our money and get support is immaterial  
In its August 2018 proposal  DCI also set out a strategy to use a group called Faces of Palm Oil  which says it represents 650 000 farmers in Malaysia  in the campaign 
 Faces of Palm Oil will once again serve as the campaign hub  and small farmers should be the primary messengers in Malaysia  European and international media   DCI said in the proposal 
Faces of Palm Oil has been the most vocal farmers  group on social media  criticizing NGOs  EU lawmakers and journalists  based on its social media feed and environmental groups tracking palm oil  It says on its website it is a joint project of three major farmers  groups and other bodies 
Faces of Palm Oil did not respond to a request for comment 
MPOC did not comment on the funding of the farmers  groups 
PAID OP EDS
DCI has also sought to influence opinion through paying for news articles  columns and research  according to the documents seen by Reuters 
This year  for example  DCI asked the MPOC to provide a budget of  11 000 a month to a newsletter called Palm Oil Monitor  according to the February proposal  The newsletter has been publishing news stories and behind the scenes information on the negotiations of the EU law  scooping mainstream media on the contents of Mahathir s strongly worded letters to European leaders  The plan was accepted  the two sources said 
Khalil Hegarty  one of the two authors of Palm Oil Monitor  told Reuters in an emailed statement that the newsletter  benefited from support from various sources  including industry sources    He declined to provide specifics 




Hegarty said  we don t lobby  and any insinuation that Palm Oil Monitor is a part of some grand lobbying effort would be inaccurate  ",2019-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fearing-tobaccos-fate-palm-oil-industry-fights-back-1959861,1959861

199009,420525,MO,3 Cannabis Stocks Down Since Q4 Earnings  But Don t Count Them Out Just Yet,opinion,"What a difference a few weeks can make in the weed business  Over the past 14 days  three prominent players in the cannabis space  Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON    TO CRON   and CannTrust Holdings  NYSE CTST    TO TRST   each reported quarterly earnings 
In the aftermath  their once hot stocks took serious hits  CannTrust in particular  which  reported this past Thursday  suffered a serious drubbing that left its shares recovering from a 23  plunge 
Are marijuana stocks simply too volatile for regular investors  Has the promise of legalized cannabis and the businesses it spawned been overstated  And  perhaps most important for those waiting on the sidelines  wondering whether to jump into this emerging sector which has already produced triple digit gains for some equity investors  is it time to buy the dip 
Before taking a deeper look at the fundamentals of each stock  two key takeaways should be noted 
1  The most recent quarterly earnings reports were the first for the entire period during which marijuana was legal in Canada  This is significant since the black and white numbers on a spreadsheet for the past quarter don t tell the full story  Investors whether current or potential need to understand that this is newly discovered business territory  one that s endured a far from perfect roll out of the new regulatory framework aimed at structuring the legalization of the product 
2  Investors must keep in focus the environment in which these companies operate  Cannabis is more than just a recreational use drug  It is a disruptor that has the potential to change markets in several sectors  tobacco  alcoholic beverages  pharmaceuticals  wellness  pet care and a wide range of are simply called edibles cereals  chocolates  baked goods among them 
So what did we actually learn about the health of these three companies during their Q4 2018 reports 
Tilray
Since reporting on Monday  March 18  the Canadian firm that s only listed on the NASDAQ saw its shares drop 10 65   closing last Friday at  65 52 a share 

The company reported a 203 8  increase in revenues for the quarter compared to the same period last year  Overall in 2018  revenues were up 110  compared with 2017 
Tilray s net loss for the year was pegged at  67 7 million  or 82 cents a share  compared with  7 8 million  or 10 cents a share in 2017  Net losses for the fourth quarter were  31 million  or 33 cents a share  compared with  3 million  or 4 cents a share  in the fourth quarter of 2017 
Notwithstanding  its expansion and strategic partnership deals in 2018 were notable  Tilray signed a deal with Sandoz  a division of pharma giant Novartis  NYSE NVS  to provide increased access to medical cannabis to patients across the globe  It also signed a research and development partnership with Anheuser Busch Inbev  NYSE BUD   the world s largest brewer  to develop non alcoholic THC and CBD beverages  THC is the element in pot that produces the so called  high   while CBD is purported to contain medicinal benefits 
Tilray also announced a long term  revenue sharing alliance with Authentic Brands Group  a New York based brand development company  to leverage its brand portfolio to develop  market and distribute consumer cannabis products around the world 
Cronos
Cronos shares have slipped 9 7  since the company s March 26 report 

The company reported a net loss of  11 6 million net in the period ending Dec  31  2018  compared with a profit in the same quarter at the end of 2017  Net revenues were  5 6 million for Q4 2018  compared with  1 6 million for the same quarter of 2017  an increase of  4 million  or 248  
Revenues for all of 2018 increased to  15 7 million  a 285  leap from the  4 1 million brought in during full year 2017 
Investors are keeping a keen eye on the company s performance in the recreational segment of the market  As well  they re watching how successful it may have been at expanding its production capacity  It reported the establishment of new growing facilities and additional joint ventures with companies in Australia and Israel 
The company reported total operating expenses of  12 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  compared with  2 9 million for the same period in 2017  a  9 5 million  or 328  boost  For full year 2018  operating expenses were pegged at  29 4 million  compared with  9 3 million the previous year  215  higher 
Last quarter  Cronos received an infusion of cash as U S  cigarette maker Altria Group  NYSE MO  bought a 45  stake for C 2 4 billion  USD  1 8B  The deal was finalized earlier this month  Altria has the option to acquire an additional 55  stake within four years  which would give it majority control of the company 
CannTrust Holdings
CannTrust Q4 earnings report  released on March 28  pressured the stock  which dropped 22 7 percent afterward  It closed last Friday at  7 76 

CannTrust reported a 132  jump in revenues  compared with the same period the previous year  But it also recorded a net loss of  25 5 million for the period  That translated into a loss of 26 cents per share compared with the  6 3 million profit or 8 cents a share it showed in Q4 2017  Analysts were disappointed  having expected to see a 4 cent per share loss 
Among the Q4 2018 highlights  the Ontario based company graduated to a TSX Composite listing and began trading in the U S  In addition  CannTrust obtained all necessary permits to continue to expand its indoor growing facilities and secured 200 acres of land on which to develop an outdoor growing operation  The company operates a 430 000 square foot greenhouse in the Niagara region  one of the largest in North America 
CannTrust also signed a major partnership with Breakthru Beverage Group  Canada s largest alcoholic beverage broker  which operates in the wine and beer sector 
Bottom line for cannabis companies  they re moving quickly on a variety of fronts  While continuing to ramp up production and fill the pipelines for what has already been legalized  they re also looking ahead at the potential in additional areas such as edibles 
Overall  it s a market that s expected to potentially bring in billions of dollars in profits  And the longer the U S  refrains from legalizing the substance  the more attractive Canadian companies become for major U S  players looking to position themselves within the space  As long as the U S  doesn t legalize the substance at the federal level  the size and scope of this window of opportunity for Canadian players is wide open ",2019-04-01,Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tilray-cronos-canntrust-200402607,200402607
199010,420526,MO,3 Under The Radar Tobacco Stocks With Strong Upside Potential,opinion,"Many investors have written off the tobacco industry  Smoking rates are declining and the popularity of ethical investing continues to escalate 
But opting out of this still viable sector would be premature  New growth opportunities in areas like vaping and cannabis have fundamentally changed the investment thesis  Indeed  the ARCA Tobacco Index has soared 40 8  so far this year  significantly outperforming the broader market 

We ve been watching three tobacco stocks that continue to have strong upside potential  One is a tobacco leaf specialist making a big bet on cannabis  the second is an up and coming name in the vaping industry  and the third is a cigarette giant currently trying to diversify its offerings 
1  Pyxus International  From Tobacco Leaf To Cannabis
Pyxus International  NYSE PYX   formerly Alliance One International  is engaged in purchasing  processing  storing and selling leaf tobacco used in international brand cigarettes  The company generates revenue primarily by selling raw tobacco leaf along with the relevant processing fees charged from tobacco manufacturers worldwide 
In an effort to diversify  the company announced in February that it is entering the U S  industrial hemp industry and taking controlling stakes in two privately held Canadian cannabis companies  Canada s Island Garden  a licensed producer  and Goldleaf Pharm  an applicant to produce and sell medicinal cannabis  Pyxus issued a press release on Feb  8 detailing the acquisitions  including its 75  equity stake in Canada s Island Garden and 80  stake in GoldLeaf Pharm 
It also made an investment in a North Carolina based company  Criticality  acquiring a 40  stake with the ability to increase that to 50  after March 31  2020  Criticality is part of a state pilot program whose purpose is to extract cannabidiol  CBD  from industrial hemp  with a five year goal of becoming a leader in CBD production and consumer products 

Pyxus  which has a market capitalization of approximately  227 million and has generated  1 2 billion year to date sales through the first three quarters of its 2018 fiscal year  has seen its stock surge 110  since the start of 2019  It ended Tuesday s session at  25 00 
Despite the strong start to the year  we continue to expect significant upside from here  The company is well positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in the cannabis and CBD industries 
2  Turning Point Brands  Vaping Specialist
Turning Point Brands  NYSE TPB  aims to be the leader in next generation tobacco products as well as the vape market  It has three product categories  Smokeless Products such as chewing tobacco  Smoking Products such as Zig Zag cigarette paper  and NewGen  which markets vapor products under brand names such as Vaporfi  Vapor Beast  VaporSupply and VaporShark 
Though Juul of which Altria has a 35  stake is the big mover and shaker in the space  Turning Point Brands looks like an attractive vaping play as well  Fourth quarter sales grew 28   driven by 86  growth in NewGen s vaping devices and liquids division  which accounted for 47  of sales in the quarter 
Last fall  Turning Point Brands invested in a privately held Canadian American Standard Hemp  CASH   which converts hemp into CBD liquids  capsules  vape cartridges  and sprays   Our partnership with CASH is already providing quick dividends   TPB s CEO Larry Wexler said in the fourth quarter conference call 
 We are now launching our own set of proprietary products to expand our sales footprint in the fast growing CBD market   he added  Those are sold under its Nu X brand 

Turning Point s stock  which closed at  46 00 last night  has gained roughly 69  so far this year  Year to date  shares are up 139  
We believe the company is in prime position to become a leading name in the vaping industry  making it a promising bet going forward 
3  Altria  From Cigarettes To Vaping To Weed
Altria Group  NYSE MO  is one of the world s largest producers and marketers of tobacco  cigarettes and related products  It controls the rights to Marlboro in the U S   where the brand has 40  of the market 
However  with smoking on the decline in the U S   Altria projects 4  5  annual volume depreciation for this year through 2023  As a result  the company has been making moves to diversify away from its core tobacco business with investments in vaping  cannabis and alcohol 
In December  Altria took a 35  stake in Juul  which surpassed  1 billion in sales last year compared to just  200 million in 2017  Altria CEO Howard Willard expects e vapor sales to grow at a 15  20  compound annual rate  by volume  through 2023 
Altria also made a play to enter the marijuana space  when it invested  1 8 billion in Canadian marijuana cultivator Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON   Altria has a 45  stake  with an option to increase that to 55   In addition  Altria has a 10  stake in Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE BUD  

Altria shares  which ended at  56 69 yesterday  are up 14 7  in 2019  We see more upside in the months ahead as the company positions itself as a diversified play across the tobacco  vaping and cannabis spaces ",2019-04-03,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-undertheradar-tobacco-stocks-200403360,200403360

199020,420536,MO,Altria  BCE  Quality Dividend Stocks Likely To Rally Strongly In 2019,opinion,"With the U S  Federal Reserve skewing more dovish and the risks to economic growth still elevated  2019 is shaping up to be a year where owning some quality dividend stocks could be the right move for just about any portfolio  We believe dividend stocks will rally strongly in 2019 now that the Fed has held its benchmark interest rate steady as of its January 30 meeting 
The central bank s path to slower interest rate hikes delivers a clear signal to investors that bond yields  which compete directly with dividend paying stocks  won t be rising as quickly as was earlier expected 
Both futures and bond markets have already adjusted to this reality  Futures markets are now pricing in a strong probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in 2019  The five year Treasury note now yields about 2 44  down from more than 3  in November which makes the higher yields on many dividend stocks attractive by comparison 
Any short term capital risk inherent in buying high quality dividend stocks is offset by the logic of betting on dividend payers that have a history of producing solid income for investors via a rising stock price driven by solid earnings and reliable dividend increases  Here are two examples we like 
1  Altria Group
Altria s  NYSE MO  6 50  dividend yield is unquestionably attractive  The parent company of Philip Morris USA  with high profile brands such as Marlboro  Skoal and Nat Sherman  cigarette maker Altria whose shares closed at  48 84 on Friday has seen its stock lose about 40  of value since the summer of 2017 as new government regulations and declining adult consumption of traditional tobacco products damaged the company s growth potential 

We believe that steep decline should reverse soon  Our optimism that Altria s shares have bottomed stems from the company s recent aggressive moves to diversify its revenue base 
In December  Altria invested  12 8 billion in Juul  acquiring a 35  stake in the e cigarette maker that has captured 75  of its alternative smoking segment in just three years  Prior to the Juul deal  in early December  Altria paid  1 8 billion for a 45  stake in Canadian cannabis company  Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON   one of the nation s largest marijuana producers  with a footprint in many countries and increasing production capabilities 
Along with its existing 10  stake in Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE BUD   the largest beer producer in the world  and now sizeable positions in both Juul and Cronos  Altria is a good long term bet  especially when its dividend yield is at a multiyear high  Over the past decade  Altria has consistently delivered high single digit percentage hikes to its quarterly payout  The company now pays  3 20 a share annually  a sum that has grown every year during the past 49 years 
2  BCE Inc 
If sin stocks don t fit your investing criteria  Canada s largest telecom operator  BCE  NYSE BCE  may be a more attractive option with which to build a growing fixed income stream 
Due to a limited number of competitors and strong demand from its expanding immigrant population  Canada s telecom market has been a lucrative space for dividend stock investors 

BCE s dominant market position  huge investment in new technologies and a juicy 5 22  annual dividend yield make it an attractive stock for buy and hold investors  Shares  which closed at  43 23 on Friday  gained 10  this year after underperforming the broader market during 2018 
That momentum should continue  especially this year when the Bank of Canada is signalling a cautious approach to its interest rate policy after multiples hikes in 2018  Over the past decade  BCE has doubled its dividend payout  which is currently  2 27 a share per annum  proving the company s ability to generate steady dividend income for its loyal investors 
Bottom Line
Dividend stock investing is an established way to earn regular income  In order to be effective  an investor basically looks for companies that can produce expanding cash flows  while also maintaining durable competitive advantages within their industries  Both Altria and BCE meet those criteria ",2019-02-11,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-bce-200386123,200386123
199021,420537,MO,Should You Invest In Marijuana ,opinion,"It s an exciting time for investors in the new marijuana industry who are now able to purchase shares in companies producing cannabis products for the consumer and medical markets for the first time ever  It has also been somewhat frustrating however  because those investment choices are currently limited by an inconsistent patchwork of laws 
Major US stock exchanges   quite sensibly   will decline to list any companies who are engaged in illegal activity  and since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level in the US  that means no companies who deal directly with marijuana inside the country are traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ 
Currently  the marijuana companies an investor can purchase on those exchanges either operate only in other countries where marijuana is completely legal   most notably Canada   or are US companies that provide ancillary services to the marijuana industry but don t handle the products themselves 
Many more companies are now operating in a legal grey area in which they are virtually certain of their immunity from criminal prosecution because they are following the laws of the state s  in which they do business  yet cannot use traditional banking and credit card services or deduct many expenses when calculating taxes owed  and also cannot list their shares on the major exchanges 
If marijuana becomes broadly legal at the federal level in the US  there is likely to be a deluge of investment opportunities as a new crop of surprisingly sophisticated new companies seek to raise capital on major exchanges 
 
Continue reading      
                                                                                                      

Legalized marijuana  with almost unimaginable profit potential  has swept over all of Canada  down through 33 states plus D C  This brand new industry is booming from  9 billion in 2017 to an expected  32 billion by 2020  It could soar above  146 billion by 2025 
Stock gains like 43 7  in 2 weeks and  856 1  in 2 months are already being generated  Not since the Repeal of Prohibition in 1933 has there been such a release of pent up demand 
How can you take advantage 

                                                                                                      
With regard to legalization  public opinion has been changing rapidly  with the latest Pew research poll showing 62  of Americans currently favoring it at the Federal level  Those results show some significant differences of opinion based on age and political affiliation  with younger and more politically liberal respondents much more likely to support legalization than those who are older and or more politically conservative 
In addition to recent scientific research that suggests that Marijuana is less harmful to users  health than other drugs   including alcohol and cigarettes   proponents of legalization also see a potential tax windfall to be gained in the regulation and taxation of Marijuana products 
Estimates abound about the potential size of the legal marijuana market ranging from very conservative to wildly exaggerated   including some numbers in the trillions  Careful research estimates that the US market will grow from the  9B that was spent on legal marijuana in 2017 to  32B by 2020  With state and local taxes of up to 25  in many municipalities where recreational sales are legal  it s only natural that states and towns see marijuana sales as a way to shore up strained budgets 
The state of Colorado collected  68 million in taxes on legal marijuana sales in 2014 and that number has steadily increased to  267 million in 2018  The state will pass the  1B mark in total tax revenues early in 2019 
There is also a criminal justice reform aspect to legalization  Minorities have been disproportionately incarcerated for non violent marijuana crimes compared to Caucasians  despite evidence that usage rates are similar 
Personal Beliefs vs Investment Opportunity
As the Pew Research polls demonstrate  a significant number of Americans remain uncomfortable with the recent pace of change in efforts to legalize marijuana  That s a perfectly rational position and it s understandable that investors who share this sentiment might be hesitant to buy the shares of companies who sell marijuana 
Keep in mind however that with a combined  232B in market cap  Phillip Morris International  PM  and Altria  NYSE MO  are owned by millions of Americans  either directly or as a component of ETF and mutual funds   even if those investors personally disapprove of cigarettes 
If you ve read this far  there s a good chance you can see that there are going to be some really exciting investment opportunities in the marijuana industry 
Let s take a quick look at how politics and the legislative process might affect the industry 
Is Marijuana Legal 
That s no longer an easy question to answer 
In terms of federal law  the answer is  no   Marijuana remains illegal in the US and is classified as a Schedule 1 drug  The DEA and the Justice Department continue to investigate and prosecute those who violate federal law with regard to marijuana 
 More on drug scheduling in Zacks  Weekend Wisdom in a few days  
At the state and municipal level  the water is much murkier  Thirty three states allow the cultivation  sale  possession and or use of marijuana for medicinal purposes  and ten States and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for recreational purposes 
Drilling down even lower  in states where marijuana is legal  counties and cities have generally been empowered to enact their own rules that are more strict than the applicable state law  The result is the patchwork regulatory quilt that means that there are spots in the country where a retail store might sell marijuana products legally  while the same business would be prohibited from operating directly across the street in a different municipality 
Former Attorney General Eric Holder made it clear that the Justice Department would respect the laws of the individual states and that there would be no federal prosecutions of marijuana crimes as long as the behavior was legal under state law  President Trump s first AG  Jeff Sessions  initially promised to take a much stricter stance on marijuana than the previous administration   but nothing of any significance happened in terms of federal marijuana law enforcement during his tenure  and his departure left that situation unclear 
Momentum Toward Legalization
During confirmation hearings  President Trump s new Attorney General  William Barr  stated that his position on marijuana was similar to Holder s   that the Justice Department would not prosecute any marijuana crimes for behavior that was legal under applicable state laws  He went on to clarify that although he is not personally in favor of legalization  he believes that current state actions amount to a  backdoor nullification of federal law   and stated his preference that Congress act to clarify the legal situation 
There is currently a bill before the new congress   H R  420   that would provide for the regulation of marijuana products at the federal level  There now seems to be significant momentum toward federal legalization for recreational use  The governors of New York and New Jersey are currently advocating for the legalization of marijuana in their states and the recently elected governors of Illinois  Minnesota  Connecticut and New Mexico campaigned on promises of legalization 
Many of the likely candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination including Elizabeth Warren  Kirsten Gillibrand  Corey Booker  Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar all support legalization  and it s not a stretch to speculate that President Trump might also embrace the legalization cause as a way to connect with moderate voters in his bid for re election  Leaked reports from the White House actually suggest that Trump considered Sessions  position on marijuana to be antiquated   privately comparing his own Attorney General s statements to  something my Grandpa would say  
The pace of change we see in the coming months and years will likely be rapid 
How Can You Profit from the Politics of Pot 
Future legislation about the legal status of marijuana in the US will almost certainly have a profound impact on the fortunes of the companies in the industry and on the returns of investors 
Investing responsibly in the marijuana space will involve staying abreast of pending developments in legalization   from what s going to be included in referendums on state ballots  all the way to what s happening on the floors of Congress and the Oval Office 
Those who see the potential in this nascent industry would be wise to pay close attention to the politics of pot as they make their investment decisions  Some of the early big gains  and losses  may well be due as much to the results of the political process as to the individual efforts of the companies involved 
A Good Way to Keep Up
At Zacks we re monitoring political developments very closely as well as tracking individual stocks 
As I mentioned earlier  this space is skyrocketing from  9 billion in 2017 to an expected  32 billion within the next 2 years  Yet only a few growers  pharmaceuticals  financial firms  suppliers   both established and start ups   are the true innovators and offer exceptional profit potential 
So if you don t want to devote the constant attention and painstaking analysis to find these often little known stocks  we can find them for you 
You re invited to take part in the brand new portfolio service I m directing  
Our approach will be aggressive but responsible and vigilant  We ll pursue double and triple digit gains  alerting you what and when to buy and when to sell  I ll also brief you on market developments and on news that directly affects your investments 
Time to Get In
This is your chance to start your trial of Marijuana Innovators just as the industry is ramping up for maximum profit potential  In fact  I ve lined up the portfolio s first 3 trades and expect to post them soon after the market opens Monday 
But please note that the number of investors who take part will be restricted and the deadline is coming up fast  The portfolio closes to entry Sunday  March 3

199032,420548,MO,Cannabis Producer Stocks Continue Their Rally,opinion,"Increased investor confidence in the future of cannabis is helping shares in Canadian cannabis producers to sustain their rally  This is true of both the medicinal and recreational use markets  Additionally  the US s legalisation of hemp has opened up this market to a number of major Canadian producers who see significant changes in US legislation on the horizon 
There was even more good news for Cronos Group with industry heavyweight Altria Group  NYSE MO  investing  1 8 billion in the company in return for a 45  stake 
Short term market sentiment will be determined by the quarterly financial reports of Aurora Cannabis  TO ACB   Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON  and Tilray  NASDAQ TLRY   which are to be published within the next few weeks  Investors will be expecting these producers to report sharp sales growth as a result of the recent increase in market outlets  They will also want to hear about their respective 2019 strategies 
For these reasons  we can expect to see increased volatility in this sector and any remotely significant development could trigger a marked jump or abrupt drop in share prices 
Financial scouts are predicting unit share price rises for the major cannabis producers within the following ranges  Canopy Growth  CGC     50 50 5  Cronos Group  CRON   24 25  and Aphria Inc     11 12  Meanwhile  they expect shares in Aurora Cannabis to hit the  8 5 9 mark  with Tilray rising as high as  84 85

199059,420575,MO,With Its New Marijuana Deal  Is Cigarette Maker Altria Group Finally A Buy ,opinion,"After watching its market cap steadily erode over the past year and a half  Altria Group  NYSE MO   the owner of Marlboro cigarettes among other globally recognized tobacco brands  is at long last fighting back 

Last week  the parent company of Philip Morris USA  Skoal and Nat Sherman announced that it was paying  1 8 billion for a 45  stake in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group  NASDAQ CRON   The deal also allows the cigarette maker to acquire another 10  of the Toronto based Cronos  a move that would give Altria a controlling stake in the pot producer in its home country  which in October became the first developed nation to legalize marijuana for adult recreational use 
Even before its entry into the marijuana market  Altria was reported to be in talks for a minority stake in an e cigarette startup  Juul Labs Inc  Both moves appear to be part of a larger diversification strategy for this traditional tobacco company  a way to revive growth at a time when cigarette sales are declining and nicotine consumers are increasingly looking for other options in lieu of burning tobacco 
New Avenues For Growth
This aggressive  acquisition led growth strategy comes on the heels of steep declines in Altria shares  which closed yesterday at  53 95  Since the summer of 2017  Altria has lost more than a quarter of its market capitalization  as technological innovation  new government regulations and declining adult consumption of traditional tobacco products created doubts about the company s future growth potential 
Nearly 38 million  or 15 5   of American adults smoked traditional cigarettes in 2016  down from 20 9  in 2005  according to the US s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  This shift in tobacco consumption has also been bad news for long time Altria investors  who for years have loved the stock for its recession proof status and attractive dividends 
Indeed  during the past decade  Altria shares have outperformed the benchmark S P 500 by a wide margin  providing stakeholders with annualized returns of about 20   through January 2018  However  since the start of the year that advantage has been shrinking rapidly  forcing management to seek new avenues for growth 
In our view  Altria s entry into the fast growing cannabis market and its potential stake in Juul  which accounted for about three quarters of the US e cigarette market  are two smart moves that will position the company to capture significant positions in each of these fast growing markets 
Cronos Group  currently Canada s number 6 pot producer  with its footprint in many countries and increasing production capabilities  has everything needed to become a strong global player in the marijuana space  The company is on track to grow 117 000 kilograms of cannabis per year  after the producer secured key supply agreements for the recreational marijuana market in Canada 
In addition  Cronos has partnered with pharmaceutical supplier Pohl Boskamp to distribute medical cannabis products in Germany  It has also finalized another medical marijuana supply agreement in Poland  As well  the company has joint ventures in Australia  Israel  and Latin America 
Juul could prove to be a good investment for Altria too  as the start up seeks to expand its e cigarette business beyond the US where it s facing significant regulatory hurdles  Juul products are sold in Canada  the UK  Israel and Russia  the company has expansion plans in Europe and Asia as well 
Despite the recent positive headlines  investors have generally given Altria s stock the cold shoulder  The primary reason  the FDA s announcement last month that in addition to restricting e cigarette sales it would seek to ban menthol cigarettes  Menthols represent about 20  of Altria s cigarette sales 
Bottom Line
For the past few years  the negative headwinds hitting the tobacco industry have been accelerating  Not surprising then that it hasn t been a good time to invest in cigarette producers  But if you re looking for regular income and long term value from this sector  we believe Altria is the best option 
The company is fortifying its diversified business model which will help maintain earnings growth  With its 10  stake in Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE BUD   the largest beer producer in the world  and a now sizeable position in the accelerating marijuana industry  Altria is a good long term bet  especially when its dividend yield  at 6   is at a multiyear high ",2018-12-12,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/altria-group-a-buy-after-marijuana-deal-200367241,200367241

199067,420583,MO,Juul Burns Out  Company Ends Sales   Social Media Promotions ,opinion,"It was a long time coming  but the  15 billion startup that had 70  market share of the e cig industry has faced the consequences  Earlier this year  Juul Labs had been facing a lot of backlash from the public  the government and the Food and Drug Administration as they were targeting the wrong demographic through their social media and selling their products to underage consumers  After facing lawsuits and complaints from other companies and children s parents  Juul has decided to stop selling their e cig flavors in stores and halting social media promotions 
It s What We Expected
The company decided to go through with this decision as the FDA recently announced their plan to ban all sales of flavored e cigs  CEO Kevin Burns stated that it was never their intention to have youth use Juul  However  even if it wasn t their intention  as they claim  the company still used young people in their promotional and social media campaigns  So even if they weren t targeting that demographic directly  they did so indirectly  According to the   the FDA acknowledged that it was caught off guard when they came across the soaring popularity of vaping among minors  It has been reported that more than three million middle and high school students use e cigarettes 
The main idea behind Juul was that it was meant to be for adult smokers looking to find an alternative to cigarettes with nicotine   Since the company s objective has taken a wrong turn  other tobacco e cig companies have had to face consequences as well  The FDA had met with many different e cig and tobacco companies to find alternatives to reduce youth vaping after threatening that it would take e cigarettes off the market if these companies didn t find a way to end teenage sales 
Major companies like Altria   NYSE MO   said that they would discontinue most of its flavored e cigs as well as support a law raising the age to 21 to purchase tobacco and vaping products  something they had denied before  The company also agreed to use age verification technology  Hopefully  this will ensure anyone buying these flavors online meet the age requirement and that the technology is strict enough to figure that out 
Impact on Sales  
In a study by Ernst   Young  consumers have been demanding more variety in flavors for e cigs  The most popular flavors include fruits  23   and botanicals  20    However  since these kinds of flavors won t be sold anymore  does this mean sales will decrease  The company has mentioned that it will end sales for flavors like cucumber  mango and cream  just to name a few  but will still sell menthol  mint and tobacco flavors as those are still available in regular tobacco cigarettes 
According to   over a 52 week period ending July 14  2018  the company had over  1 billion in profit  so imagine what it would be like since the company s launch in 2015  It can be expected that since the company will no longer be selling in stores  the place where people prefer to buy their products  according to the EY report  the company might face a decline in sales  Juul has been a very profitable company  even from the start  However  since their operations seemed somewhat unethical  it is important to understand that the company faced the right consequence at the right time 
We can look at this both ways  Sales might decrease  but since the company will still sell online  consumers could still buy the flavors online  regardless of the age verification system 
Bottom Line
Before we consider the financial aspects of this situation  it is important to consider the guidelines the FDA has set out to ensure safety for the people using this product  Considering this a huge hit for the company itself  the e cig industry might be facing some trouble too  seeing as many other major companies don t want to face the same problems after the FDA has set out specific strict guidelines 
It will be interesting to look at how these companies  especially Juul  will perform in the upcoming months  and whether or not they will be valued at the same amount as they were when they first started

199068,420584,MO,Tobacco Breaks Bull Trends In Reaction To Potential Restrictions,opinion,"It s amazing how big an effect one remark can have on society  Last week  after a senior FDA representative commented about potential restrictions on menthol in cigarettes  the market saw a mass sell off of big tobacco stocks  While the action taken is based merely on speculation  that speculation is based in fact  The FDA has long since been emphasizing the risk posed by menthol based cigarettes  especially towards children who are more likely to choose that type of cigarette 
A whole month s worth of profit went down the tubes in just two days for Altria Group  NYSE  NYSE MO   Tuesday  in the early hours of the trading day  we saw shares break under the weight of a bullish support line that has been going since May of 2018 
It was even worse for British American Tobacco  LON BATS   NYSE BTI   the makers of the popular menthol cigarette Newport  By the closing bell on Monday their valuation had decreased by a staggering  11 Billion 
Their larger fall can be attributed to their larger interest in the menthol market  Menthol only makes up 20  of Marlboro s profit  while British American Tobacco s is greater still 
 BAT is the most exposed name to the potential risk   wrote Richard Taylor  an analyst with Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   He estimates that menthol products account for over 25  of BAT earnings 
Western Civilization Is Moving On From Cigarettes
The numbers are clear and they don t lie  Fewer and fewer new smokers are emerging  with an increasing number of existing smokers quitting  This is a trend that spans all age groups but the constant campaigning regarding the dangers of smoking have been especially effective with the young 
With public opinion shifting from an inclusive to exclusive when it comes to smoking  both European and American governments are flexing their muscles  Rather than just taxing the products  they are going so far as to consider banning them altogether 
In a press release that occurred May of this year  the European Commission unveiled several new initiatives like the Tobacco Advertising Directive  and Tobacco Products Directive  These initiatives place greater restrictions on the sale of tobacco as well as the advertising of it  The EU has also initiated a  track and trace  system which protects against illegal tobacco trade 
These restrictions are strict  but they have nothing on the hammer about to drop in 2020  an outright ban of all menthol cigarettes in the EU 
Policy shifts like the ones coming from Europ have Big Tobacco companies worried over the future of the U S  market and how it will be effected  With the EU setting a precedent and public opinion swayed in a less smoking friendly direction  it s easy to see the winds might shift the EU s way in America as well  Even if we don t make as drastic a policy change  the FDA s new restrictions on menthol will still have a major impact on sales  All this is just based on rumors created by a FDA official s side comment  but with those rumors substantiated by current market trends  they are rumors we cannot ignore 
Tobacco moves East and South  Using New Markets to stay Relevant
It s hardly a surprise for big tobacco companies that western countries are reducing their use of tobacco products  The writing has been on the wall for years  Because of that  they are moving their efforts East  to less developed countries with fewer restrictions and less education on the dangers of smoking 
Tobaccofreekids org compiled a recent report that observes a radical shift in the average market when it comes to tobacco users  Now  nearly 80  of smokers are low to middle income households in both Europe and America 

 Sales are shifting from developed markets  like those in Western Europe  where smoking prevalence is declining and where tobacco company operations are more restricted by government policies  to emerging markets  like those in Asia and Africa  where tobacco companies take full advantage of lax regulatory environments  growing populations and increasing incomes 

So long as big tobacco companies are able to offset their losses with profits in less educated parts of the world  their share prices will stabilize 
Someday soon the day may come when even the less educated nations become aware of the dangers of smoking  and the burdens it places on their healthcare system and force the product out of their lives  The most important market to watch for  though  is the Chinese one  As of right now  China is the largest buyer of tobacco products worldwide  so their stance will have great effect on the market in the years to come 
Should the Chinese begin to shy away from smoking  the whole market could go up in smoke ",2018-11-14,Bill Poulos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-trends-are-broken-by-tobacco-in-reaction-to-potential-menthol-restrictions-200359238,200359238
199069,420585,MO,Why Cannabis Stocks CRON   APHA Are Moving In Opposite Directions,opinion,"Shares of Cronos Group   NASDAQ CRON   and Aphria   TO APHA   extended their recent moves in opposite directions on Tuesday morning  as investors continued to digest major headlines related to the popular cannabis companies 
Cronos shares  which added more than 11  on Monday  were up another 4  in early morning trading today after the company confirmed it has been in talks with tobacco giant Altria   NYSE MO   about a potential investment  Reports revealing these discussions first surfaced yesterday 
An investment or takeover from Altria could be exciting news for Cronos investors and the broader marijuana industry  Canadian legalization and listings on U S  exchanges  among other factors  have helped cannabis become an exciting new investing segment  but there is still a sense of uncertainty that involvement from an established leader like Altria might help solve 
Still  any potential deal  Cronos said in a statement today  is far from guaranteed 
 No agreement has been reached with respect to any such transaction and there can be no assurance such discussions will lead to an investment or other transaction involving the companies   wrote Cronos Group 
Meanwhile  Aphria shares fell more than 20  on Tuesday morning  extending volatility which saw the stock lose almost 28  in the previous session  Aphria has been battered by a short seller s accusation that a recent deal to buy LATAM Holdings  a Columbia based medical cannabis producer  was  largely worthless  and served only to benefit insiders 
According to Quintessential Capital Management s   Aphria used cash from dilutive share issuances to purchase LATAM at an over priced valuation  effectively diverting millions of dollars  from shareholders into their own pockets  
Aphria steadfastly denied the allegations on Monday morning  In a   Aphria called the report a  malicious and self serving attempt  to manipulate its stock price   
As for the LATAM acquisition  Aphria said that its board of directors  received financial advice and a fairness opinion from a reputable firm that the consideration to be offered by Aphria in respect of the transaction was fair  from a financial point of view  to Aphria and its shareholders  
The drama underscores the aforementioned uncertainty of today s cannabis business and has dragged Aphria shares lower  while many of its industry peers have surged on the hopes of major M A deals

199071,420587,MO,FDA to ban flavored e cigarettes at U S  convenience stores,news,"By Chris Kirkham  Reuters    The U S  Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced sweeping new restrictions on flavored tobacco products  including electronic cigarettes popular among teenagers in an effort to prevent a new generation of nicotine addicts  The much anticipated announcement will mean that only tobacco  mint and menthol e cigarette flavors can be sold at most traditional retail outlets such as convenience stores  Other fruity  or sweet flavored varieties can now only be sold at age restricted stores or through online merchants that use age verification checks  The FDA also plans to seek a ban on menthol cigarettes  a longtime goal of public health advocates  as well as flavored cigars  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the moves are meant to prevent young people from continuing to use e cigarettes  potentially leading to traditional cigarette smoking   I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e cigarettes   Gottlieb said  The agency has faced mounting pressure to act on e cigarettes amid their surging popularity among U S  teenagers in recent years  One of the most popular devices  made by San Francisco based Juul Labs Inc  has become a phenomenon at U S  high schools  where  Juuling  has become synonymous with vaping  E cigarettes vaporize a liquid containing nicotine  the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush  They are widely believe to be less harmful than combustible cigarettes  but the long term health consequences of using the devices are unknown  Data released on Thursday by the FDA and the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a 78 percent increase in high school students who reported using e cigarettes in the last 30 days  compared with the prior year  More than 3 million high school students  or more than 20 percent of all U S  high school students  used the products  along with 570 000 middle school students  according to the survey   SUPPORT TO RESTRICT YOUTH ACCESS  Juul and tobacco giant  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc had announced measures to pull flavored e cigarette products from retail outlets  after the FDA threatened in September to ban Juul and other leading e cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors  Juul  Logic  a unit of Japan Tobacco Inc  Altria  which makes e cigarettes under the MarkTen brand   British American Tobacco   LON BATS  Plc  BAT  and Imperial Brands  LON IMB  Plc  the maker of blu e cigarettes  all said they supported efforts to reduce youth access  Altria said it believes the devices have the potential to be  less harmful products that can deliver nicotine to adults who want them   Imperial said it was developing a technology that can lock the devices if an underage person tries to use it   BAT said that while  flavors play an important role in an adult smoker s transition out of smoking  we understand the FDA s concern that some flavors can play a role in increasing youth appeal    E cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community  Some focus on the potential benefit of shifting lifelong smokers to less harmful nicotine products  while others fear it will create a new generation addicted to nicotine  Last year the FDA under Gottlieb extended until 2022 a deadline for many e cigarette products to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health  Today s restrictions on flavors are interim measures that companies must follow before submitting detailed plans before the deadline  The new rules on e cigarette flavors mean that many of the sweet and fruity varieties believed to be most popular among minors will only be available in stores such as vape shops or tobacco shops that do not allow under age people inside  Stores could also have a separate  age restricted section that allows sale of other flavors  the FDA said  FIERCE RESISTANCE TO MENTHOL BAN The agency cited survey data showing that mint and menthol flavors were more popular with adult e cigarette users than teenagers   Anti tobacco and public health groups commended the FDA on its proposed ban on menthol cigarettes  which data show are far more popular among young smokers and particularly young African Americans  Any move to ban menthol is expected to face fierce resistance from the tobacco industry   Menthol cigarettes represent more than 30 percent of U S  cigarette volumes and approximately 55 percent of BAT s U S  volumes  through its Newport brand  according to a research note from AllianceBernstein earlier this week  The FDA must go through a rulemaking process  which requires significant public comment before finalizing any regulation on menthols  
Imperial  BAT and Altria said the ban on menthols or flavored cigars was not supported by science and evidence ",2018-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fda-will-ban-flavored-ecigarettes-at-us-convenience-stores-1690014,1690014
199072,420588,MO,Altria in talks to take minority stake in Juul  sources,news,"By Harry Brumpton and Chris Kirkham  Reuters    Tobacco company  Altria Group  Inc  N MO  is in talks to take a minority stake of 20 to 40 percent in e cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc  people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday  The companies declined to comment  Big tobacco companies  including Marlboro maker Altria  have been investing in e cigarettes as U S  smoking rates decline  but those products have lost significant market share over the last year as Juul s popularity has surged  The talks have been ongoing over the last few months  and the size of the stake could change  the sources said  The talks could still fall apart because of the many shareholders and regulators involved  one source said  Such a deal could allow Juul to continue to grow with reduced risk  the people said  without losing control of the company  Privately held Juul s vaping devices  which resemble a USB flash drive  have helped the company quickly become the market leader in the U S  e cigarette business  growing from 13 6 percent of the market in early 2017 to more than 75 percent this month  according to a  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysis of Nielsen retail data  Juul s sleek design and sweet flavors  including mango and creme  made it particularly popular among high schoolers   Juuling  has become synonymous with vaping  with young people posting videos and photos of themselves using the product at school or with friends  often under the hashtags  doit4juul or  juullife  Juul s e liquid also has a much higher nicotine content than earlier versions of U S  e cigarettes  The company says its products are meant only for adults looking to convert from traditional cigarettes  Earlier this month  the U S  Food and Drug Administration announced new curbs on sales of flavored tobacco products  including Juul s mango and cool cucumber  to age restricted stores and online merchants that use age verification checks  But Juul  launched in 2015  was valued at more than  16 billion based on a July 2018 funding round  according to venture capital database PitchBook Data Inc  Early Juul investors included Tao Capital Partners  headed in part by Nicholas Pritzker  who formerly ran the Hyatt hotel empire  Other investors include Fidelity Investments Inc and Tiger Global Management  according to PitchBook   Altria has invested in the e cigarette sector in recent years through its Nu Mark subsidiary  which sells devices such as the MarkTen e cigarettes in convenience stores and tobacco shops across the country  In 2014 Altria acquired e cigarette startup GreenSmoke Inc for  110 million  Altria s products  however  have lost significant ground to Juul over the last year  as have e cigarette brands from other major tobacco companies  The market share of  British American Tobacco  Plc  L BATS   which sells Vuse e cigarettes  fell from 21 4 percent of U S  e cigarette sales in February to 9 6 percent this month  while Altria s share fell from 11 1 percent to 4 4 percent over the same period  according to the Nielsen data  Any potential investment in Juul carries its own set of risks  San Francisco based Juul has faced heightened pressure from U S  regulators as the growing popularity of flavored e cigarettes among teenagers has sparked fears of a new generation of nicotine addicts  Federal data released earlier this month showed a 78 percent increase in high school students who reported using e cigarettes in the last 30 days  compared with the prior year  coinciding with the rise in Juul s popularity   Altria s shares have fallen by more than 20 percent over the year as cigarette smoking continues to decline in the United States  Federal data from earlier this month showed cigarette smoking among U S  adults reached an estimated 14 percent in 2017  the lowest level ever  Altria s shares rose 1 percent to  55 55 after the bell on Wednesday

199079,420595,MO,Why Is Altria  MO  Up 2  Since Its Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO    Shares have added about 2  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is MO due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Altria Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Rise Y YAltria came out with first quarter 2018 results that showed consistent strength in the bottom line  The quarterly performance also reflected improved revenues in the smokeless category  Nevertheless  lower cigarette volumes remained a drag Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 95 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents  Earnings also surged 30 1  year over year on the back of greater equity earnings from the company s beer investments related to AB InBev  higher adjusted operating companies income   OCI   in the smokeless segments  lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate  These positives were partially offset by reduced adjusted OCI in the smokeable unit Net revenues of the company inched up 0 4  year over year to  6 1 billion  driven by higher revenues in the smokeless segment  largely offset by a drop in the smokeable category  Revenues net of excise taxes improved 1 8  to  4 7 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was  4 6 million Also  in the said period  gross profit improved 5 8  from the prior year quarter to  2 936 million Segment DetailsSmokeable  Products Segment  Net revenues in the category dropped 0 8  year over year to  5 414 million  thanks to lower volumes and increased promotional spending  These were mostly offset by higher pricing  Revenues net of excise taxes gained 0 4  year over year to  4 013 million Total shipment volume in the category fell 4 1  from the prior year quarter  Also  domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 4 2  year over year owing to lower cigarette industry volumes and decline in retail share  This was partially compensated by favorable trade inventory movements The company has been witnessing declining cigarette volumes for a while now due to stringent government regulations and increased consumer awareness regarding the negative impact of tobacco Total cigarette retail share declined to 50 3   representing a 0 7 percentage point slip  This was primarily due to a 0 5 share point drop in Marlboro s retail share owing to an increase in cigarette excise tax in California Adjusted OCI for the segment declined 2  to  1 995 million due to lower cigarette volumes  strategic investments and higher resolution expenses  These were partially made up for by higher pricing  Additionally  adjusted OCI margins declined 1 2 percentage points to 49 7  Smokeless Products  Net revenues in the segment rose 12 7  from the year ago figure to  525 million owing to voluntary recalls made in 2017 and improved pricing  Also  revenues net of excise taxes advanced 13 1  to  493 million in the quarter Domestic shipment volumes in the category dipped 0 1  to 195 7 million units  mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes  partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes  However  total smokeless products retail share gained 0 1 percentage points to 53 8  in the quarter Adjusted OCI surged 27 3  to  340 million due to voluntary recalls and higher pricing   Further  adjusted OCI margin expanded 7 8 percentage points to 69  Wine  Net revenues in the wine category increased 1 4  year over year to  142 million  driven by greater shipment volumes  partially countered by unfavorable mix  The segment s revenues  net of excise taxes  inched up 0 7  to  137 million  Wine shipment volume improved 6 1  to 1 8 million cases However  adjusted OCI dropped 19  to  17 million as a result of employee bonuses  partially countered by higher revenues  Adjusted OCI margin also contracted 3 percentage point to 12 4  Financial UpdatesAltria ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  2 191 million  long term debt of  13 033 million and total stockholders  equity of  15 397 million as of Mar 31  2018 With respect to dividends  during March 2018  Altria s board hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 6 1  to 70 cents per share  As a result  the company s annualized dividend rate is currently pegged at  2 80 per share  Further  management is on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80  of its bottom line During the first quarter  Altria paid dividends worth  1 3 billion  Further  the company repurchased 8 million shares for approximately  513 million in the quarter  As of Mar 31  2018  Altria had around  505 million remaining under its share repurchase program of  1 billion which is expected to be completed by 2018 end Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn October 2016  Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies  During the first quarter of 2018  the company completed these plans  Such consolidation is expected to provide annualized cost savings of  50 million by 2018 end OutlookFor 2018  management reiterated its earnings view and continues to expect adjusted earnings in the range of  3 90  4 03  up 15  to 19  year over year  This view excludes an expected charge of about 7 cents related to tax adjustments and certain special items  Further  the company continues to expect full year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 23 24

Zacks  style scores indicate that the company s stock is suitable for value and growth investors 
Outlook

199080,420596,MO,Should Value Investors Consider Altria  MO  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Altria Group  Inc    NYSE MO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Altria has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Altria s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Altria has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Altria stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Altria has a P S ratio of about 4 1  This is a bit higher than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Nevertheless  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  MO is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Altria currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Altria a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Altria is 1 6  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Altria might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives MO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and five downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Altria Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAltria is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 21   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-06-03,Zacks Investment

199081,420597,MO,Altria  Lighting Up 49 Years Of Dividend Increases,opinion,"When it comes to dividend stocks  investors usually have to choose between low yield stocks with high dividend growth  and stocks with high yields but low dividend growth  Only in rare instances does a company offer both a high dividend yield  and a high level of dividend growth each year 
Consumer products giant Altria Group  NYSE MO  is a rare high yield  dividend growth stock  Not only does Altria have a nearly 5  dividend yield  but the company has also raised its dividend 52 times in the past 49 years  Its high rate of dividend growth is due to its strong brands  competitive advantages  and excellent free cash flow 
Altria has the potential to deliver total returns in excess of 10  per year  with a high dividend yield and dividend increases each year  This is why Altria is a buy for income investors 
Tobacco  A Cash Cow
Altria is a diversified consumer products manufacturer  Its primary business segment is tobacco  where it operates the flagship Marlboro brand  as well as a number of smokeless tobacco brands like Skoal and Copenhagen  Altria also has a wine business and a 10  investment stake in beer giant Anheuser Busch Inbev  BR ABI   BUD   In all  Altria generates annual revenue of more than  25 billion 
Put simply  Altria is a free cash flow machine  Last year  Altria generated  4 9 billion of operating cash flow  and needed just  199 million for capital expenditures  Altria s high free cash flow is the result of tremendous competitive advantages and operational efficiencies  As a tobacco manufacturer  Altria operates in a highly regulated industry  Consider that tobacco companies are banned from advertising on television in the U S   which makes it incredibly hard for competitors to build brand power  In addition  Altria has a very lean manufacturing and distribution operation  and enjoys pricing power 
This has led to strong margin expansion and profit growth for Altria over the past five years 

Source  Annual Shareholder Meeting  page 6
Such strong economies of scale are why legendary investor Warren Buffett once professed his fondness for the tobacco business  The following Buffett quote summarizes the incredible economics of the tobacco industry 
 I ll tell you why I like the cigarette business  It cost a penny to make  Sell it for a dollar  It s addictive  And there s a fantastic brand loyalty  
The brand loyalty Buffett is referring to  is due entirely to Marlboro  the most valuable cigarette brand in the United States  Marlboro commands more than 40  of U S  retail market share  which gives Altria the ability to raise prices each year  For example  the average pack of Marlboros cost  6 79 last quarter  an increase of 2 3  from the same quarter the previous year 
Another benefit of Altria s business model is that it is highly consistent  Sales of tobacco and alcohol tend to hold up very well during recessions  This allows Altria to sail through economic downturns relatively unscathed  and continue to raise its dividend each year like clockwork 
Rolling Out New Products
Altria has increased its dividend 53 times in the past 49 years  It has increased its dividend twice in 2018  The most recent quarterly dividend was increased 21  from the same quarterly payout last year  This is a very high dividend growth rate for Altria  especially considering the stock has a high dividend yield of nearly 5  
Of course  future dividend increases will be reliant on the company s ability to grow earnings and cash flow  One potential risk for Altria is the declining rate of smoking in the United States  Altria s cigarette shipment volume declined by 5  last quarter  worse than the estimated industry decline of 4 5   While the company has diversified its product portfolio in recent years  tobacco still represents more than 80  of revenue and profits 
However  Altria continues to grow revenue and earnings  even in a difficult environment  In the most recent quarter  Altria s revenue net of excise taxes increased 3   while adjusted earnings per share increased 20  from the same quarter a year ago  Revenue growth came from price increases and higher sales  Earnings growth was attributable to revenue growth  as well as share repurchases and tax reform 
Altria has bet its future growth on new products  such as e vapor and heated tobacco 
The most important new innovation for Altria is the heated tobacco line IQOS  which heats tobacco rather than burns it  According to Altria  this offers consumers a  reduced risk  experience  as heating tobacco is expected to produce fewer adverse health effects than traditional cigarettes  Altria is awaiting regulatory approval from the Food   Drug Administration for IQOS  and is prepared for nationwide rollout upon approval 
Altria s brand power and product innovation should result in continued growth for the foreseeable future  Through earnings growth and dividends  Altria could generate strong shareholder returns over the next several years 
Lighting Up High Returns To Shareholders
At the midpoint of Altria s 2018 guidance  the company expects earnings per share of approximately  3 99  As a result  Altria stock trades for a price to earnings ratio of 16 5  In the past 10 years  Altria stock traded for an average price to earnings ratio of 16 2  This is a reasonable estimate of fair value for Altria  and therefore the stock is fairly valued 
As a result  Altria s future returns will be comprised of earnings growth and dividends  Altria is expected to grow earnings by 7  annually through 2023  which will add to its total returns  Lastly  dividends will contribute to shareholder returns  Altria has a high dividend yield of approximately 5   With a target dividend payout ratio of 80  of annual adjusted earnings  the company should have little trouble continuing to raise its dividend in the years ahead 
The combination of valuation changes  earnings growth  and dividends is expected to result in annual returns of 12  per year over the next five years  This is an attractive rate of return  especially for a relatively low risk dividend stock  particularly when compared with other high yielding dividend stocks  Altria has competitive advantages  strong brands  and the company should be expected to hold up well during a recession  It continues to increase its dividend each year  These qualities make Altria an attractive stock for income investors  such as retirees  looking to generate higher dividend income from their portfolios

199138,420654,MO,U S  cracks down on e cigarettes and cigars  bans sales to minors,news,"By Caroline Humer and Clarece Polke NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  government on Thursday took wide ranging steps to crack down for the first time on e cigarettes and cigars  growing in popularity among teens  and banned sales to anyone under age 18 in hopes of sparing a new generation from nicotine addiction  The Food and Drug Administration s action brought regulation of e cigarettes  cigars  pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco in line with existing rules for cigarettes  smokeless tobacco and roll your own tobacco  The new rules take effect in 90 days   The rules promise to have a major impact on the  3 4 billion e cigarette industry that has flourished in the absence of federal regulation  making the nicotine delivery devices the most commonly used tobacco products for U S  youngsters  The FDA said it will require companies to submit e cigarettes and other newer tobacco products for government approval  provide it with a list of their ingredients and place health warnings on packages and in advertisements   Health advocacy groups hailed the move  Industry officials said the regulations could hurt smaller companies and cripple a their job creating business due to the expense of the regulatory process  Wall Street analysts expect the regulations to herald a new wave of consolidation led by big tobacco companies  E cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that vaporize a fluid typically including nicotine and a flavor component  Using them is called  vaping   The FDA will require age verification by photo identification  ban sales from vending machines except in adults only locations and stop the distribution of free product samples  The new regulations had been highly anticipated after the agency issued a proposed rule two years ago on how to oversee the e cigarette industry and the other products   Millions of kids are being introduced to nicotine every year  a new generation hooked on a highly addictive chemical   U S  Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell told reporters  calling the rules a first step toward breaking the cycle of addiction  Burwell said health officials still do not have the scientific evidence showing e cigarettes can help smokers quit  as the industry asserts  and avoid the known ills of tobacco  The e cigarette vapor industry  which includes e cigarettes  vapors  personal vaporizers and tanks  is expected to have about  4 1 billion in sales in 2016   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  estimated in a recent research note   These new regulations create an enormously cost prohibitive regulatory process for manufacturers to market their products to adult smokers and vapers   said Cynthia Cabrera  president of the Smoke Free Alternatives Trade Association  representing the e cigarette industry  Three million U S  middle and high school students reported using e cigarettes in 2015  compared with 2 46 million in 2014  according to the most recent federal data   A University of Southern California study of high school students last year found that those who used e cigarettes were more than twice as likely to also smoke traditional cigarettes  While some researchers believe e cigarettes pose lower cancer risk because they do not burn tobacco  other researchers view e cigarette vapor as potentially harmful because of chemicals released during the burning process   This is a real epidemic and banning the sales of these products to minors  much like cigarettes  is a critical step to protecting their health now and into the future   said Democratic U S  Representative Lois Capps of California  Reynolds American Inc  N RAI   Imperial Brands Plc  L IMB  and  Altria Group  Inc  N MO  are among the largest makers of e cigarettes  Altria  which makes Marlboro cigarettes and e cigarettes  said it was concerned the regulations reached back to 2007 to determine which products to review  spokesman David Sutton said  Reynolds  which sells Newport and traditional cigarettes as well as Vuse e cigarettes  will discuss with the FDA how to establish a reasonable structure for review and approval  spokesman David Howard said  CONTROVERSY OVER FLAVORS Public health advocates also have urged the FDA to ban the use of flavored nicotine liquid in e cigarette and personal vaporizers  They contend the flavors  which can range from bacon to bubble gum  lure youngsters into taking up vaping  FDA officials said they would consider future regulation on flavors based on further study of vaping s potential risks and benefits  The FDA did ban flavors in cigars  The agency said as more scientific data emerges on potential dangers from e cigarette vapor  it will consider restricting advertising of the products  In 2009  Congress allowed the FDA to extend its oversight to all tobacco products  The agency began looking at e cigarettes  which were quickly gaining traction in the U S  market  Cigars had previously not been regulated by the FDA  Cigar makers had lobbied for their more expensive  typically hand rolled products to be excluded from such oversight  The FDA will review products introduced after Feb  15  2007  but will give manufacturers of e cigarettes and these other products up to two years to submit applications  E cigarette makers can continue to sell those products while the review is pending   Agency officials expect that most products on the market will require its review  a costly prospect for the many smaller manufacturers of vaping devices   The winners are the large tobacco manufacturers  primarily Altria  N MO  and Reynolds  American   N RAI   which have the experience and financial wherewithal  to deal with FDA processes  Morningstar equity analyst Adam Fleck said   The net result is a very fragmented e cigarette market is likely to be consolidated   The cigar market is expected to grow to more than  8 9 billion in 2019  up from  7 4 billion in 2009  according to Euromonitor  It is dominated by Swisher International  Altria and Imperial  which combined in 2014 sold about half of the cigars in the United States  according to Euromonitor  
Companies will be allowed to continue marketing their products while the FDA conducts its reviews  which could take 12 months after submission ",2016-05-05,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-regulators-ban-e-cigarette,-cigar-sales-to-people-under-18-400145",400145

199140,420656,MO,SABMiller board to weigh AB InBev takeover terms as shareholder meeting looms  source,news,"LONDON  Reuters    SABMiller  L SAB  has not ruled out asking  Anheuser Busch InBev   BR ABI  to revamp its proposed  100 billion plus takeover offer before formally recommending the bid  a source close to the London listed brewer told Reuters  amid rising shareholder disquiet about the terms 
SABMiller s board is meeting on Wednesday  a day before its annual shareholder meeting  to discuss how to quell unease about the disparity between ABI s 44 pounds per share cash offer and a stock and cash alternative designed for SAB s biggest investors  cigarette maker Altria  N MO  and Colombia s Santo Domingo family  the source said 
When the original deal was announced in November  that partial share alternative    which avoids triggering large tax bills    was worth about 39 pounds 
But the recent fall in the pound and rise in ABI s shares have increased its value to about 51 pounds  representing a premium of around 15 percent to the cash offer 
All investors have the option to take the stock and cash offer but under current terms the stock cannot be traded for five years  rendering the option highly unattractive for most fund managers 
 At this stage the board will reassure investors and tell them their concerns will only be addressed after the deal gets regulatory clearance   the first source close to SAB said 
 After the pre conditions are satisfied   the board  will need to decide whether to refresh its recommendation for the ABI bid or ask for improved terms   the source added 
SABMiller declined to comment 
A second source close to SABMiller described the long planned meeting as  routine  prior to an AGM and said it was unconnected to recent stakebuilding by activist investors The Children s Investment Fund Management  TCI  and Elliott Advisors 
Those investments have raised the prospects of a late opportunistic push for more cash from ABI  which counts Budweiser and Stella Artois among its top brands 
APPROVALS
ABI s proposed takeover has already been approved by European and South African regulators but U S  and Chinese antitrust authorities have yet to sanction the union 
Until then  the deal terms remain flexible and subject to revision  the first source said 
 Regulatory approval is expected very soon  It could come any time now and this is why agitators are building stakes   the source said 
Minority investors meanwhile are waiting nervously to see if any last minute jostling could secure them more cash or derail the merger altogether 
 They  Elliott  have previous form here in trying to extract value close to decision day     but the deal feels done so it may be too little too late   said one SABMiller investor  who said he would back a campaign for fresh terms as it was in his clients  interests 
 The fall in sterling makes the cash offer less attractive to general shareholders  The  insiders  got a better deal here than the other shareholders   he said 
Besides increasing the cash offer to minority investors  sources have suggested that ABI could also address the disparity by increasing the cash component offered to Altria and the Santo Domingos or reducing the lock up period on the shares 

Currently structured as a  scheme of arrangement   the deal needs approval by 75 percent of shareholders but sources also said ABI could switch to a straight takeover offer  which only needs a majority ",2016-07-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sabmiller-board-to-weigh-ab-inbev-takeover-terms-as-shareholder-meeting-looms:-source-415443,415443

199150,420666,MO,AB InBev faces delicate balance in structuring SABMiller bid,news,"By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller BRUSSELS LONDON  Reuters    A  70 billion debt package being arranged to fund Anheuser Busch InBev s  BR ABI  takeover of SABMiller  L SAB  still leaves the world s largest brewer with a tricky balancing act in satisfying a range of shareholder camps with different needs  SABMiller s two major shareholders face potential capital gains taxes  so may want to get paid in shares   which would conflict with AB InBev s controlling shareholders  desire to limit the dilution to their control that would come with issuing new shares   Furthermore  some shareholders might have geographical restrictions tied to the location of the share listing  Marlboro maker Altria  N MO  and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia together own 42 percent of SABMiller  and are widely believed to prefer shares in an enlarged company rather than cash  to avoid triggering capital gains taxes on the proceeds of their stakes  worth about  24 billion and  13 billion  respectively  at current prices    We can say with confidence that Santo Domingo and Altria will want a decent chunk of equity  probably the majority   said Exane  BNP Paribas   PARIS BNPP  analyst Eamonn Ferry   The wild card is how much of the free float would want equity too   he added  referring to shareholders beyond the major two  AB InBev  maker of Budweiser  Stella Artois and Corona  is expected to have offered between 40 and 45 pounds per share for its nearest rival within the next two weeks  It is already asking banks to underwrite up to  70 billion in debt financing  sources have told Reuters  With a deal therefore costing as much as  110 billion  that leaves a likely share issue of as much as  40 billion  a ratio that roughly fits the 60 40 split expected by analysts  who note the Brazilian and Belgian founding families of AB InBev  who own 52 percent of its shares  would not want to largely dilute their control by issuing too much new equity   It is hard to over estimate the importance that ABI assigns to this ownership structure   said Nomura analysts earlier this month   This drives an ownership culture and a long term view    SABMiller said on Sept  16 that AB InBev had approached it about a friendly takeover that would form a combined group brewing a third of the world s beer  UK takeover rules require AB InBev to make a formal offer by Oct  14  though the parties are not required to disclose the offer   Despite the combination having been discussed for years  sources say one of the difficulties in pulling it off is finding a structure that ensures the two biggest shareholders get shares and the rest cash  while still offering the same to all shareholders    That s the problem   said an industry banker not involved in the deal   SABMiller and AB InBev declined to comment  Officials representing Altria and the Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached   FOUNDING FAMILIES  One way to ease dilution of control is to bring the Santo Domingo family into the core group of controlling insiders  say analysts  That would makes sense given the family are founders of a Colombian brewer that SABMiller bought in 2005  and the controlling group includes the founding families of AB InBev   The Santo Domingos clearly know the beer business quite well  They d be more than happy to have money invested in ABI and the 3G guys   said Exane s Ferry  referring to private equity firm 3G Capital  which is run by some of AB InBev s controlling shareholders   3G gained control of U S  food group Kraft Heinz  O KHC  following deals financed in part by billionaire Warren Buffett  Members of the Santo Domingo family have invested with 3G  according to the Wall Street Journal   Depending on price  AB InBev s core shareholder group could see their ownership of the merged group fall from 52 percent to just over 40 percent with that level of new equity  If Santo Domingo s

Brewing giant Anheuser Busch InBev raised its bid Wednesday for SABMiller  LONDON SAB  Plc  the world s second largest brewer  In a statement  the Belgian company said it has made a proposal to buy SABMiller for 42 15 pounds   64 3  per share in cash  valuing the company at 68 24 billion pounds   104 billion  
The proposal represents a premium of about 44 percent over SABMiller s closing share price of 29 34 on Sept  14    a day before speculation arose of a takeover bid by AB InBev 
 AB InBev has made two prior written proposals in private to SABMiller  the first at GBP 38 00 per share in cash and the second at GBP 40 00 per share in cash   the Belgian company  which makes Budweiser and Stella Artois  said  in the statement   AB InBev is disappointed that the Board of SABMiller has rejected both of these prior approaches without any meaningful engagement  
SABMiller announced last month that AB InBev  which makes Budweiser and Stella Artois  had approached it regarding a takeover  The deal  if it materializes  would be the biggest ever takeover of a British company  and create a brewing giant worth  250 billion that would produce a third of the world s beer 
SABMiller shares opened sharply higher Wednesday  and were trading up 3 percent  And  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  SABMiller s largest shareholder with a 27 percent stake  said it supported the latest proposal 
 Altria believes that a combination of these two companies would create significant value for all SABMiller shareholders   the company said  in a statement released Wednesday   Altria urges SABMiller s board to engage promptly and constructively with AB InBev to agree on the terms of a recommended offer

brewer  has promptly rejected an improved takeover proposal from  Anheuser Busch InBev   BR ABI   saying its 68 billion pound   104 billion  valuation was  very substantially  under par  Refusal of the offer  made public on Wednesday after earlier proposals were refused privately  opens the door to a week of intense wrangling before an Oct  14 deadline for a formal bid set by the UK takeover panel  The deal would be one of the biggest in corporate history  uniting the maker of Budweiser  Corona and Stella Artois beers with that of Peroni  Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell  The combined entity would make nearly a third of the world s beer   AB InBev realistically needs access to SAB s private financial data if it is to make an informed formal bid  but said that so far the board had not engaged meaningfully   A deadline extension can be granted if SABMiller asks for it  and AB InBev wants shareholders to lobby the company   The deadline is approaching and we thought we should make it public   AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said on a conference call   Now it s up to the shareholders to have a look at it  If they think this is a good offer  they should act and encourage the board to engage   Brito said he was committed to a friendly deal  but did not rule out going hostile   I don t want to go there now  I think there s too much to be gained in the next few days   he said  SHAREHOLDER RESPONSE  Belgium based AB InBev went public with its offer of 42 15 pounds in cash per SABMiller share  after the board rejected two prior approaches  at 38 and 40 pounds  The offer includes a discounted cash and share alternative designed only for SAB s two largest shareholders   Altria Group   N MO  and BevCo  The discount aims to satisfy their desire to avoid huge taxes on cash gains and ensure all other shareholders accept cash  which would be financed with the help of a  70 billion debt package being lined up  Altria  the tobacco group which has 26 6 percent of SABMiller  said it supported the bid and would be prepared to opt for the share alternative  AB InBev said it lacked the support of BevCo  controlled by the Santo Domingo family of Colombia  Representatives for BevCo  which owns about 13 percent of SABMiller  could not be reached by Reuters  BevCo has two seats on the SABMiller board   SABMiller said its board  excluding the three members nominated by Altria  unanimously rejected the proposal   It still very substantially undervalues SABMiller  its unique and unmatched footprint  and its standalone prospects   the UK based company said in a statement  SABMiller Chairman Jan du Plessis called his company  the crown jewel of the global brewing industry  and said AB InBev s proposals were designed to be unattractive to many shareholders  Lawyers not involved in the deal interpreted SAB s language as implying that it could want as much as 10 percent more than the proposed price  which amounts to a 44 percent premium to SAB s share price before news of AB InBev s approach was made public on Sept  16  AB InBev s CEO called the price  full  and said SAB s board was  over optimistic  about its standalone prospects  saying the company would need an almost 50 percent jump in operating earnings in U S  dollars to make up the value he is offering and that would likely not happen for at least three or four years  The cash and share alternative  which is technically open to all shareholders  would give them 2 37 pounds per share plus 0 48 special unlisted AB InBev shares that are convertible into ordinary stock after a five year lock up period  Given that AB InBev intends to use this instrument to acquire the stakes of Altria and BevCo  which together own about 41 percent of the company  SABMiller said the implied price tag was only 40 21 pounds per share  or 65 billion pounds   99 53 billion   RBC Capital Markets analysts said the proposal appeared some way below a  knock out  bid  and Bernstein Securities said a higher bid  and acceptance  was the most likely outcome  SABMiller shares closed up 0 3 percent at 37 24 pounds  while AB InBev closed up 0 6 percent in Brussels at 98 65 euros  AFRICA THE PRIZE Analysts have long seen this deal as the likely end game for decades of industry consolidation  as the big four   AB InBev  SABMiller   Heineken   AS HEIN  and Carlsberg  CO CARLb  already brew over half the world s beer  It would add Africa and certain Latin American and Asian breweries to AB InBev s presence across the Americas    We believe Africa in particular will be a key driver for the joint company in the future   Brito said  AB InBev also said it planned to establish a secondary share listing and regional headquarters in Johannesburg  where SABMiller has a secondary listing  which local investors have said they want retained  Public Investment Corp  a South African state owned firm with a 3 4 percent stake in SABMiller  said the listing addressed one of its concerns and that it would wait for guidance from SABMiller s board  AB InBev  partly controlled by 3G Capital  a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors  has a strong track record for takeovers  followed by keen cost cutting  but Brito declined to say what potential synergies a SABMiller deal might realise

Anheuser Busch Inbev SA  N BUD  and SABMiller  L SAB  Plc  the world s top two beer companies  have reached an agreement to merge  after Budweiser s Belgian Brazilian owner extended an offer of 44 pounds   67 48  per share to SABMiller creating a global beer behemoth  Various reports valued the deal to be worth between  104 billion to  107 billion 
The final agreement  announced Tuesday  came after multiple  unsuccessful takeover attempts  Under the terms of the deal  Anheuser Busch InBev said it will pay 44 pounds  or about  67 48  a share in cash for SABMiller  That is also a 50 percent premium to the closing price in mid September  before Anheuser Busch InBev confirmed it had approached SABMiller about a combination 
Together  the two companies could create a mega global brewing giant  and the deal is the biggest takeover of a British company in history 
The combined company will control 31 percent of the global beer market  topping Heineken  the next biggest brewer  which has 9 percent of the market  The deal could also help Anheuser Busch  which has had success in Europe  North Africa and Asia  expand into the African and Australian markets  according to the Associated Press 
The pairing of these two giants still faces multiple regulatory headwinds  including antitrust hurdles spanning the globe from the U S  to China 
And  of course  corporate combinations of this magnitude aren t always a recipe for successful   Research consistently finds that between 60  and 80  of acquisitions materially fail to deliver expected benefits and more than 50  destroy shareholder value   says John Colley  Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School and an expert on large scale mergers   The reasons usually lie in being forced to pay too much  botched integration  and over estimation of merger benefits

199161,420677,MO,Exclusive  With feds slow to act  states target e cigarette sales to minors ,news,"By Jilian Mincer NEW YORK  Reuters    Frustrated by the slow pace of federal action  state attorneys general are waging their own campaigns against the sale and advertising of e cigarettes to minors  More than a dozen AGs  including those in New York  California  Indiana and Ohio  are using new state and local laws   some of which they helped craft   to put pressure on the industry at all levels  from neighborhood vape shops to big tobacco companies like  Altria Group   N MO  and Reynolds American Inc  N RAI    Much of the campaign so far has involved threats to sue violators or appeals to a company s sense of responsibility  though some lawsuits have been filed  too   State actions have accelerated in the wake of government data released in April  which showed that teen use of e cigarettes tripled in 2014 alone  making them more common for youngsters than tobacco    The key is to avoid another generation being addicted to nicotine   Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in an interview   State attorneys general played a pivotal role during the 1990s in battling tobacco companies over conventional cigarettes   The Master Settlement Agreement  MSA   an accord reached in November 1998 between the state attorneys general of 46 states  five U S  territories  the District of Columbia and the five largest tobacco companies  resulted in significant changes to cigarette marketing and required the tobacco industry to pay the states about  10 billion annually for the indefinite future  FEDERAL ACTION URGED Nearly a year ago  a group of AGs asked the U S  Food and Drug Administration to take a tougher line on e cigarettes  the risks and benefits of which are still being studied   In April of 2014  the agency proposed banning the sale of e cigarettes to people under the age of 18  but did not recommend prohibiting advertising  flavored products or online sales   all of which help make the devices attractive to youngsters  according to public health advocates  The FDA proposal has been under review ever since  which has meant that vaping remains legal for youths in states that haven t passed laws banning it  The agency is likely to finalize its new e cigarette regulations later this summer  though it could be several years before the federal rules go into effect   Federal regulations and the 1998 Master Settlement prohibit makers of conventional cigarettes from targeting youth and from advertising on television  billboards and mass transit  but the rules don t apply to e cigarettes  So far  however  46 states have passed laws banning their sale to minors  Twelve of those states have also passed laws requiring child proof packaging for e liquids and e cigarettes  according to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids  AGs are using these laws  as well as others not directly tied to e cigarettes  to force companies to drop ads appealing to teens  switch to child proof packaging and spend thousands of dollars on more vigilant age verification systems for their websites and online deliveries  In June  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced settlements with four companies that were not complying with the state s rule about child resistant packaging for nicotine liquids   Reuters spoke with more than 10 e cigarette and vaping companies   including Reynolds American  which sells Vuse  and Altria Group  which sells MarkTen and Green Smoke   that acknowledged they have been contacted by state law enforcers or by the National Associations of Attorneys General  Reynolds and Altria say their brands were not in violation of local laws    COORDINATING EFFORTS Some of the AGs have coordinated their efforts  One group is pressuring certain e cigarette manufacturers and vendors to limit ads that appeal to teens  especially on company websites and places like YouTube   Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine  along with colleagues from several other states  sent a letter in April to privately held manufacturer NJOY  asking it to  immediately instruct YouTube to restrict  access to its advertisements to adults  NJOY said in an April letter to DeWine that more than 90 percent of the U S  viewers who have watched its hosted YouTube videos are at least 18  and the company said it would suspend videos if that figure fell to 85 percent or less   NJOY  which previously settled a case with California over allegations of targeting minors and deceptive marketing  would not comment further  California has sent letters to more than 150 e cigarette and vaping companies in recent years  to encourage voluntary compliance with applicable state and federal laws   including a ban on sales to youth  according to documents reviewed by Reuters   The state is also pursuing companies that sell fruit  flavored vaping liquids that appeal to teens and those that make false or misleading statements in their advertisements  One letter sent by the state asked a manufacturer to quit claiming that  electronic cigarettes are one of the safest forms of nicotine available  and that  when you exhale  you are exhaling harmless water vapor    Many companies have taken some or all of our recommended steps   said Kristin Ford  a spokeswoman for Attorney General Kamala Harris  AGs are paying particular attention to sales on websites  a popular source of vaping materials for teens  who trade information about which ones require little proof of age  Jan Verleur  CEO and co founder of electronic cigarette company VMR Products  said his company changed its age verification system in some states after being contacted by a state AG  He estimated the cost per order would increase by about 50 cents  but would not say if VMR would absorb any of that  The company makes about half its sales online

199163,420679,MO,UPDATE 2 Obama signs landmark law to regulate tobacco,news,"  New law allows tough new FDA limits on tobacco
   Tobacco blamed for 440 000 U S  deaths per year
   Companies say will comply with regulations
  Adds quotes from Obama  comments from industry 
 By Jeff Mason
 WASHINGTON  June 22  Reuters    President Barack Obama 
citing his own struggle to give up smoking  signed a law on
Monday giving the U S  government broad regulatory power for
the first time over cigarettes and other tobacco products 
 Obama said the law would curb the ability of tobacco
companies to market their products to the young 
  Almost 90 percent of all smokers began at or before their
18th birthday   Obama said at a White House ceremony before
signing the bill 
  I know    I was one of these teenagers  and so I know how
difficult it can be to break this habit when it s been with you
for a long time  
 Obama s spokesman  Robert Gibbs  said Obama s smoking habit
was  something that he continues to struggle with   He declined
to answer directly whether the president still smoked 
 The law followed a campaign by tobacco industry foes in
Congress for more than a decade to put cigarettes under the
control of the U S  Food and Drug Administration 
 It allows the FDA to put strict limits on the manufacturing
and marketing of tobacco products but stops short of allowing
it to ban cigarettes or their addictive ingredient nicotine 
 Nearly 20 percent of Americans smoke  and tobacco use kills
about 440 000 people a year in the United States due to cancer 
heart disease  emphysema and other ailments 
 Obama cited those statistics when declaring the completion
of the law a victory 
  We ve known about this for decades  but despite the best
efforts and good progress made by so many leaders and advocates
with us today  the tobacco industry and its special interest
lobbying have generally won the day   he said 
  Their campaign has finally failed   he continued    The
law  will force these companies to more clearly and publicly
acknowledge the harmful and deadly effects of the products they
sell  
  LIFESAVING  LAW
 Health groups welcomed the new law  although some experts
have said it did not go far enough to help prevent smoking 
  This lifesaving new law has the potential to break the
deadly cycle of addiction and put an end to Big Tobacco s
targeting of our nation s children   said John Seffrin  head of
the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network 
 Altria Group Inc  the parent company of the largest U S 
cigarette maker  Philip Morris  also said it welcomed the new
rules 
  We have consistently advocated for federal regulation that
recognizes the serious harm caused by tobacco products  that
helps ensure tobacco companies do not market tobacco products
to children and that also acknowledges that tobacco products
are and should remain legal products for adults   said Michael
Szymanczyk  the group s chairman and chief executive officer 
 Reynolds American Inc s R J  Reynolds Tobacco unit  which
like other smaller tobacco companies opposed the new oversight 
said it respected the regulations and would seek to participate
in the FDA s rule making process 
  It has become law  and we will of course comply with the
law   company spokeswoman Maura Payne told Reuters 
 Representatives for other tobacco makers  including Vector
Group Ltd s Liggett Group Inc and Lorillard Inc s Lorillard
Tobacco Company either could not be reached or had no immediate
comment

199164,420680,MO,As millions vape  e cigarette researchers count puffs  scour Facebook,news,"By Sharon Begley  NEW YORK  Reuters    One team of researchers assessing the risks of electronic cigarettes is counting the puffs taken by volunteer  vapers   Another will comb Facebook for posts on how people are tinkering with e cigarettes to make the devices deliver extra nicotine  A third is building a virtual convenience store for 13 to 17 year olds  measuring how e cigarette displays and price promotions influence whether minors buy the increasingly popular devices   The U S  Food and Drug Administration is spending  270 million on these and 45 other research projects to determine the risks of e cigarettes before millions more Americans become hooked on the devices    They want data and they want it yesterday   said Dr Suchitra Krishnan Sarin of Yale University  who is leading four projects        Yesterday   however  is years away   Final results may not be available before 2018  researchers leading the FDA funded projects told Reuters  That timetable  which has not been reported before  underscores how the slow pace of science is contributing to a regulatory vacuum  allowing e cigarette makers to sell their products virtually unchallenged   To be sure  studies of e cigarettes not funded by the FDA are also under way  and the agency can factor those results into any action it takes  But the FDA chose these 48 projects because they address questions central to future regulations   The e cigarette industry  which Wells Fargo Securities estimates will make  2 billion in global sales this year  says the FDA must wait for the results of the research before it issues any regulations  or manufacturers risk being driven out of business by unproven fears about their products    There shouldn t be regulations akin to those for cigarettes without evidence of similar health impact  especially since the preliminary evidence is positive for the industry  when it comes to comparing the contents of e cigarette vapor to tobacco smoke  said attorney Bryan Haynes  His Richmond  Virginia based firm Troutman Sanders represents e cigarette manufacturers   Backed by the world s biggest tobacco companies  the industry is aggressively expanding its marketing across the country  More than 14 million U S  adults and nearly 2 million teens and tweens have used e cigarettes  and the rate of use among high schoolers doubled from 2011 to 2012  the latest data available       The FDA  will always make regulatory decisions based on the best available science   said an agency spokeswoman   With regard to e cigarettes  the agency does not believe it will take many years to create the regulatory framework  once the FDA has the basic authority to regulate the products  which could happen next year          The missing science includes basic questions such as what compounds are in the vapor produced by e cigarettes  It also includes complicated ones like whether flavors such as butterscotch and bubble gum entice children to vape  how e cigarette displays in online stores affect teenagers  desire to buy vaping liquid  and  perhaps most crucial  whether e cigarettes will reduce the number of smokers or produce millions of new nicotine addicts   The Yale team  for instance  will study whether menthol and flavors such as chocolate and cherry increase the appeal of e cigarettes  especially to 16 to 18 year old smokers or  dual users  who both smoke and vape  If that turns out to be the case  the FDA would have scientific support for regulating          We ll have the first results within two years  and complete ones in four to five  Krishnan Sarin said        REAL TIME EXPERIMENT      As an uncontrolled experiment in public health  the use of electronic cigarettes is rivaled only by conventional tobacco smoking  a habit adopted by half of American men and one third of women during its peak in the 1960s  The first Surgeon General s report on the health dangers of cigarettes was released in 1964  when more than 40 percent of American adults were already hooked  To date  more than 10 million Americans have died from illnesses tied to smoking tobacco       Research on e cigarettes has moved more quickly  partly because scientists can draw on regular tobacco research to establish the biological effects of vaping   The cartridge like devices were first introduced in the United States by start up manufacturers in 2007  Now  the U S  market is dominated by blu  a brand owned by Lorillard Inc   Other leading tobacco companies are making a big push for a share of the growing market  R J  Reynolds Vapor Co   a subsidiary of Reynolds American  began selling its Vuse e cigarette nationwide last month and Altria s NuMark subsidiary plans to do so with its MarkTen later this year       The FDA got authority to regulate tobacco products  both traditional and novel  with the 2009 Tobacco Control Act  In April  the FDA proposed banning e cigarette sales to minors  angering public health advocates who want more far reaching prohibitions on online sales  advertising and flavors    The FDA began funding e cigarette research in 2012  An FDA funded project at the University of Louisville in Kentucky illustrates why the pace of science is slow   Scientists there will look at three or four brands of e cigarettes and analyze their volatile organic compounds  flavorings and particulate matter to see how they affect lung and other cells in lab mice  said lead researcher Dr Sanjay Srivastata       This spring  he began exposing the animals to e cigarette vapor for up to six months  with full results expected in 2015  While those findings could help FDA quantify risks from vaping  results extending the conclusions to humans are as much as five years away             THE  PLEASURES OF NICOTINE       Another crucial question researchers are trying to answer is whether e cigarettes will be used mostly by nicotine newbies  including adolescents  by ex smokers craving a nicotine hit without the carcinogens of tobacco  or by smokers trying to quit        To get a handle on who is likely to use e cigarettes  scientists at Georgia State University School of Public Health will conduct online surveys of 6 000 people to assess whether they perceive e cigarettes as less harmful than the traditional kind  why those who have switched from the latter to e cigarettes did so  and what influences people s perceptions of the product s risk        This is the kind of research that is going to be informing the FDA s regulatory process   said Michael Eriksen  dean of the School of Public Health and leader of three FDA funded projects on tobacco         The FDA s proposed e cigarette rules would give it the power to regulate the ingredients in the vaping liquid  but are silent on the plumes of vapor produced when the liquid is heated  According to research at Virginia Commonwealth University  that may be a dangerous oversight  a form of e cigarettes called tank systems can get so hot the vapor can contain the carcinogen formaldehyde and other toxic compounds        We want to know what s in the emissions  not just the ingredients   said VCU toxicologist Robert Balster  who is helping to oversee four FDA funded projects       To find out  VCU engineers are constructing mechanical vaping devices to measure how temperature  voltage  and other parameters affect the content of the plumes from e cigarettes  They will next comb through Facebook and blog postings to see whether vapers like super hot temperatures  for instance  Combining the results of the mechanical vaper and real life habits should show what emissions people are exposed to   
     If it turns out that people are tinkering with the electronics to increase the voltage of e cigarettes  and FDA regulations limit the maximum voltage  that s useful to know   since it may justify a requirement that the devices be tinker proof  said Balster       Full results are years away  he said   but we re mindful of getting information to FDA in a timely manner  They re under a lot of pressure to get moving       Reporting by Sharon Begley in New York and Toni Clarke in Washington  Editing by Michele Gershberg and Ross Colvin ",2014-07-07,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/as-millions-vape,-e-cigarette-researchers-count-puffs,-scour-facebook-293252",293252

Monthly outlook  bias lower 
YM futures trader  no trade tonight 

Well the big Brexit bust exploded in everyone s face on Friday as traders and investors alike ran around all day like chickens with their heads cut off yelling  SELL SELL SELL    I spent some time this weekend reading the commentary in the news and online  Before long  I d gotten opinions that ranged the entire gamut from  no big deal  to  the End Days are upon us   No one  and I mean literally no one knows just what the eventual fallout from Brexit will be  me included 
I will simply point out the following facts  Friday s intraday low in the Dow was not lower than that on May 19th  just a little bit more than a month ago  The Dow is now still higher than its close on March 16th  a little more than three months ago  The EU dates back to 1957 when the Dow was trading at 4164  It got there from a level of 28 in 1896  through a Great Depression and two World Wars all without the help of the EU  Last Thursday  BB  Before Brexit   a day was 24 hours long and the sun rose in the east  Tomorrow  3 days AB  After Brexit  I predict with some certainty that a day will be 24 hours long and the sun will still rise in the east 
So what is the Night Owl planning to do with her personal portfolio  Same thing I did going into the Great Recession in 2008  nothing  That worked out pretty well and this will too  Oh  and in case anyone is wondering  I was actually higher most of Friday due largely to my REIT s and a chunk of Altria  NYSE MO  until the continuing slide into the end of the day left me with a 0 42  loss  a number that pales in comparison to my worst day this year  January 15th when I somehow managed to lose 2 74   and it s certainly batter than the Dow s 3 39  plunge Friday  But I still ended the week last week up 0 58   so I can t complain too much 
I m not saying the selling s done yet  but maybe the charts hold some clues as to what will happen on Monday as we start the last week of June  So we set aside all the Nattering Nabobs of Negativity as well as the Pandering Pundits of Positivity  and examine the charts  which are the only facts we have 
The technicals
The Dow  We all know what happened Friday The Dow put in a giant red marubozu that broke monthly support at 17 435 and then kept right on going through the lower BB at 17 525 before finally stopping at 17 401  largely because the bell rang  That sent all the indicators lower and completed a bearish stochastic crossover  So there s clearly nothing bullish on this chart tonight 
The VIX  This is worth a chart  On Friday the VIX rocketed up 49 33  for the tallest doji I ve ever seen The really surprising thing here is that the VIX just barely hit 26 and didn t come close to the highs we hit back in January and February when we came close to 30 during the crises about     uh yeah well I don t remember what seemed so important back then either anymore  Of note though is that this jump wasn t enough to send the VIX oversold and we also got a bullish stochastic crossover out of it  so I m a bit wary of calling it lower on Monday despite the mega doji 

Market index futures  Tonight  all three futures are lower at 12 24 AM EDT with ES down 0 42   Last Friday  ES had its worst day since the Bronze Age crashing through support at 2060  then its lower BB at 2041  and finally support at 2029  and then testing its lower BB at 1999 before finally recovering a bit to 2018 50  Ordinarily  I d say we d be due for at least a DCB after a day like that  but we re gapping lower again in the new Sunday overnight  which all bodes poorly for Monday 
 ES daily pivot  Tonight the ES daily pivot dives from 2100 67 to 2045 67   ES remains well below its new pivot so this indicator continues bearish 
Dollar index  And along with all the other extreme charts  the dollar was no exception Friday  zooming up 2 19  on a gap up doji star that touched its upper BB  That completed a bullish stochastic crossover and very nearly sent it from oversold to overbought in just one day  The conventional wisdom here says that the dollar is due for retracement on Monday  but these are not conventional times 
Euro  And of course  the euro took a powder on Friday  travelling from upper BB to lower BB in one day  It also broke under its 200 day MA intraday before recovering a bit to close at 1 11555  But even that wasn t enough to send it oversold and indeed  in perhaps a sign of what s to come  it s continuing lower in the overnight  gapping right back down below its 200 day MA 
Transportation  The trans were hit even harder than the Dow on Friday  off 4 58   also busting below their lower BB  But even that wasn t enough to send them oversold so amazingly I can t call a reversal here just yet 

It s hard to know exactly what to make of the charts tonight  They re all so overextended that it s hard to imagine not getting at least a DCB out of them  But it s also Sunday night and the futures are gapping down and not making any attempt at all to rally  And despite the big dump on Friday  amazingly the market indicators are not yet down to the oversold levels from which rallies spring  In particular  the SPX Hi Lo indicator is at 77  nowhere near as low as it should be for a decent rally  I d like to say the selling s over but I can t because I think we close Monday lower

199254,420770,MO,Reynolds  RAI  Vs  Altria  MO   Which Is The Best Tobacco Stock ,opinion,"Reynolds America Inc    NYSE RAI   and Altria Group   NYSE MO   are two of the largest tobacco companies in America   The brands compete against one another  but there is a clear size discrepancy between the two  
Both companies look like a sure bet over the long term  and they dole out attractive dividends   Dividend yields for Altria and Reynolds are 3 5  and 3 29  respectively   They both have betas under 0 5  so they should stand to help you hedge your exposure to market volatility       
Altria has a market capitalization of  126 39 billion  and Reynolds has a cap of  72 99 billion  Last year  MO and RAI generated sales of  25 434 billion and  10 675 billion respectively   This information doesn t exactly tell you which stock is more attractive though   In order to evaluate which stock makes for a better investment over the short term  we will evaluate the companies across important growth  value  and earnings related metrics 
Altria Group
 
Value
Altria has a range of products in its portfolio  offering cigarettes  smokeless tobacco  and even wine   The stock is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    MO looks a little heavy across some valuation metrics   It has a PEG of 2 82 and it trades at a forward PE of 21 12   The stock also has a price to sales of 6 48  and a higher debt to capital of 82 38  
Growth
Altria s EPS is projected to grow by 9 21  this year  which is impressive   The rest of the tobacco space is projected to see EPS growth of 4 4  this year   In spite of the fact that it is a massive player in the space  Altria looks like it still has a growth path ahead of itself   The company has a net margin of 21 17   and sales are projected to grow by 11 33  this year 
Earnings
In the last two months  four analysts have revised their earnings estimates lower for this quarter   Our EPS consensus estimate for this quarter has declined slightly over the last thirty days  going from  0 81 to  0 80   Six analysts have revised their fiscal year earnings higher in the last 60 days   In that same time span  no analysts have posted negative revisions for the current year   MO has beaten our EPS estimate in two of the last four quarters 

Reynolds America Inc
 
Value
Reynolds is home to popular cigarette brands such as Newport  Camel  and Pall Mall   It also sells smokeless tobacco  and one of its premier brands in this segment is Grizzly   Reynolds is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    The company s valuation is also a little hefty  but still seems to fare better compared to MO   RAI has a PEG of 1 79  and it also has a price to sales of 5 73   Reynolds is ahead of Altria across these two valuation metrics  but it has a slightly higher forward PE of 21 89   Unlike Altria  Reynolds has relatively lower levels of debt in its capital structure  with a debt to capital of 38 4  
Growth
Reynolds  sales and earnings are projected to grow by 19 36  and 17 55  respectively   This represents a much higher level of growth than Altria is expected to see this year   This makes sense though  since MO is more mature as the largest tobacco company in the US   Reynolds enjoys superior levels of profitability  and it has a net margin of 55 74  
Earnings
Over the last 60 days  RAI has seen mixed estimate revision activity from analysts for this quarter   Three analysts revised their EPS estimates higher while two pushed down their earnings expectations   As a result  our quarterly consensus estimate has seen a slight decline over the last 30 days  going from  0 61 to  0 60   Like Altria  current year estimates have been boosted upwards by all analysts making revisions over the last 60 days   However  our fiscal year consensus has stayed at  2 34 over the last month ",2016-05-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reynolds-(rai)-vs.-altria-(mo):-which-is-the-best-tobacco-stock-200129437,200129437
199268,420784,MO,Are E Cigarettes Done ,opinion,"Call it the revolution that wasn t  but it looks like e cigarettes might be getting stubbed out  Global trade data site Panjiva  that shipments of e cigarettes entering US  ports have been declining since late 2013 
Shipments of e cigarettes entering US ports   by quarter

Meanwhile  shipments of actual tobacco    you know  the carcinogenic stuff that kills you    have actually been on the rise 
U S  Imports of Tobacco   Dollar Value by Quarter

Now  before I go any further  I should point out a couple things  These data sets are looking at imports  not total sales or production  Plenty of e cigarette paraphernalia gets produced right here in the USA and America is also a major grower of tobacco  Sales e cigarettes and accessories have roughly doubled over the past two years to about  3 5 billion 
So  import data clearly does not tell the whole story  But it may give us advanced warning of a pending slowdown  If anything  the soaring US dollar should have caused a nice bump in shipment imports  which clearly has not happened  And looking at the bigger picture  lower shipments today mean than retailers might be projecting lower sales tomorrow 
What s The Story 
Part of it is regulation  When e cigarettes were first introduced  they existed in something of a regulatory limbo  It wasn t exactly clear which  if any  of the myriad of existing tobacco laws applied to e cigarettes  and  vaping  had become a legal way to smoke in public places where traditional cigarettes are banned  They were also an easy way for underage teenagers to get their nicotine fix  as there were initially no age restrictions on sale  But those regulatory loopholes are quickly getting closed  At least 42 states now ban sales of e cigarette products to minors  and bills are being considered in Massachusetts  North Dakota and even in lax regulation states like Texas and Montana 
Now  I m not necessarily a fan of government regulation  If I had my way  the e smokers would be left to exhale their water vapor in peace  But given the aggressiveness of all levels of government towards tobacco products    everything from Washington DC down to the local neighborhood association    we should have known it was just a matter of time before we saw an organized crackdown  Though hard data is hard to come by  in most cities the existing rules that ban traditional cigarette smoking are getting applied to e cigs  And the FDA is planning on releasing a set of new e cig regulations in June that will probably come close to treating e cigs like traditional cigarettes 
This is not necessarily a death knell for e cigs  After all  cigars enjoyed a major boom in popularity in the 1990s and 2000s even while the anti tobacco movement was in full swing  But it does suggest that the notion that e cigs would be the savior of Big Tobacco is ludicrous  As I wrote late last year  rather than save Big Tobacco  cheap e cigs filled with generic refill fluid are a lot more likely to speed up its demise  And to really put things in perspective  Altria Group  NYSE MO  annual revenues are more than five times larger than the most generous estimate of the revenues for the entire vaping industry  It s hard to see vaping replacing those lost revenues 
Ironically  an FDA crackdown on vaping could play into Big Tobacco s favor  Altria  Reynolds American  NYSE RAI  and their peers have the experience and legal budgets to navigate a regulatory onslaught better than newer e cig upstarts  While I don t believe that Big Tobacco has played its hand well with the rise of e cigs  see  Big Tobacco Botches the E Cig Name Game    they will probably end up being the last men standing 
Is There A Trade 
Probably not  Big Tobacco stocks are surprisingly expensive at today s prices  Altria and and Reynolds American trade for 17 times and 18 times their respective 2015 expected earnings and at the lowest dividend yields in memory  And remember  these are companies selling products in terminal decline 
My advice is to sell Big Tobacco  There are better    and safer income options to be found elsewhere

199281,420797,MO,Lorillard  A Bad Deal For Reynolds American Investors,opinion,"And then there were two   Two of the three remaining American  Big Tobacco  companies announced today that they would be merging  Reynolds American Inc   NYSE RAI  will be buying Lorillard Inc   NYSE LO  for  27 4 billion  including debt assumed 
Reynolds and Lorillard combined have sales of  13 3 billion and a market cap of  55 3 billion as of yesterday s prices  leaving Altria Group  NYSE MO   the maker of Marlboro and other iconic brands in the number one spot   Altria has annual revenues of  17 7 billion and sports a market cap of  84 5 billion   Breaking it out by market share  the new Reynolds will control about 42  of the U S  cigarette market  Altria will control about 51   and smaller and foreign brands will make up the rest 
I ll be brutally frank here  I question the value of this merger   Reynolds is paying a high price for what is  we should remember  a business in terminal decline   As of yesterday s close  Lorillard shares traded for 21 times earnings and at a dividend yield of only 3 8  quite low by the standards of a tobacco company 
Let me be clear on something  I m not necessarily opposed to buying stocks in industries that are in terminal decline   Under the right set of conditions barriers to new competitors  dominant market position  minimal need for new capital investment  ample cash flows for dividends and buybacks  etc  stocks with shrinking businesses can be excellent investments 
But the key here is price   An investment in a shrinking company only makes sense if it is priced at a deep discount to the broader market   And Lorillard as implausible as this is trades at a  to the S P 500 
Other Risk
Forgetting price for a moment  the Lorillard deal also brings with it regulatory risk   85  of Lorillard s sales come from its menthol brands  and these have become a lightning rod in recent years   The U S  Food and Drug Administration has already banned most flavored cigarettes and reported last year that it believes menthol cigarettes contribute to youth smoking 
Reynolds is effectively making a  27 4 billion bet that the FDA will leave menthol cigarettes alone   That seems reckless to me  it s a bet with modest upside and potentially disastrous downside 
Is there a trade to make here 
Yes  Sell Reynolds if you own it and move on 
I m not the biggest fan of tobacco stocks at current prices   I have shares of Altria and Philip Morris International    that I have owned for years as part of a dividend reinvestment strategy  but I haven t invested any significant new money in these positions in years because I see better income options elsewhere  such as in REITs 
If you feel you must own tobacco stocks  then I would go with Altria or Philip Morris International   While neither are fantastic bargains these days  neither have the potential regulatory time bomb that Reynolds does in its exposure to menthol   At time of writing  MO and PM sport dividend yields of 4 5  and 4 1   in line with RAI s 4 3

199297,420813,MO,High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio   March Update,opinion,In December 2010  I created a screen hypothetical portfolio called the  High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio   The screen is tracked publicly as a continuous hypothetical portfolio with a starting balance of  100 000 on   see the right hand column for a link to the spreadsheet   Like many of the screens  strategies  and portfolios I track and prefer  the High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio uses a small number of historically relevant ideas to create a simple  yet powerful investment plan  As I    Some studies have shown that the  highest yielding  low payout stocks perform better over time than stocks with higher payouts and lower yields   The High Yield Dividend Champion Portfolio attempts to capture the best high yield  low payout stocks with a history of raising dividends  There are numerous ways to gauge the  best  high yield low payout stocks  The screening process for this portfolio starts with the  Dividend Champions  as compiled by   The list is comprised of stocks that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 consecutive years   I announced some changes to the ranking system  The changes were not due to poor performance   the strategy has returned over 50  in the past two plus years We still begin with the Dividend Champion list  The list is first sorted by yield and the lowest 50  yielding stocks are eliminated The remaining stocks are then assigned a rank based on their yield  the higher the yield the higher the rank   payout ratio  the lower the payout ratio the higher the rank   3 year dividend growth rate  and 5 10 year Dividend Acceleration Deceleration  5 year average increase divided by 10 year average increase   Extra weight is given to yield and payout ratio rankings The top 10 stocks based on the new ranking system make the portfolio  Stocks will be sold at the re balance date  generally around the 5th of the month  when they drop out of the top 15  to limit turnover  and are replaced with the next highest rated stock This month there are two new positions  1st Source  SRCE  was sold for a one month gain of 2 92  and a purchase date of 2 5 2013  Diebold  DBD  was sold for a loss of 13 92   excluding dividends  with an original purchase date of 8 3 12 Proceeds from the sale were used to purchase 395 shares of Altria Group  MO  and 371 shares of UGI Corp  UGI  The top 17 stocks based on the new ranking methodology are below and displayed in order of their ranking The current portfolio is below All returns exclude commissions and taxes and are hypothetical  Real results will differ If you enjoy these free tools  please consider making a donation on the home page of Scott s Investments using the Paypal link in the upper right corner Disclaimer  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author is not a financial adviser  Stock Loon LLC  Scott s Investments and its author does not offer recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose  Please consult your own investment adviser and do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions  Please read the full disclaimer at the bottom of ,2013-03-06,Scott's Investments,https://www.investing.com/analysis/high-yield-dividend-champion-portfolio-–-march-update-157849,157849
199306,420822,MO,Altria Group  Suggestion For A Long Trade,opinion,On June 12  2012  I published an article on Seeking Alpha titled Altria Group  A Short Of Sorts  Then Long  Key statistics for Altria Group  MO  based on my recommendation of June 12  2012  Bias  Short  Date Recommended  June12  2012  Strike Price   33 36  Date Hit  June 12  2012  Cost Average   36 03  Date Hit  July 20  2012  Exit Price   33 75  Date Hit  August 23  2012  Profit  Loss  Gain 4 78  I have been patiently waiting for the Altria Designated Market Maker to show his hand  It seems incomprehensible to me that anyone would trade these markets and leave the most prominent influence out of the equation  To achieve analytic clarity one must objectively link transactional realities to the powers from which they emanate  all the while keeping in mind the dual nature of trading  Long vs  Short   If nothing else it should prove that two equally valid types of trading exist  As I have said on numerous occasions  this is how one transforms the threat of chance into a positive force to be exploited I suspect  Altria Group will be the issue of choice in the upcoming  window dressing   which always arises at the end of quarters  It is being set up now  The purpose of the recent pullback off of historic highs was intended to facilitate the window dressing As I have said on previous occasions  the fund managers will be mimicking Neiman Marcus at Christmas  They will engage in that deceptive practice to give the appearance of being in the right stock  even if at the wrong time  The fund managers flocking to Altria Group will rival the great migration  WHY  Because the laws of  fashionable assumptions  dictate this  it is in an uptrend  it pays a dividend and everybody knows about it Investors often mistakenly assume that professional money managers know more than they do  Even though the  professionals  who  know more  have gained most of what they know from the morning paper  Very little of it is validated and even less is actually original thought  They hold on to old timeless relics of anachronistic theories because they sound interesting  Sounding interesting is better applied and certainly more relevant in the realm of music appreciation as opposed to trading the market With respect to  Trends are your Friends   Trends are wonderful  exhilarating and they have a propensity to continue right up until they fail  THEY ALWAYS FAIL  Trends sometimes lull investors into a false sense of security  Not unlike cattle or sheep grazing in the pasture living a charmed existence  eating and drinking to their hearts content  right up until the day the trailers pull up and cart them off to the slaughterhouse  The big blocks and heavy aggregate volume is the equivalent of the trailers arriving at the fence post  At that point it was just a question as to who was going to be slaughtered  I suspect that many funds  those that still have pants  will be caught with them down yet again  particularly those who are interested and focused on the trend The irony is that the artificial demand in the issues to which the funds had been flocking will subside  The price of the issues will be dropped because the Designated Market Makers will have distributed most if not all of their inventory  In addition  they will have established short positions to capitalize on the imminent decline  they never miss an opportunity to profit anywhere in the merchandising cycle  On the basis of the foregoing  these are my views and observations  The Trade  I recommend establishing a long position in Altria Group  Open your long position  First Buy  with only   of whatever capital you intend to commit to Altria Group at  33 65 or better  Cost Average  Second Buy  the remaining   of the position at  30 96 and stop out at  29 69  Do not post your stop loss  I have said it before but it is so important that at the risk of being redundant and in an abundance of caution I will say it again  It is too easy for the Designated Market Maker to cash investors out by moving the price above or below your stop out and move the price right back up or down again  In addition  when a stop out is triggered it converts into a market order and that could be disastrous if the DMM decides to really take advantage  Remember the  Flash Crash   I would be looking to sell out of this position with an upside price target of  37 77  There is always the possibility that the trade may not work out  There Is Never A Sure Thing  particularly on a short  Investors must realize and recognize that there is never a sure thing  Sometimes events that have a low probability of occurring bring forth very serious consequences should they come into being  Investors must judiciously consider what the inherent practical limits are and how much they stand to gain in relation to the risks involved in establishing any position  In addition  persistence can become desperate folly by allowing a losing position to become a viable argument for deciding on a new position  Rather  such decisions should be based on the current and soon to be circumstances  Any position in which one unexpected factor has a significant impact on your portfolio is the result of poor planning  It is a fault most commonly associated with people who want to explain away their losses  SUN TZU   Art of War  Use an attack to exploit a victory  never use an attack to rescue a defeat   If you follow the process recommended and the trade does not work  the overall loss in this model is  3 000 00  That amounts to  003 of the overall portfolio  theoretically valued at  1 000 000   Finally  never be a brave and brainless investor because a fool and his money are soon parted  A portfolio of  1 000 000 should position size in the following manner  Disclosure  This is a trade  not an investment  Be ever vigilant  See Performance Tracking  ,2012-09-04,Gene

199316,420832,MO,4 High Yield  Sin Stocks  You Can t Afford To Ignore,opinion,To many people  it s hard to justify investing in companies that make such unloved products as tobacco  weapons or even alcohol  But income investors can find lots of reasons to like tobacco and alcohol stocks  namely their defensive nature and the fact that they typically perform quite well Despite well known health hazards  there are still plenty of people who smoke and drink  making demand for these products quite reliable  In addition  many of these stocks pay enticingly rich dividends  That s because  like gambling and adult entertainment  tobacco and alcohol stocks fall into a stigmatized niche of the investment universe known as  sin stocks  Because of the social stigma attached to sin stocks  many endowments and pension funds shy away from owning them  Few institutional holders help to keep the prices of these stocks reasonable and dividend yields high  The fact that sin stocks often have all the best characteristics of a value stock makes these excellent long term investments    Here are four sin stocks whose steady performance and generous yields are nothing to be ashamed of      1  AmBev  NYSE  ABV  Yield  4  AmBev is the leading brewer in Canada  Brazil and most of Latin America  Its portfolio of globally recognized brands includes Brahma  Skol  Antarctica  Quilmes  Labatt  Pilsen and Pacena  This company is benefiting from the rise of a middle class in Latin America and the increasing appetite of these consumers for premium beers    AmBev is owned by the much larger Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE  BUD   but trades separately as an American depositary receipt  ADR   The company has more cash than debt and generates enormous cash flow totaling  6 8 billion during the past 12 months    Return on equity is impressive at 34   and earnings and dividend growth are reliable  In the past five years  AmBev has produced 17  yearly earnings per share  EPS  growth and 36  annual dividend growth  Payout is reasonable at 43  of cash flow  AmBev currently pays a  1 44 annual dividend that yields almost 4   2  Altria Group  NYSE  MO  Yield  5   Altria Group owns Phillip Morris and Marlboro brand cigarettes  which is the United States  top selling brand  with a greater than 40  market share  The company also owns smokeless tobacco brands Skoal and Copenhagen  Chateau Ste  Michelle and Columbia Crest brand wines  as well as a 27  stake in brewer SABMiller  which owns the Miller and Coors beer brands    Altria Group plans to grow profits by repositioning its premium cigarette brand for long term growth  The company launched its new Marlboro Black brand in December and has already garnered a 1  market share  Altria Group is also stepping up investment in new smokeless tobacco products  while reducing overall costs  A new restructuring program is expected to trim  400 million from annual expenses next year    The company anticipates delivering 6  9  earnings growth this year and targets long term earnings growth averaging 7  9  annually  Payout targeted at 80  means dividends should grow roughly in line with earnings  Although recent dividend increases have been erratic  Altria Group has raised dividends 45 times in 42 years  The last was an 8  hike in August 2011 to a  1 64 annual rate  good for a yield of roughly 5      3  British American Tobacco plc  NYSE  BTI  Yield  6   British American Tobacco  BAT  is the world s second largest tobacco company  with a 38  global market share  The company s four global brands    Dunhill  Kent  Lucky Strike and Pall Mall    cover the premium and value priced segments  which grew by 8 5  last year    BAT enjoys broad exposure to emerging markets  which account for 60  of profits  While tobacco use has been steadily waning in Western countries  it is on the rise in Asia and Africa    In the past five years  BAT has improved earnings 11  a year and raised dividends at an 18  annual pace  The company is hugely profitable and boasts a trailing 12 month return on equity of 37 5   Cash flow is also robust at  9 2 billion  nearly twice the amount of stated earnings the company has posted during the past two years    BAT is also less volatile than the overall market  Shares carry a beta value of less than 0 5  meaning it is half as volatile as the broader market  BAT pays dividends twice a year  with payout at 65  of earnings  The last dividend increase was in February to a new forward annualized rate of  5 71  yielding almost 6     4  Reynolds American Inc   NYSE  RAI  Yield  6   Reynolds American is this country s second largest tobacco company  with a 28  share of the U S  market  This company owns three of the five top selling U S  cigarette brands    Camel  Pall Mall and Winston    Because of declining tobacco use in the United States  recent earnings growth has been modest at just 4  a year  but the company has been implementing aggressive plans to boost profits by strengthening its core cigarette brands  streamlining operations and entering new higher growth tobacco product categories  As a result  Reynolds now owns the industry s fastest growing premium cigarette brands  Camel and Natural American Spirit   the No  1 value brand  Pall Mall  which BAT makes internationally  and the fastest growing snuff brand  Grizzly   Analysts say Reynolds American can nearly double annual earnings growth to 7  for the next five years    Reynolds has raised its dividend every year since 2005 and this month hiked payments 5  to a  2 24 annualized rate  Payout is high but manageable at 68  of cash flow and the yield is attractive at roughly 5 5     Risks to Consider  AmBev and British American Tobacco are ADRs that pay dividends in foreign currencies  which could bring risk from currency fluctuations  Also  dividends from foreign companies are typically taxed at much higher rates  often 25  or higher  U S  investors can file for a foreign tax credit from the Internal Revenue Service on shares held in a regular brokerage account  but can t recover withheld foreign tax from shares held in a tax deferred account     All of these four companies offer safety and high dividends  but my top picks are AmBev and British American Tobacco because of their expanding and strong presence in faster growing emerging markets  Reynolds American and Altria Group are suitable investments for those who look for high yields and more of a turnaround story  BY Lisa

199336,420852,MO,An Undiscovered IPO With An 8 6  Dividend Yield,opinion,Roundy s Supermarkets  RNDY  is a strong regional food retailer with a local market merchandising strategy that provides high quality food products at competitive prices   The company was founded in 1872 in Milwaukee and operates 159 retail grocery stores and 97 pharmacies under the Pick  n Save  Rainbow  Copps  Metro Market  and Mariano s Fresh Market retail banners   The company went public in February 2012 and has a market capitalization of  454 million   Roundy s generated  150 million of operating income on  3 8 billion of revenue in 2011   RNDY began trading on February 8  2012 at an initial stock price of  8 50   Currently  RNDY is trading at  10 62  an increase of 25  from its IPO price   What is unique to RNDY is that it will pay a dividend in 2012   RNDY plans to pay a quarterly dividend of  0 23 per share   This represents an annual yield of 8 6  at Roundy s current price per share   The dividend payout of   40 million represents 60 65  of net income and appears secure  given solid free cash flow generation   The stock s dividend yield is much higher than any other names in the consumer staples universe  and we believe that this provides meaningful downside support to the stock   In fact  the 8 6  dividend yield is higher than tobacco stocks like Altria Group  MO  at 5 5   Reynolds American  RAI  at 5 4   Lorillard  LO  at 4 8  and Philip Morris  PM  at 3 6   Roundy s is the dominant player in its key markets  with strong market share   Strong local share is critical in supermarket retailing  given the inherently high fixed cost structure of the conventional model   Most players in the industry believe that it is critical to be the number one or number two player to compete effectively in a market over the long term   Roundy s is the dominant player in its most important markets  holding the number one market share position in four out of its six primary markets  Roundy s dominance is even more impressive in Milwaukee  its biggest market  where it has a 55  share  The company s average share in all markets is 35   amongst the highest in U S  food retail  While the company s core business provides no real opportunity for growth  we believe their expansion into the adjacent Chicago market presents an underappreciated opportunity   Chicago is the third largest market in the United States  with struggling market leaders in Supervalu  SVU  and Safeway  SWY    Roundy s is rolling out a differentiated format focused on high quality fresh product at highly competitive prices  Roundy s management team has a history of success in the market  and the company has negotiated a labor advantage with the local union   The company has only five stores in the market currently but plans to open four to five annually   We do not expect Chicago to provide a material lift to earnings in the near term  however  it could be a catalyst within the next few years if successful   RNDY estimates fiscal 2012 EPS of  1 42  fiscal 2013 EPS of  1 50  and fiscal 2014 EPS of  1 65   At a PE of 10  RNDY should trade at  14 20  a 33  increase from its current value   At a stock price of  10 62 with a 8 6  dividend yield  we believe the market has not properly valued its steady income stream and assigned value to the growth in Chicago   Investors should at least clip a steady coupon on the dividend and could see solid appreciation once the company s story becomes better understood ,2012-03-27,Greg Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/an-undiscovered-ipo-with-an-8.6-dividend-yield-118371,118371
