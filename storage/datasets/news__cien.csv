U S  President Donald Trump has set a Friday deadline for the three countries to reach an in principle agreement 
Investors will also be keeping abreast of the ongoing trade spat between the U S  and China to see if any more news materializes 
U S  tariffs on another  200 billion of Chinese goods are expected to take effect later next month 
Investors fear an escalating trade war between the world s two biggest economies could hit global growth and damage sentiment

Elsewhere  the British pound held around the 1 30 level against the dollar after European Union negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was prepared to offer Britain a partnership after Brexit

Other struggling emerging market currencies also drew attention  with Argentina s peso and India s rupee slumping to record lows versus the dollar 
Emerging market currencies have been hard hit by concerns that higher U S  interest rates will pressure countries that have borrowed heavily in dollars in recent years

 NEW YORK  June 8  Reuters     U S  stocks mostly fell on
Wednesday in a sixth day of losses as investors worried about
the bleak economic outlook and technical market indicators
pointed to more weakness ahead 
 The S P 500 has taken out successive lows in the recent
downdraft  falling around 6 percent since a peak in early May 
with some technical analysts looking for a pullback to the
March lows in the index at around 1 250  around 3 percent below
its close on Tuesday 
  We re midstream in a correction   said Nick Kalivas  an
analyst at MF Global in Chicago   The data flow has not been
helpful  
 On Wednesday  signs of weakness came from Ciena Corp
  which reported a wider than expected loss and
forecast third quarter revenue below Wall Street s
expectations  and from McDonald s Corp   which reported
modest same store sales in the United States

 NEW YORK  June 8  Reuters    U S  stocks extended losses
for the sixth straight day on Wednesday as investors worried
that a slowing economy could deepen the market s retreat 
 The latest evidence of a slowdown came in the Federal
Reserve s Beige Book  which gives an anecdotal report on the
economy  It reinforced Fed chief Ben Bernanke s bearish
assessment on growth delivered late on Tuesday  For details 
see  ID nN08248761 
 The market s mood soured when Bernanke gave no hint that
the central bank would offer a third round of stimulus to an
economy losing steam  The Beige Book said costlier food and
energy prices as well as supply disruptions stemming from
Japan s earthquake were taking a toll 
 The S P 500 was down about 6 percent from its 2011
intraday high hit on May 2nd  but was still up 1 7 percent for
the year  Stocks have come under pressure recently due to a
slew of weak economic data  especially in the labor market 
  Investors are re pricing the slowdown after Bernanke
crystallized it   said Jason L  Ware  senior equity research
and trading analyst at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake
City  Utah 
 On top of that   the market was hoping for an indication
that there may be another round of stimulus but clearly 
that s not what they got  
 The Fed s  600 billion second round of stimulus  expected
to end this month  has been a catalyst for the stock market s
advance 
 Many of the day s biggest decliners were U S  traded
Chinese companies after Interactive Brokers Group 
banned clients from borrowing money to buy some Chinese
stocks   ID nN07182221 
 New York listed shares of Renren Inc  fell 13 6
percent to  10 51 and Baidu  lost 3 3 percent to
 120 67 
 Mortgage insurers  shares also fell after MGIC Investment
Corp  reported disappointing monthly operating
statistics   ID nWNAB3825 
 Shares of MGIC Investment  the biggest mortgage insurer to
Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac   fell 20 2
percent to  5 80 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  dropped 21 87
points  or 0 18 percent  to 12 048 94  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  lost 5 38 points  or 0 42 percent  to
1 279 56  The Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 26 18
points  or 0 97 percent  to 2 675 38 
  I think 1 250 is a key level  on the S P  and  if we get
there  likely to provide support for the market  barring any
further erosion in the underlying economic data   Ware said 
 SHARPER SLIDE PREDICTED
 Credit Suisse s U S  equity strategist Doug Cliggott said
on Wednesday the S P 500 could fall roughly 10 percent from
its  current level  partly due to the approaching end of the
Federal Reserve s bond buying program  For details  see
 ID nN9E7GP01H 
  We would think an index between 1 170 and 1 200 would be
a realistic estimate of where we might be headed   Cliggott
said at the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York 
 His comments followed a bearish tone struck on Tuesday byCitigroup strategist Tobias Levkovich  He said major U S 
stock indexes could fall as much as 10 percent from their May
highs  A 10 percent fall is typically described as a market
correction 
 There were also signs of weakness from corporate America 
Communications networking equipment provider Ciena Corp
 forecast third quarter revenue below expectations 
driving down its stock and others in the sector 
 Ciena tumbled 16 2 percent to  20 29  while JDS Uniphase
Corp  dropped 5 5 percent to  17 40 
 Limiting losses  the energy sector rose after talks at the
oil cartel OPEC in Vienna broke down without an agreement on a

14631,236146,CIEN,Bet On 5 Stocks With Strong Earnings Beat Prospects,opinion,"Investors are always hunting for estimate beating stocks before an earnings release  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality and have high chances of beating earnings estimates 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Locate Potential Outperformers  
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to four 
Hasbro Inc    NASDAQ HAS    The company is a global play and entertainment company  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 28    It has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ    The Zacks Rank  1 company is a leading specialty retailer of apparel  footwear  accessories and hardgoods  The company comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 23   
Upland Software Inc    NASDAQ UPLD    This is a provider of cloud based Enterprise Work Management software that helps organizations to plan  manage and execute projects and work  The company belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 33    It carries a Zacks Rank  2 
Ciena Corporation   NYSE CIEN    The company is a network specialist  focused on expanding the possibilities for its customers  networks while reducing their cost of ownership  It carries a Zacks Rank  2 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 1

152922,374438,CIEN,Focus On 4 Liquid Picks On The Top Rung For Robust Returns,opinion,Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into cash  Liquid stocks have always been in demand owing to potential for providing maximum returns However  one should be careful before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level might mean that the company is fulfilling its obligations at a faster rate compared with others in its domain  it may also suggest that the company is failing to use its assets with efficiency Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of more than 7 700 stocks to only four Here are the four stocks that qualified the screen Raleigh  NC based BioDelivery Sciences International Inc    NASDAQ BDSI   is a specialty pharmaceutical company  which engages in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in the United States and internationally The company has an impressive Growth Score of A and

152962,374478,CIEN,Telecom Stock Roundup  Altice Completes Cheddar Buyout  Ciena s Q2 Results   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks flattered to deceive as an initial uptrend was replaced by a steady decline  as the Trump administration decided to up the ante against China  buoyed by the self declared victory against Mexico  The stocks went on an initial flurry as the U S  government dropped plans to impose 5  tariff on all Mexican goods after its Mexican counterpart promised to step up measures to stem the flow of illegal immigrants  However  the Sino U S  trade war continued to brew with no visible respite in the near term as both countries remained firm in their positions   Riding on the success of the coercive tools employed against Mexico  Trump asserted in his usual rhetoric that the United States would look forward to imposing higher tariffs on additional import items to bring the communist nation back to the negotiating table  Although a meeting between the two state heads is likely to take place at the G20 summit  any probable solution is unlikely to be reached in a one off interaction  China has even warned that it is ready to fight a prolonged tariff war and would retaliate if the United States goes ahead with a fresh tariff regime Meanwhile  the technology warfare between the two nations  with Huawei at the centerstage  took a fresh turn as the White House Office of Management and Budget informed the Congress that it would abide by a two year deadline to ban federal contracts of companies that continue to deal with the Chinese smartphone manufacturer  Despite a cumbersome process that involves third party suppliers and contractors  it pledged to enforce the multifaceted push against Huawei to safeguard national interests   The industry suffered another blow when attorneys from 10 states filed lawsuits to prevent the proposed merger of T Mobile US Inc    NYSE S   and Sprint Corporation   NYSE S   on grounds that it would lead to a monopolistic market  The lawsuits are likely to further delay the merger that is already stuck in regulatory clearance  leading to uncertainty within the sector  However  the industry had something to cheer about when the Federal Communications Commission gave a legal greenlight to leading carriers to create tools to block suspected spam calls on behalf of their subscribers  The purported move is likely to offer subscribers peace of mind against alleged robocallers that recorded about 4 7 billion calls alone in May 2019   Regarding company specific news

Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ciena has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Ciena s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past three years  with the number somewhat being in line over the past few months However  the stock s PE does not compare favorably with the Zacks classified Fiber Optics industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Ciena has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Ciena stock in the near term P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Ciena s P CF ratio of 13 5 is lower than the Zacks classified Fiber Optics industry average of 14 6  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ciena currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ciena a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P S ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 1 11  which is far better than the industry average of 1 89  Clearly  CIEN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Ciena might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives CIEN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have not been encouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 12 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined by 2 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ciena Corporation Price and Consensus   Notably  the stock has a long term expected earnings growth of 15 3  and sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   These mixed expectations indicate that while the stock s growth story might be good over the long term  analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCiena is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a top industry rank  top 46  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Fiber Optics industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are

153243,374759,CIEN,Trading Ideas For This Week  Ciena s Stock Ready To Breakout,opinion,"Ciena   NYSE CIEN   built a bearish Bat harmonic through the fall into year end  It completed the pattern and then retraced 38 2  before the current leg higher  During this reset the RSI held in the bullish zone and the MACD held over zero  Bullish  Now the price is back at resistance from August and consolidating  The Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside and turned higher  A positive 
The Measured Move from the prior leg targets a move to 23 70 while the move from the February low to consolidation targets the same area  To really clog things up  there is also a Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern that carries a price objective of at least 26 65  Momentum  Volatility  Classical Technical Analysis  Harmonic Analysis and a Measured Move all point higher and to at least 23 70 and possibly 26 65 
When you get a Mosaic of technicals lining up then you know that many different traders and styles of trading will see this a positive trading vehicle  There is resistance at 21 20 and 22 followed by 22 50 and 23 25 before 24 and 25 10  Support lower may come at 20 50 and 20 before 18 50  Short interest is high at over 16  and the company just reported earnings last week  Their next report will be in June 
Ciena   CIEN 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 21 20 with a stop at 20 50   A straight stock trade

Trade Idea 5  Buy the April 21 24 Call Spread and sell the March 20 Puts  70 cents    The same spread but with some leverage and protection from the large open interest at 20 in March 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  Heading into next week sees the equity markets looking vulnerable 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while Crude Oil churns in a consolidation zone  The US dollar Index looks to continue higher while US Treasuries continue lower  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue its broad consolidation with a short term downside bias and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s  ARCA SPY    ARCA IWM    NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look better to the downside though with the SPY the weakest and the IWM and QQQ a bit stronger on the longer time frame  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Earnings   Technicals

On Thursday before the market opened  Ciena announced second quarter earnings that topped analyst expectations and sent shares soaring in the premarket sesion  The company announced adjusted second quarter earnings of 34 cents on  640 7 million while analysts were looking for earnings of 27 cents per share on  630 8 million in revenues  This is also compared the same period ending last year where they posted revenues of  621 6 million  Analysts currently have an average price target of  23 43 
Looking at the chart you will see that shares have spiked up to premarket highs of  20 25 after closing Wednesday at  17 76  a 14  jump in price  Shares are looking to open around  19 50 so we should see our first level of support come in at  19 followed by  18 50 with resistance coming in at  19 50 followed by the 200 day moving average currently sitting at  20 17  Shares should see a bit more attention today with this big move in the premarket so expect increased volatility and range today as more traders will be looking to take advantage of this big move
