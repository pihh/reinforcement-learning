 In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other constituent  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another key drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA is also not without its limitations and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers

21682,243197,CMTL,Tap These 5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios ,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is by far the most widely used metric in value investing given its apparent simplicity  The idea of chasing stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many investors  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Choice Although P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering value stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as the enterprise multiple  has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers the equity portion of a  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other element of the multiple  EBITDA  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued    EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can club it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry

Zions Bancorporation   NASDAQ ZION   Tap These 5 Value Stocks with Impressive EV EBITDA RatiosThe price to earnings  P E  ratio is by far the most widely used metric in value investing given its apparent simplicity  The idea of chasing stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many investors  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Choice Although P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering value stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a superior substitute as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as the enterprise multiple  has a more comprehensive approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  In contrast  P E just considers the equity portion of a  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other element of the multiple  EBITDA  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially  takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  a strategy entirely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome  But you can club it with other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or

21719,243234,CMTL,5 Wireless Infrastructure Developers Set To Rally In 2019 ,opinion,After performing impressively in 2018  despite severe stock market volatility  the wireless infrastructure developers industry is set to rally again in 2019  In fact  the wireless infrastructure developer industry gained nearly 13  in 2018  while the benchmark S P 500 ended in the red  Moreover  the

China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the field of high tech products  Earlier this month  POLITICO reported that President Donald Trump is likely to sign an executive order banning Chinese telecom equipment from being utilized for U S  wireless networks before Feb 25 So far  the U S  government has imposed tariffs worth of  250 billion on Chinese goods  Most of these products fall in high tech telecom sectors  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of wireless equipment  However  a hike in product prices will certainly help wireless equipment manufacturers Additionally  the corporate tax rate has been lowered from 35  to 21    marking its lowest in 78 years  Trump s tax cut resulted in a huge windfall for wireless operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment  This has naturally bolstered demand for wireless equipment 5G

21812,243327,CMTL,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Ericsson  Cisco  Comtech  Verizon And Apple,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  February 12  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  LM Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC    Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Comtech Telecommunications Corp    NASDAQ CMTL    Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Trump to Ban Chinese Telecom Equipment  Winners   LosersAccording to a recent report by   President Donald Trump is likely to sign an executive order banning Chinese telecom equipment from being used for U S  wireless networks  The executive order is anticipated to be signed next week  ahead of Mobile World Congress  scheduled for Feb 25 28 at Barcelona  Spain Trump administration s plan to issue the directive is part of its core principles to protect the United States from external cyber threats  especially from China  Imposition of user restrictions stems from U S  administration s concern for national security and will primarily target Chinese telecom equipment behemoths Huawei Technologies and ZTE  HK 0763  National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom SpaceTrump administration is deeply concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high tech artificial intelligence  semiconductors  quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors In fact  in 2018  the U S  government made AT T  NYSE T  drop Huawei smartphones from its offerings  Meanwhile Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  was barred from selling its chipsets to either Huawei or ZTE owing to apprehensions of Chinese spying on Americans utilizing these high tech products  This move is testament to the fiercely aggressive stance that the U S  government is adopting in order to protect innovative next generation products of U S  tech giants Recent Move by the US Against Chinese Tech GiantsOn Jan 28  the U S  Department of Justice filed criminal charges against Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technology s CFO Meng Wanzhou and the daughter of the company s founder and president Ren Zhengfei  The Justice Department is seeking their extradition from Canada  following their arrest on Dec 1  Huawei was charged for violating U S  sanctions on Iran and a 2014 civil trade secrets lawsuit filed by T Mobile US for stealing trade secrets On Jan 24  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC that the United States is still  miles and miles  away from a deal with China  On Jan 22  White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow confirmed that the U S  government has rejected a trade planning meeting with China on the ground of disagreements over intellectual property rights A major concern for the Trump administration is that China is stealing intellectual property from U S  companies by unfair means  This is the central point of trade conflict between the two largest trading countries of the world  On Dec 17  federal prosecutors of the Department of Justice leveled charges on two Chinese hackers on account of hacking valuable technologies of the U S  high tech firms In December 2018  several key politico economic allies of the United States such as Japan  the UK  Canada  Australia and New Zealand also banned Huawei Technology from selling its products in those countries Winners and LosersPresident Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry  The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle If President Trump finally bans Chinese equipment from US wireless networks  U S  and European tech behemoths will be the primary beneficiaries  Major telecom equipment makers such as LM Ericsson  Cisco Systems Inc  and Comtech Telecommunications Corp  will gain  Comtech carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  On the other hand  large telecom operators and tech giants like Verizon Communications Inc  and Apple Inc  will stand to lose the most  These firms depend on low cost Chinese high tech equipment for their profitability 3 Medical Stocks to Buy NowThe greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and

goods from other Asian countries  resulting in global economic slowdown On Nov 12  Axios reported that President Trump is mulling over levying heavy tariffs on overseas automakers  The report stated

Continue U S  stock markets have remained highly volatile so far this year  Inflationary expectations  concern of higher interest rate  imposition of tariffs resulting in a looming trade war and several geopolitical conflicts are the primary reasons behind the market instability  However  the wireless equipment industry maintained its bull run even under these foreboding circumstances  surprising many investors Year to date  the wireless equipment industry has gained more than 12 6   outpacing the Computer and Technology sector s growth of 2 3   Notably  the wireless equipment industry is part of the Computer and Technology Sector  Moreover  growth of wireless equipment industry is way ahead of the 1 8  gain recorded by the benchmark S P 500 index Strong Wireless Infrastructure MarketWith rapid growth in video and other bandwidth intensive applications  the wireless industry participants are making considerable investments in LTE  broadband and fiber in order to provide additional capacity and ramp up Internet and wireless networks  The LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 91  in the North American region  This in turn will help wireless

prices of wireless equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector  However  a hike in product prices will certainly help wireless equipment manufacturers Performance of Major Wireless

22135,243650,CMTL,Forget Trade Fears  Tap Economic Boom With Small Cap Stocks,opinion,After mega caps frenzy at the start of June  investors again started to hunt for small cap stocks  which had a strong run from February end through May in more than a decade and a half  This is especially true against the backdrop of renewed trade tension and bouts of upbeat economic data that has rekindled the appeal for the pint sized stocks Trade Tension Flares Up AgainTrade disputes between the United States and China heated up again on Friday after Trump unveiled a list of goods worth  50 billion targeted for 25  tariff as previously mentioned  In retaliation  the second largest country also announced that it will slap 25  tariff on 659 American goods for a similar amount and in a similar fashion in two waves Additionally  trade tensions between the United States and its biggest allies   the European Union  Canada and Mexico   are adding to the global trade war woes  This is because Trump has imposed a 25  tariff on steel and 10  on aluminum imports on them from on national security grounds  ending their temporary exemptions that expired on Jun 1  This move has led to retaliation from these countries targeting American products worth billions of dollars The ongoing disputes would boomerang and hit economic growth across the world  leading to job losses  According to the International Monetary Fund  the trade spat has clouded a favorable outlook for the global economy  which is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2011 this year and the next In such a scenario  small cap stocks are less prone to these events and well insulated from international headwinds  The pint sized stocks are considered safe and better plays if political issues or economic turmoil creeps into the picture Accelerating U S  GrowthThe domestic economy is piping hot given the raft of upbeat economic data  American manufacturing is enjoying a 21 month winning streak  average hourly wages have been rising with 2 7  year over year growth  and unemployment has dropped to 3 8   which is the lowest level since 2000 Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  rose the most in five months by 0 6  in April  while consumer confidence rebounded near the 18 year high in May  Per the latest survey  consumer sentiment rose to the highest level in three months early in June  U S  retail sales also rose by the most in six months in May  So clearly  all the latest data points signal acceleration in the economic growth after the slowdown in the first quarter  Further  the massive  1 5 trillion tax cut will perk up the economy and save billions for corporations  boosting job growth and earnings As the pint sized stocks are closely tied to the U S  economy and do not have much exposure to the international market  they tend to outperform on encouraging domestic economic fundamentals Tax ReformSmall cap stocks are the biggest beneficiaries of the tax cut as stocks on the Russell 2000 pay higher taxes with a median effective tax rate of 31 9   In comparison  the larger  multi national companies on the S P 500 pay a lower median effective tax rate of 28   while the tax rate for 30 mega cap stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is even low at 23 8  5 Stock PicksGiven the bullish economic fundamentals but looming trade war fears

22185,243700,CMTL,Will The Bull Run Continue For US Wireless Equipment Makers ,opinion,U S  stock markets have remained highly volatile in 2018 so far  Inflationary expectations  concern of higher interest rate  imposition of tariffs resulting in a looming trade war along with several geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Asia are main factors behind the market instability However  the wireless equipment manufacturing industry continued its bull run even under these foreboding circumstances  surprising many investors Year to date  the  gained 5 6   slightly below 5 8  growth offered by the  sector  of which wireless equipment industry is part of  Moreover  growth of wireless equipment industry is far ahead of the 1 3  gain registered by the benchmark S P 500 index  Notably  in the last one month  the wireless equipment industry gained 8 5  Strong Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U S  economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers  particularly wireless gear manufacturers The LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 90 5  in the North American region  By the end of 2020  C RAN  small cells  DAS and carrier Wi Fi  together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments  will account for more than 45  of total wireless infrastructure spending 5G and IoT  Future DriversFifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution toward 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U S  wireless carriers In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space  Statista s 2018 report on global telecom estimates that global telecom services revenues will reach around  1 5 trillion in 2019 Pro Growth MeasuresThe two pro growth agendas of President Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Telecom industry  The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35  to 21    marking the rate s lowest in 78 years  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment  This will naturally bolster demand for wireless equipment The telecom regulatory body  Federal Communications Commission  FCC   which was revamped by Trump  repealed the Net Neutrality laws in December 2017  Telecom industry will immensely benefit from this decision and will ramp up their project investment  Higher telecom expenditure will eventually benefit wireless equipment manufacturers U S  Tariffs on Chinese ImportsOn March 2018  the U S  government imposed 25  tariffs targeting 1 300 Chinese imports for a total worth of  50 billion  Information technology  telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries which have faced the brunt of U S  tariffs U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector  However  a hike in product prices will certainly help U S  wireless equipment manufacturers Trump administration is deeply concerned about China s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high tech artificial intelligence  semiconductors  quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors Companies that are likely to gain most from the U S  tariffs are Motorola Solutions Inc    NYSE MSI    Ubiquiti Networks Inc    NASDAQ UBNT    Comtech Telecommunications Corp    NASDAQ CMTL    Harris Corp    NYSE HRS   and InterDigital Inc

wireless equipment industry and S P 500 year to date  Bottom LineThe U S  wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  In order to stay abreast of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes  introducing innovative products to gain from the

22208,243723,CMTL,Bet On 5 Top Ranked Small Caps As Trade Tensions Escalate ,opinion,In the latest edition of the drama on trade and tariffs  President Trump upped the ante against traditional U S  allies on Monday  In a series of tweets  he attacked Canada and European trading partners  accusing them of heavy tariffs on U S  products  Trump s recent statements followed his refusal to endorse a G 7 joint statement backing all round tariff cuts With trade related tensions refusing to die down  small cap stocks are looking like an increasingly attractive proposition  Their domestic focus insulates them from a variety of external risk factors  Additionally  these are likely to benefit the most from the Trump administration s tax cuts  Adding them to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point  Refusal to Back G 7 StatementSpeaking at the G 7 summit in Canada on Jun 9  Trump said that trade between member countries should be free from tariff and non tariff barriers  Initially  statements of this nature struck the right chord with other G 7 members  But Trump refused to specify how the United States would slash its tariff barriers Instead  he raised the issue of stiff duties imposed by Canada on U S  dairy products  Further  he again demanded that Russia be reinstated as a member of the G 8  This is a contentious demand given that Russia was ejected from this group after it annexed Crimea in 2014  Despite such points of discord  it initially appeared that the United States would back a joint statement calling for all round tariff cuts  But Trump ultimately refused to back such a declaration  Instead he said that his administration would likely impose tariffs on automobile imports Trump s Tweets Heighten DifferencesDespite the bonhomie on show between Trump and Canada s president Justin Trudea  serious differences cropped up shortly after the summit ended  Speaking to the press on Jun 9  Trudeau said that Canada will proceed to enforce  retaliatory measures  on Jul 1  following the U S  decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum Trudeau also emphasized that though Canada was polite  it would  not be pushed around   The Trump administration seemed to take umbrage to Trudeau s comments with Trump s chief economic adviser calling it a  betrayal  on Jun 10  This was followed by a series of tweets by Trump in which he attacked Canada and other U S  allies  Taking offence to his statement that tariffs imposed by the United States were  kind of insulting   the U S  President said Trudeau was  dishonest and weak   Through his tweets  Trump placed a cloud on trading ties between the United States and its traditional allies  According to him   Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal   He also asserted that the United States bears the bulk of NATO costs in order to protect countries  that rip us off on Trade  Our ChoicesThe events at the G 7 summit  and immediately after  show that trade relations between the United States and its allies are likely to worsen  Trump shows no signs of relenting on the tariff front  Meanwhile  traditional allies like Canada are toughening their stance following the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum  For investors  small cap stocks look like the best option at this point  Their domestic focus protects them from a range of external risks  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult  This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a

22211,243726,CMTL,AT T Wins Government Lawsuit  Seals Time Warner Merger Deal ,opinion,AT T Inc    NYSE T   has received green signal from the court to go ahead with its proposed deal to buy the mass media and entertainment conglomerate  Time Warner   NYSE TWX   for  85 billion  This historic judgement marks the annulment of a sensational government lawsuit in favor of one of the biggest merger deals in the history of the United States  The deal is expected to be closed before the agreement deadline of Jun 21  2018 The Department of Justice   DOJ    which represented the government  argued that the deal will increase market concentration  decrease competition and lead to higher prices for TV programs and videos  disrupting the equilibrium of the market as a whole  However  District Judge Richard Leon refuted these claims arguing that the government failed to furnish enough evidence to back them  The government s evaluation of the merger was based on the hypothesis that AT T will be empowered to charge higher fees from pay TV distributors  failing which  it could withhold key channels like CNN and TNT  This power will also allow the company to raise prices of its own network  taking advantage of the fact that the most popular programs and games will be broadcasted via its own satellites  However  AT T countered the claims arguing that this would cause grave economic impact and damage business in the long run  It also promised that there will be zero or minimal  about 45 cents per month per customer  price hikes  or disruption in the television market competition Political TwistAT T proposed to buy Time Warner back in October 2016  following which  the merger gained the approval of Time Warner shareholders  European Commission  Mexican  Chilean and Brazilian authorities in succession  The United States was the only country left to give the final green signal  Toward the end of 2017  the DOJ filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT T over the deal  initiating a wave of mixed but strong response within the system Industry observers wondered why the seemingly  vertical  merger was coming under such tight scrutiny  whereas  major horizontal merger talks like the one between Disney and 21st Century Fox were merely awaiting an approval  In theory  horizontal mergers are the ones which potentially decrease market competition and distort prices  making them more vulnerable to government scrutiny   Soon  it was clear that the source of this opposition was the hostile relationship of sorts between President Donald Trump and CNN  which had earlier covered his administration in negative light  The strong opposition to the merger deal seems  to many  a retaliation of the Trump government  even though it had earlier declared that it will conduct an unbiased scrutiny  85 Billion  Is the Merger Worth it Having discussed the political angle to the issue  let us now try to understand why AT T is so keen on bringing Time Warner under its umbrella  In the past few months  AT T has been facing difficulties retaining its customers  With tough competition from Verizon   NYSE VZ    and falling mobile bills  AT T believed that it will significantly benefit from the acquisition with improved media and entertainment domain  With Time Warner s assets like HBO  CNN and TNT  the deal will allow the power packed combination of AT T s data and Time Warner s content to create new kinds of online videos and sell targeted advertisements to counter Verizon s Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and AOL businesses  AT T is already leading the telecommunications and wireless market  The merger will further enable the company to maintain a stronghold in the entertainment market as well  placing it in the lead  Given the scale of both AT T and Times Warner  the merger is a historic one and is likely to reshape the industry dynamics creating a media behemoth What This Means for Competitors and RegulatorsSceptics are wary that the deal will clear the path for more mergers to take place unchecked  which might negatively impact the market  Further  the government fears that the cost to industry rivals will increase significantly as a result  As far as other companies are concerned  most of them are in agreement with this decision  For instance  now that the deal has been finalized  Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  can confidently proceed with its goal to outbid Disney to acquire 21st Century Fox How Investors are ReactingFollowing the victory  share price of Times Warner rose more than 5   However  AT T fell about 1 3  due to reasons like premium paid to Time Warner shareholders over the market price  Share price of companies expected to be acquired also shot up  leading to price of potential acquiring companies to fall  For instance  shares of Fox rose 7  and that of Comcast and Disney dropped 4 3  and 1 8   respectively Price PerformanceThe stock has underperformed the  in the past year with an average loss of 11 3  against a decline of 8 1  for the latter  It remains to be seen whether such a game changing deal can turn the tables and boost the shares of the company Zacks Rank   Stock to ConsiderAT T currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock is Comtech Telecommunications Corp    NASDAQ CMTL   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Comtech has an expected long term earnings growth rate of 5  The Hottest

22262,243777,CMTL,5 Stocks To Buy On Trump s China Telecom Equipment Ban,opinion,President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications equipment makers from selling products in the United States  per a Reuters report date May 2  Imposition of selling restrictions stems from U S  administration s concern for national security and will primarily target Chinese telecom equipment behemoths Huawei Technologies and ZTE The Trump administration had previously barred U S  companies from selling products to Chinese counterparts due to apprehensions of Chinese spying on Americans utilizing these high tech products  This move is evidence of the fiercely aggressive stance that the U S  government is taking to protect innovative next generation products of the U S  tech giants However  the move does not sit well with U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports as it will raise prices of telecom equipment utilized by telecom service providers  Nevertheless  a hike in product prices will certainly help U S  wireless equipment manufacturers  That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom SpaceTrump administration is deeply concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of state of the art products in the fields of high tech artificial intelligence  semiconductors  quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors Notably  the Chinese government patronizes most of these big manufacturers  These companies have become serious threat to the U S  economic and military supremacy   China runs a massive  375 billion yearly trade surplus against United States Huwaei  ZTE Targeted EarlierIn fact  the U S  government made AT T Inc    NYSE T   drop Huawei smartphones from its offerings while Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM   was barred from selling its chipsets to either Huawei or ZTE  On Mar 12  Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed  117 billion takeover bid of Singapore based Broadcom Ltd    NASDAQ AVGO   for Qualcomm The government argued that third party entities  especially  Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts Our Top PicksPresident Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry  The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle At this stage  investors will be better off to investing in U S  wireless equipment manufacturing companies  which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U S  tariffs on China  We have narrowed down our

the United States unveiled the list of the Chinese imports which will come under fire from the proposed U S  tariffs  Chinese products which are utilized in high tech sectors like industrial robots  information technology  communication technology  aerospace and medicine will bear the brunt of the tariffs Notably  intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants is the rationale behind Trump administration s imposition of these tariffs  Safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from China is

the country  Consequently  investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative at the moment National Security Concerns Leads to Imposition of TariffsThe U S

delete or add products in the list by May 11  A public hearing on the issue will take place on May 15 Trump administration is deeply concerned about China s drive to unseat United States as the

22407,243922,CMTL,Buy 4 Wireless Equipment Stocks For Seamless Returns,opinion,U S  telecommunications had a disappointing 2017  While the S P 500 index gained 16 91  in 2017  the telecom service provider industry declined 0 73  and the telecom equipment manufacturer industry rallied 12 09   However  the situation started showing signs of improvement from fourth quarter 2017 and most of the major telecommunications stocks have been performing well since then  The momentum is likely to through the end of 2018  albeit at a slow pace A growing U S  economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions  while upgrading plans  The increasing demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment  This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers  particularly wireless equipment manufacturers Major PositivesSeveral positives appeared for the telecom industry in the last quarter of 2017  President Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75  of all governmental regulations during his term as the President  We believe that the telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change On Dec 14  2017  in a landmark decision  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime  There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality  The current FCC s less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies The proposal to reduce corporate tax rate from 35  to 20  faced by telecom carriers would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment   The telecom industry is highly capital intensive in nature  Therefore  the immediate expensing of investment in all tangible  intangible and real property  other than land  would significantly benefit telecom carriers  This would encourage telecom operators to increase investment for capital expenditure  Major proposals such as a pledge to spend  1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U S  wireless carriers  Per a report by research firm iGR  U S  telecom operators will spend around  104 billion between 2015 and 2025 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter  execute full installation of 5G wireless services We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space  According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19 2  compound annual growth rate to nearly  1 7 trillion in 2020 from  698 6 billion in 2015 Growing Demand for Fiber Optic NetworkFiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure in order to meet the growing demand for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are needed by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth  which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G  Dark fiber based wireless backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management  This will eventually lead the company to significantly reduce its backhaul costs  Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells  The increase in adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas Our Top PicksThe U S  wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  In order to stay abreast of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes  introducing innovative products to gain from the industry s growing momentum  At this stage  we believe investors should choose stocks which promise strong near term growth and carry a favourable Zacks Rank  Taking into account these factors  we present four such stocks for investors to consider InterDigital Inc    NASDAQ IDCC    Headquartered in Wilmington  DE  InterDigital develops fundamental wireless technologies that are at the core of wireless devices  networks and services worldwide  The company holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Comtech Telecommunications Corp    NASDAQ CMTL    Headquartered in Melville  NY  Comtech designs  develops  produces and markets innovative products  systems and services for advanced communications solutions  The company has a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets  Comtech has a long term  three five years  EPS growth estimate of 5  and a dividend yield of 1 84   The company holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Harris Corp    NYSE HRS    Based in Melbourne  FL  Harris has evolved from being a diversified electronics company to one that is focused on communications  The company is a global provider of communications equipment and services to government and commercial customers in more than 150 countries  Major operational areas are network broadcasting  network test and management equipment and software  mobile radio networks  and air traffic control systems  Harris has a long term  three five years  EPS growth estimate of 6  and a dividend yield of 1 56   The company holds a Zacks Rank  2 Motorola Solutions Inc    NYSE MSI    Based in Schaumburg  IL  Motorola Solutions is a leading communications equipment manufacturer  and has a strong market position in bar code scanning  wireless infrastructure gear  and government communications  Motorola Solutions has a long term  three five years  EPS growth estimate of 4 4  and a dividend yield of 2 1   The company holds a Zacks Rank  2 Solid ChartsThe chart below shows that all the above mentioned stocks have performed well in the last six months Bottom LineTelecommunications is one of the few industries to have witnessed rapid technological improvement even during the recession  Owing to the significance of this service as an infrastructure product  we expect the overall economic dynamics to shift in favor of the industry  At this stage  we believe that these four stocks with a favourable Zacks Rank are poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities Don t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year  giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more  Those gains  however  came with serious volatility and risk  Bitcoin sank 25  or more 3 times in 2017 Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit

22409,243924,CMTL,Ericsson s  ERIC  Q4 Marks Fifth Straight Quarter Of Loss ,opinion,"In fourth quarter 2017  Ericsson  BS ERICAs  s   NASDAQ ERIC   losses widened sharply year over year  The bottom line was dragged down by restructuring expenses and provisions as the company struggled in the face of challenging market conditions and a major strategic shake up The wireless communications gear maker lost money for the fifth straight quarter  as it posted non IFRS loss of SEK 1 19  1 4 cents  per share  excluding amortizations  write downs of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges   This is in stark contrast with earnings of SEK 0 62 recorded in the comparable quarter last year  Declining sales and severely shrinking margins put immense pressure on the bottom line The figure also compared unfavourably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 5 cents  marking the eighth consecutive earnings miss for this Swedish communication technology and services giant Contracting product demand  lower networks sales  and increased R D expenses pushed the company s earnings into the red  as the Swedish firm reported a massive net loss of SEK 18 9 billion   2 271 8 million   much wider than the loss of SEK 1 6 billion witnessed in the prior year For the full year  the company reported a net loss of SEK 35 1 billion   4 2 billion   in stark contrast to the year ago tally of net income of SEK 1 9 billion Inside the HeadlinesNet sales for the quarter fell 12  year over year to SEK 57 2 billion   6 875 million   The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 074 million  Weak mobile broadband market  shrinking network sales and earlier completion of larger mobile broadband projects in South East Asia  India  the Middle East   Africa dragged down revenues  The decline in sales was all pervasive  with all four operating segments of the company charting decline in revenues For 2017  the company posted sales of SEK 201 3 billion   24 2 billion   down from SEK 222 6 billion generated in 2016 Ericsson Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segmental PerformanceAs part of its recently announced restructuring plans  Ericsson reorganized its operations into four segments  which now comprise the company s reporting structure  Networks  Digital Services  Managed Services and Other  This reporting structure became effective from fourth quarter 2017 Networks revenues were down 14  year over year to SEK 36 2 billion   4 4 billion   Persistent low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower LTE investments in Mainland China resulted in the poor performance of this segment  Also  earlier completion of larger projects in South East Asia  Oceania   India as well as in the Middle East   Africa hurt the segment s top line  The company expects China sales to depreciate for the segment  as network operators in the country are slashing spending on 4G mobile networks after a substantial building spree in recent years  However  the Networks segment witnessed sales growth in North America  driven by network expansions Digital Services revenues fell 9  year over year to SEK 12 9 billion   1 6 billion   Lower legacy product sales hampered the segmental performance and services performance also displayed weak numbers Managed Services sales also declined 7  year over year to SEK 6 2 billion   745 million  Contract reviews and lower variable sales in certain large Managed Services Networks contracts hindered the segmental performance  and more than offset growth in Managed Services IT business Other segment  which includes media solutions  red bee media  iconectiv and emerging business  revenues dipped 18  year over year to SEK 2 billion   240 4 million   primarily due to persistent lower sales of legacy products in Media Solutions and weak broadcast services sales  This was partly offset by decent performance in Emerging Business  where IoT platforms displayed strong growth Ericsson s adjusted gross margin  excluding restructuring charges  in the quarter expanded 50 basis points year over year to 29 9   Higher software sales in the Networks unit more than offset reducing margins in the Digital Services business  resulting in the expansion However  Ericsson s adjusted operating margin  excluding restructuring charges  figures were terrible   it went down from 6 7  in the prior year quarter to 0 7  in the reported quarter  Operating income was affected by higher amortization of development expenses and elevated seasonal costs  Higher R D expenses and significant impact from capitalization hurt the operating margins Restructuring PlanIn March last year  Ericsson s new CEO   B rje Ekholm   announced a restructuring plan to cut costs and streamline the company s focus areas  as well as explore options for its media business  Ericsson s CEO had warned last year that an uncertain market could wipe out as much as SEK 5 billion   600 million  of operating income over 2018  There is also an heightened risk of market and customer project adjustments  which can have a negative impact of SEK 3 5 billion on the operating income until mid 2018 Ericsson also identified 42 service contracts that it will exit  renegotiate or transform   a process which will help improve profitability  As of now  it has already exited or renegotiated 13 such contracts  helping boost profits  Broadly  the company plans to invest in research and development to fortify Networks business  and intends to stabilize its product roadmaps Ericsson plans to accelerate its planned cost cuts and efficiency measures  and focus on the company s core business of selling networking equipment prior to the anticipated roll out of 5G networks For the fourth quarter  restructuring charges came in at SEK 2 4 billion  while provisions and customer project adjustments amounted to SEK 3 2 billion  Also  the write down of assets had an impact of SEK 14 5 billion on operations Restructuring charges for 2017 came in the range of SEK 8 5 billion  lower than the previously expected range of SEK 9 10 billion  Earlier this month  Ericsson announced another colossal writedown  by booking charges roughly amounting to a whopping  1 8 billion  After an impairment testing  the company decided to write off assets worth SEK 14 2 billion  The writedowns primarily affected two of its businesses   digital services  and the cloud computing and media unit  Another SEK 1 billion   125 million  non cash charge was booked due to the recent U S  tax reform Total restructuring charges for 2018 are estimated to lie in the range of SEK 5 7 billion LiquidityDuring the quarter  cash flow generated from operating activities came in at SEK 11 2 billion   1 346 million  and SEK 9 6 billion   1 153 9 million  for the full year  Ericsson s net cash at year end  came in at SEK 34 7 billion   4 2 billion   compared with SEK 31 2 billion a year back To Conclude2017 was a challenging year for Ericsson  Commercial risks for the company have reduced meaningfully due to the creation of provisions and adjustments relating to customer projects amounting to SEK 3 2 billion  Ericsson is also cutting its workforce by 10 000  which should save operating costs Ericsson projects a 2  drop  earlier projection was an 8  decline  in the market for radio access network equipments this year  which is worse than previously expected  The company sees gradual improvement in Networks  even as Digital Services continues to see significant losses Overall  the company expects the negative industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well  Europe and Latin America   the markets with the biggest impact   are expected to have an increasingly challenging investment environment  The Chinese market will likely continue to contract due to declining LTE investments  even as North America enjoys a positive momentum Nevertheless  Ericsson still expects to stabilize its operations amid a difficult market in 2018  Ekholm s restructuring plan will help streamline the company s focus areas  improve profitability  and revitalize its technology and market leadership  The company also plans to explore options for the media business and review low performing contracts in its managed service business Whether these steps will allow Ericsson to jump back on the growth track  remains to be seen  However  as of now  we have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on the stock  as we are apprehensive over the impact of the restructuring and tough market conditions on the company s profits and share price in the near term  Investors who are looking for exposure to the upcoming 5G upgrade cycle or IoT might look at players like Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corporation   NYSE NOK   and Cisco

22421,243936,CMTL,5 Top Ranked U S  Stocks To Gain From Trump s China Tariffs,opinion,On Apr 3  the United States unveiled the list of the Chinese imports which will come under fire from the proposed U S  tariffs  Chinese products which are utilized in high tech sectors like industrial robots  information technology  communication technology  aerospace and medicine will bear the brunt of the tariffs Notably  intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants is the rationale behind Trump administration s imposition of these tariffs  Safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from China is of foremost importance to the United States Further  this move highlights the Trump administration s aggressive efforts to shield next generation innovative products of these high tech industries of the country  Consequently  investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative at the moment National Security Concerns Leads to Imposition of TariffsThe U S  government imposed 25  tariffs targeting 1 300 Chinese imports for a total worth of  50 billion  However  these tariffs will not be effective immediately  Domestic companies and consumers can lobby to delete or add products in the list by May 11  A public hearing on the issue will take place on May 15 Trump administration is deeply concerned about China s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of state of the art products in the fields of high tech artificial intelligence  semiconductors  quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors Notably  most of the big manufacturers of these products are fully patronized by the Chinese government  These companies have become serious threat to the U S  economic and military supremacy   Incidentally  China runs a massive  375 billion trade surplus against United States Sectors to GainU S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of high tech equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector  However  a hike in product prices will certainly help U S  manufacturers engaged in producing goods on which tariffs will be levied Companies producing industrial robots  communication satellites  aviation and a slew of semiconductors will be the major beneficiaries  Additionally  producers of wireless equipment  medicine and intermediate goods like machinery and chemicals will also gain from the move Our ChoiceTrump has given strong signals that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the tech savvy sectors  At this stage  investors will be better off investing in U S  manufacturing companies  which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U S  tariffs on China  Hence it has imposed tariffs on high technology China companies in order to protect the national interest We have

22471,243986,CMTL,ViaSat Looks Good On Solid ViaSat 2   Government Segment,opinion,ViaSat Inc  s   NASDAQ VSAT   recently reported quarterly earnings were  no doubt  hurt badly by escalating research and development costs  and ramped up expenses  ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high speed satellite  Despite the same  we believe the company has numerous growth drivers in place The stock has appreciated 8 8  over the past six months  ahead of the  s average gain of 1 3   Let s discuss a few of those growth catalysts for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock and shed light on some of the risks it faces ViaSat s Government Systems business has been outstanding in recent times and has been gaining even greater momentum  The segment reported striking revenue growth of 15  fiscal year to date compared with the previous year s comparable period  The growth was driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data link products  government mobility platforms  and secure networking products  It also recorded strong growth in cyber security and information assurance products  Splendid growth in revenues drove strong year to date Adjusted EBITDA  up 30  year over year  The company recently launched the ViaSat 2 satellite  ViaSat 2  touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1 and has immense prospects  The company is ready for the service roll out of the ViaSat 2 satellite in February 2018  Per initial tests  the company anticipates to grow its distribution channel significantly  leading up to the ViaSat 2 service launch In flight connectivity is also sustaining robust growth momentum and remains another strong potential tailwind for ViaSat  The company also projects sound growth in in flight connectivity  with a significant increase in shipments and installations projected early next fiscal  It anticipates significantly greater growth early in the next fiscal  In fact  it expects to witness a significant ramp with Gen 2 installs later this fiscal year  particularly on American Airlines and Qantas  The Commercial Air business will likely prove to be a key profit driver in the quarters to come Last month  the company signed a new contract with JetBlue  for both aircraft connectivity and on board Wi Fi distribution  Under the contract  ViaSat will upgrade JetBlue s fleet with its next generation connectivity suite  The aircraft will then have improved access to the coverage and capacity offered by ViaSat s next generation ViaSat 2 satellite platforms ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market  The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve the vast emerging markets in South America  Africa  the Middle East and Western Asia  This should be a key catalyst for the company s operations in the quarters to come ViaSat  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Lately  ViaSat s earnings have suffered quite a lot due to R D expenses  but per the company  total R D investments look set to peak this fiscal year  The primary drivers are the ViaSat 3 payload  pre flight development and testing  and commercial in flight connectivity  STCs and line fit activity  This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters  Also  the costs related to the ViaSat 2 service launch activities and preparations for the large scale in flight Wi Fi ramp are estimated to further burden the bottom line Also  stiff competition in the industry proves to be a major growth deterrent for the company  particularly for its satellite services segment  The satellite services business is also highly affected by seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods However  strong backlog levels  robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential  in flight  and government markets are likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum  In addition  the ViaSat 2 satellite is anticipated to help this company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets Overall  while we acknowledge that ViaSat has a robust foothold in numerous markets and is enjoying strong growth momentum  we feel its earnings are set up for more pressure in the quarters ahead

22564,244079,CMTL,ViaSat  VSAT  Q2 Earnings Fall Y Y On Escalating R D Costs ,opinion,ViaSat Inc  s   NASDAQ VSAT   second quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings came in at 9 cents  down drastically from 40 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  Despite only a marginal decline in quarterly revenues  ViaSat s profits plummeted as the company ramped up expenses ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high speed satellite  which was launched in June The company s bottom line also trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents On a GAAP basis  the company swung to a net loss of 24 cents per share  in stark contrast to earnings of 22 cents recorded in the year ago period Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of  393 1 million in the fiscal second quarter  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  401 million  Revenues also declined 1 5  compared to the prior year quarter tally  Strong growth in government business drove top line growth  which was more than offset by contraction in Commercial Networks and Satellite Services revenues New contract awards  down 34 3  to  384 8 million  dipped sharply in the quarter Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues fell sharply  down 5 6  year over year  to  147 6 million  Excluding the prior year benefit of  6 6 million connected to payments under the Space Systems Loral  SS L  settlement  revenues were essentially flat year over year  Notably  Average Revenue per User  ARPU  in ViaSat s residential broadband Internet business grew 9  year over year to a record high of  67 35 Commercial Networks revenues continued to be strained  dropping 14  on a year over year basis to  56 3 million  dragged bylower fixed terminal sales for Australia s nbn satellite broadband service  This segment continues to witness an increase in research and development investment  up 45  year over year  associated with the internal development of the ViaSat 3 project and expansion of its commercial airline programs On the other hand  Government Systems reported impressive revenues of  189 2 million  up 6 7  year over year  driven by an expanding service base and strong momentum in tactical data link products  government mobility platforms and secure networking products  Impressive growth in revenues drove solid operating profit  up 18  year over year  and record Adjusted EBITDA  up 15  year over year  for the quarter During the quarter  sales backlog contracted 1 1  year over year to  1 078 9 million  despite robust contribution from the Government Systems segment However  adjusted EBIDTA plunged 33 5  from the comparable quarter last year to  61 9 million  dragged by start up costs associated with the ViaSat 2 network  higher R D outlay and costs related to planned commercial air ramp up  Also  completion of the Loral settlement affected the company s EBITDA ViaSat  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Other HighlightsThe company launched its ViaSat 2 satellite successfully in the fiscal first quarter  ViaSat 2  touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1 Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat 1 include high capacity connectivity  smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways  ViaSat believes these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points  delivering greater network reliability and security ViaSat maintains a leading position in the satellite and wireless communications market  The company has garnered enough economics of scale and scope to serve vast emerging markets in South America  Africa  the Middle East and Western Asia  ViaSat 2 services are expected to begin in fourth quarter fiscal 2018 The company has also been investing in the next generation of ViaSat 3 class satellites   which will provide even more bandwidth globally from satellites slated to launch starting in 2019 LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of  242 7 million compared with  130 1 million as of Mar 31  2017  The company also generated strong operating cash flow in the fiscal first half  which hit  186 million  in spite of the uptick in R D outlay  and the  23 million costs related to ViaSat 2 and commercial air ramping costs To ConcludeViaSat posted mixed results for the reported quarter  Strong backlog levels  robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential  in flight  and government markets are likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum  In addition  the just launched ViaSat 2 satellite is likely to help the company fortify its foothold in new geographic markets Despite these positives  escalating research and development costs remain a major concern for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company in the near term  Furthermore  the company s satellite services segment is highly affected by the seasonality of demand due to traditional retail selling periods Despite such headwinds  increasing adoption of satellite networking  in flight Wi Fi services in commercial aircraft data links and encryption product based businesses are anticipated to drive the company s long term growth  We also believe the collaboration with Eutelsat is a strategic fit for ViaSat to embark on a global expansion drive Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the same space include Ubiquiti Networks  Inc    NASDAQ UBNT    Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI   and Comtech

22566,244081,CMTL,Government Prospects  ViaSat 2 To Drive Growth For ViaSat,opinion,ViaSat Inc  s   NASDAQ VSAT   earnings in the recently reported quarterly results were  no doubt  hurt badly by

recently launched the ViaSat 2 satellite  ViaSat 2  touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1 and has immense prospects  The company is ready for the service launch of the ViaSat 2 satellite in coming February Per initial tests  the company anticipates to grow its distribution channel significantly  leading up to the ViaSat

due to R D expenses  but per the company  total R D investments look set to peak this fiscal year  The primary drivers are the ViaSat 3 payload  pre flight development and testing  and commercial in flight connectivity  STCs and line fit activity  This indicates that we can see more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters  Also  the costs related to the ViaSat 2 service launch activities and

22567,244082,CMTL,4 Best Performing Wireless Equipment Stocks In 2017,opinion,"The telecommunications industry is witnessing rapid technological improvement  Unprecedented growth in high speed mobile Internet traffic  particularly with respect to wireless data and video  has transformed this industry into the most evolving  inventive and keenly contested space 
A growing economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecommunication industry in an otherwise tough environment  This in turn has given a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers  particularly wireless equipment manufacturers 
Wireless Is the Key
Wireless networks are key to the growth of the overall telecom industry  Wireless network standards are continuously evolving worldwide in order to provide faster speed  Long Term Evolution  LTE   the most sought after super fast  4G  wireless communications technology  is gaining rapid momentum  Following significant deployment of 4G LTE networks  LTE A  Long Term Evolution Advanced  wireless networks are gradually finding a solid foothold 
Per a report by research firm iGR  U S  telecom operators will spend around  104 billion during 2015   2025 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to the upcoming 5G standards and thereafter  execute full installation of 5G wireless services  This bodes well for wireless equipment manufacturers with enormous opportunity to grow 
We expect wireless networks to provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space  According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide spending on IoT will grow at 19 2  compound annual growth rate to nearly  1 7 trillion in 2020 from  698 6 billion in 2015  Exponential growth of Internet connected devices will be a major boom for wireless equipment manufacturers 
Massive Spectrum Deployment by Carriers
As wireless networks run on radio frequency  spectrums  airwaves  have become the most sought after commodity in the industry  T Mobile US has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low band airwaves  In 2018  AT T  NYSE T  will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project 
Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA   the new entrant in the wireless field  acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC  We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage 
The market for U S  public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive  AT T will install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to the country s police  firefighters and emergency medical services 
The company is expected to spend around  40 billion over the life of the contract to build  deploy  operate and maintain the network  Moreover  Verizon has announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers  The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks  RANs  deployed by FirstNet 
Strong Growth of Service Provider Routers
Massive growth in mobile device usage has heightened transportation of data traffic substantially  In order to manage this burgeoning demand for photo  video and online data services  telecom operators are required to install more routers to ensure smooth transfer of data packets 
Routers are telecom infrastructure devices used to deliver data packets from one network to another  These are located at gateways  places where two or more networks connect  Per the IDC estimate  in 2017  the aggregate market size of the service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch will surpass the 2016 figure of over  13 billion 
The success is primarily attributed to strong demand from cloud service providers and the digital transformation imperative  In the United States  the majority of demand for service provider router and carrier Ethernet switch are from large cloud service operators like Amazon Web Services of Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN    Microsoft Azure of Microsoft Corp  NASDAQ MSFT   and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc 
Our Top Pick
The U S  wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  In order to stay abreast of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes  introducing innovative products to gain from the industry s growing momentum
