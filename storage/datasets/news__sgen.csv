111661,333176,SGEN,Drug developers take fresh aim at  guided missile  cancer drugs,news,"By Ludwig Burger and John Miller
FRANKFURT ZURICH  Reuters    Dozens of drugmakers are conducting human trials for a record 89 therapies that pair antibodies with toxic agents to fight cancer  evidence of renewed confidence in an approach that has long fallen short of its promise  an analysis compiled for Reuters shows 
These antibody drug conjugates  or ADCs  from companies including AztraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline  are described by researchers as  guided missiles  packing a powerful anti cancer punch 
They are engineered to zero in on tumors and then release cytotoxins that deliver up to 10 000 times the potency of standard chemotherapy  while minimizing damage to healthy tissue 
The approach has for decades been a major biotech industry focus  Many experimental ADCs  however  failed due to the complexity of pairing the right antibody with the appropriate toxic agent  Some were abandoned as too weak  others were too harmful 
From 2000 to 2018  only five ADCs won approval  Just one  Roche s  S ROG  Kadcyla  approved in 2013 for breast cancer  has surpassed  1 billion in annual sales after data last year showed it boosted disease free survival for some patients compared with the standard treatment  Roche s Herceptin 
Over time  however  scientists devised better ways to connect payloads and antibodies and more precisely reach tumors  There is a growing understanding  too  of how to design ADCs to kill even surrounding cancer cells that previously evaded destruction 
 What we re seeing now are the benefits of the science becoming mature   said ADC pioneer Chris Martin  CEO of Switzerland s ADC Therapeutics  N ADCT    It took at least a decade  probably more like 15 years  to really begin to turn the art into a science  
In 2019  U S  regulators approved three ADCs  the most ever in a single year  as last ditch treatments based on studies showing they helped patients whose survival outlook was bleak 
They include AstraZeneca s  L AZN  and Daiichi Sankyo s  T 4568  breast cancer drug  Enhertu  which was shown to help patients who had failed numerous previous treatments survive a median of more than 16 months before their disease worsened 
Astellas   T 4503  and Seattle Genetics   O SGEN  bladder cancer drug  Padcev  also received expedited approval in December  based on evidence that 44  of patients who had failed immunotherapy showed improvement  and in some cases  no evidence of cancer  when they were assessed after treatment 
Roche s  S ROG  Polivy was green lighted against lymphoma in June after producing complete response rates  with no signs of disease  in 40  of patients when combined with two other therapies 
NEW RECORD
While all three drugs must prove their mettle in further studies  the industry is growing optimistic that ADCs  time may have arrived 
The number of ADC drug candidates is at unprecedented levels  according to data from consultancy Beacon Targeted Therapies compiled for Reuters  based on a review of companies  pipelines  Dozens more ADC prospects are in pre clinical review 
London based Beacon advises drugmakers on targeted therapies  helping them decide whether to pursue prospective drugs or redirect efforts  based on industry trends 
Current ADC projects include GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK  testing its belantamab mafodotin against multiple myeloma 
ADC Therapeutics  part owned by private equity firm Auven Therapeutics  has several studies on experimental drugs  including with Danish partner  Genmab   CO GMAB   on blood cancers and solid tumors 
U S  biotech Immunomedics   O IMMU  market capitalization gained more than 60  to  4 3 billion in the last six months  ahead of the U S  Food and Drug Administration s late December decision to review its ADC against triple negative breast cancer  which is hard to treat and has poor prognosis 
Massachusetts based  ImmunoGen   O IMGN   hit by past trial failures  got a lift in December for its ADC against ovarian cancer when the FDA indicated it may become a candidate for accelerated approval 
The surge in ADC investment has been fueled  in part  by improvements in the so called  linker  technology that binds the antibody to its cancer killing toxins  keeping them stable in the circulatory system until the poison can be unleashed on the targeted tumour 
ADCs are generally delivered via repeated infusions  similar to chemotherapy 
 There is a revival again because there is a new generation of molecules in which the linker is more efficient   Giuseppe Curigliano  clinical director of early drug development at Milan s European Institute of Oncology  told Reuters 
BETTING ON GROWTH
This optimism has contract manufacturers like Merck KGaA  DE MRCG  and Lonza  S LONN  ramping up facilities  in hopes drugmakers will farm out complex ADC production 
Merck expects the overall ADC market to grow by more than 20  in coming years  boosting its business  which includes manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents 
Rival Lonza  which helps make Roche s two ADCs and sees annual 9  growth for the so called bioconjugates market  is investing millions of dollars in its Swiss site  where it produces ADCs for other drugmakers 
 What we see over time at Lonza is a good request for capacity   said Iwan Bertholjotti  Lonza s bioconjugate commercial development head   That s a good sign that the market is booming

GRAPHIC  ADC clinical development 
Still  enthusiasm is not universal 
AbbVie  N ABBV  in August abandoned its ADC candidate Rova T after flunking a lung cancer trial and wrote off most of the  5 8 billion it paid for the drug s developer  Stemcentrx  in 2016 
Roche  which helped pioneer ADCs with Kadcyla and Polivy  has also backed off  In 2013  the Basel based company had about a dozen experimental ADCs  Today  only one remains  and it is being developed for Staph infections  not cancer 
 We have shifted our technology priorities   Roche CEO Severin Schwan told Reuters   Maybe others will be luckier  but we failed to master the complexity  
AstraZeneca aims to do just that 
In March  the Cambridge  England based drugmaker struck a  7 billion deal with Japan s Daiichi Sankyo for rights to Enhertu  getting  1 35 billion up front  and more if it challenges Roche drugs  dominance in breast cancer 
Some industry analysts see Enhertu sales eventually reaching up to  7 billion annually 
 Our plan is to expand the number of studies in different tumor types   said Gilles Gallant  head of oncology R D at Daiichi Sankyo   This agent has potential  ",2020-01-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/drug-developers-take-fresh-aim-at-guidedmissile-cancer-drugs-2052907,2052907

111759,333274,SGEN,Biotech Stock Roundup  Regeneron Impresses In Q4  Gilead Slumps  MacroGenics Soars ,opinion,"It was a busy week for the biotech sector  Apart from earnings  regular pipeline updates and data read outs were also in the news  Key among them include   bigwig Gilead Sciences  phase III study on liver disease drug fails while Regeneron cuts the price of its PCSK9 inhibitor to make it more affordable 
Recap of the Week s Top Stories 
Earnings in Focus  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ REGN   delivered impressive results in the fourth quarter of 2018  wherein both earnings and sales beat estimates  Ligand Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ LGND   reported solid results for the fourth quarter and beat on both earnings and sales 
On the other hand  Seattle Genetics   NASDAQ SGEN   missed on earnings but beat on revenues  The stock was in the news as well for obtaining approval from the European Commission to expand lead drug Adcetris  label in combination with adriamycin  vinblastine and dacarbazine in adults patients with previously untreated CD30  stage IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma  HL 
Gilead s Late Stage Study on Liver Disease Candidate Fails  Shares of biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   slumped after the company announced the failure of a late stage study on pipeline candidate  selonsertib  in patients with compensated cirrhosis  F4  due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH    STELLAR 4  a phase III  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study  n 877  evaluated the safety and efficacy of selonsertib  which is an investigational  once daily  oral inhibitor of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1  ASK1   in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH  
However  the study did not meet the pre specified week 48 primary endpoint of a   1 stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH  Gilead is conducting an in depth analysis of the findings and data will be submitted to an upcoming scientific conference  The company is also working with the Data Monitoring Committee and investigators to conclude the STELLAR 4 study in a manner that will be in the best interest of each patient 
The failure of the STELLAR 4 study comes as a disappointment  given the significant market potential of NASH  We note that Gilead had shifted focus to its HIV franchise and newer avenues like CAR T therapy and NASH  given the persistent decline in its once market leading HCV franchise 
Regeneron and Partner Sanofi  PA SASY  Cut Praluent Price  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and partner Sanofi announced a 60  cut in Praluent price in the United States  Praluent  a PCSK9 inhibitor  is approved for use as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL C 
Praluent will be made available at a U S  list price of  5 850 annually effective March  The step has been taken to make the drug more accessible and affordable for appropriate patients  The drug price was lowered in 2018 as well but for health plans but the benefit did not reach the senior patients 
Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
FDA Delays Incyte s Jakafi s Label Expansion  Incyte Corporation   NASDAQ INCY   announced that the FDA extended the review period of the supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for a first in class JAK1 JAK2 inhibitor  Jakafi  to treat patients with acute graft versus host disease  GVHD  who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids  The sNDA for the treatment of patients with acute GVHD was submitted in August 2018  and the FDA granted it both Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation 
However  the FDA extended the action date by three months to review additional data submitted by Incyte in response to the FDA s information requests  The additional data has been determined by the FDA to constitute a major amendment to the sNDA  Hence  the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date is May 24  2019  The news comes as a disappointment for the company  as a label expansion of the drug would have boosted sales 
MacroGenics Soared on Positive Data From Breast Cancer Trial  Shares of clinical stage biopharmaceutical company MacroGenics  Inc    NASDAQ MGNX   soared after the company announced positive data from SOPHIA  the phase III study on margetuximab in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients  The trial met the primary endpoint of prolongation of progression free survival  PFS  in patients treated with the combination of margetuximab plus chemotherapy compared to Herceptin plus chemotherapy   MacroGenics intends to submit a Biologics License Application  BLA  to the FDA in the second half of 2019

111804,333319,SGEN,Regeneron  REGN  To Report Q4 Earnings  Is A Beat In Store ,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   is likely to beat expectations when it releases fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Feb 6  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  Regeneron beat earnings expectations by 12 7   The company s track record is excellent  In the last four quarters  it surpassed earnings estimates on all occasions  with average beat of 10 9   Let s see how things are shaping up for the to be reported quarter Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model indicates that Regeneron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  6 8   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is  6 08  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is  5 69  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell  before they re reported  with our  Zacks Rank  Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the possibility of a beat Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors Influencing This QuarterRegeneron s key growth driver  Eylea is likely to continue contributing to the company s top line growth  Eylea is approved in the United States  EU  Japan and other countries for the treatment of neovascular age related macular degeneration  wet AMD   diabetic macular edema  DME   and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion  which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion We note that Regeneron has a global development and commercialization agreement with Bayer AG  DE BAYGN   outside the United States  for Eylea  Product revenues from ex U S  Eylea sales are recorded by Bayer Meanwhile  Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea s label into additional indications  which should further boost sales   In August 2018  the FDA approved a 12 week dosing interval of Eylea injection in patients with wet age related macular degeneration  wet AMD  based on physician s assessment  The FDA also accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  of Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy  with a target action date of May 13  2019 Apart from Eylea s performance and label expansion efforts  investors will be focussing on the uptake of Dupixent Strong Dupixent sales drove Regeneron s impressive sales in the first nine months of 2018 and we expect the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter as well  The uptake of the drug has been strong after it obtained approval last year for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   The company and partner Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  are also working to expand Dupixent s label  which should diversify the company s revenue base and reduce dependence on the lead drug  The FDA has accepted for priority review the sBLA for AD in adolescent patients and set a target action date of Mar 11  2019 Kevzara  an anti interleukin  IL  6 receptor monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  was approved by the FDA in May 2017  The uptake of the drug has been encouraging so far The company has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for both the drugs  The company updated its projection for collaboration revenues along with the announcement of third quarter results  Collaboration revenues from Sanofi are now projected around  430  455 million compared with the previous guidance of  455  485 million  Both the companies have restructured their existing global Immuno oncology Discovery and Development Agreement for new immuno oncology cancer treatments  The original agreement  which was signed in 2015  is scheduled to end around mid 2020 Hence  the companies have revised the agreement and selected two clinical stage bispecific antibody programs for further development  Per the revised agreement  Regeneron will retain all rights to its other immuno oncology discovery and development programs  Sanofi can advance its early stage immuno oncology pipeline independently Meanwhile  Regeneron is working to expand its portfolio pipeline  In September 2018  the FDA approved Libtayo for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation  The drug is also under review in Europe and a decision is expected in the first half of 2019  Libtayo is also being evaluated for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer in a phase III study  which is currently enrolling The company is also working to expand its PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent s label  The FDA approved Praluent for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  HeFH  undergoing apheresis  The agency also accepted an sBLA for Praluent as a potential treatment to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and had set a target action date of Apr 28  2019 Hence  focus will be on the company s performance  particularly on Eylea and Dupixient s uptake during the earnings call  Investors are also expected to await updates on the company s pipeline Share Price PerformanceRegeneron s stock has

Opdivo is approved for varied indications around the world like metastatic melanoma  metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  among others  The FDA approved Opdivo for the treatment of patients with previously treated locally advanced or mUC in Feb 2017 
Concurrently  Bristol Myers entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ SGEN   to evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics  antibody drug conjugate  ADC  Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed refractory or transplant ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma  HL   The trial will being in mid 2017 
Also  Bristol Myers presented a series of data on Opdivo from various ongoing trials at the American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  Annual Meeting 2017 
The company announced data from a cohort of the phase I II study  CheckMate 358 evaluating Opdivo for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical  vaginal and vulvar cancers  associated with infection by the human papillomavirus  HPV   The data showed an overall response rate of 26 3  in patients with cervical cancer regardless of PD L1  HPV status and number of prior systemic therapies 
Bristol Myers also announced encouraging proof of concept data showing preliminary efficacy for BMS 986016  an investigational anti lymphocyte activation gene 3  LAG 3  therapy in combination with Opdivo in patients with advanced melanoma previously treated with anti PD 1 PD L1 therapy  The data demonstrated encouraging activity of BMS 986016 and Opdivo combination in heavily pretreated advanced melanoma patients who were relapsed or refractory on anti PD 1 PD L1 therapy  The objective response rate  ORR  was 12 5  in evaluable patients in the ongoing expansion study of heavily pretreated patients who were refractory to or relapsed on anti PD1 PDL1 therapy 
Bristol Myers also announced interim data from a phase II study  CheckMate 142  evaluating Opdivo monotherapy or in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient  dMMR  or microsatellite instability high  MSI H  metastatic colorectal cancer  CRC    The primary endpoint of investigator assessed ORR was 54 8   The median duration of response was not yet reached 
The nine month overall survival  OS  rate was 87 6  and median OS had not been reached at the time of analysis  We remind investors that Opdivo in combination with Yervoy is already approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in the U S 
Efficacy and safety data from another phase II study  CheckMate 204  which is evaluating the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy as a potential treatment for patients with melanoma metastatic to the brain showed anti tumor activity  The data showed over half of patients  55   experienced an intracranial objective response with 21  achieving a complete intracranial response 
The company also announced results of an interim descriptive analysis from an ongoing National Cancer Institute  NCI  phase III randomized study evaluating Yervoy  ipilimumab  3 mg kg and Yervoy10 mg kg in patients with stage III or resectable stage IV melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence following complete surgical resection   The data showed that relapse free survival after three years was 56  for Yervoy 3 mg kg and 54  for Yervoy 10 mg kg 
In a separate news  Bristol Myers signed an agreement with Qiagen   NASDAQ QGEN   to explore the use of next generation sequencing  NGS  technology to develop gene expression profiles  GEPs  as predictive or prognostic tools for use with its novel immuno oncology  I O  therapies in cancer treatment  Both the companies intend to develop GEPs for several Bristol Myers  I O molecules under the initial agreement  Per the terms of the deal  both the companies will also develop diagnostic products using the jointly developed GEPs and to expand the use of NGS technology with other Bristol Myers  I O therapies 
We note that Opdivo became the first PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy   classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the U S   May 2016  and the EU  Nov 2016  
In Nov 2016  Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy 
Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug 
However  the company suffered a setback in Jan 2017 when it decided not to pursue accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer in the U S  based on a review of available data Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the U S  With the FDA approving Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  for the first line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC  the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share

111914,333429,SGEN,Bristol Myers  Opdivo Superior To Yervoy In Melanoma Study ,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that a phase III study  CheckMate 238  evaluating Opdivo 3 mg kg versus Yervoy 10 mg kg met its primary endpoint at a planned interim analysis  The study evaluated patients with stage IIIb c or stage IV melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence following complete surgical resection 
The trial randomized 906 patients to receive either Opdivo 3 mg kg intravenously every two weeks or Yervoy 10 mg kg IV every three weeks for four doses and then every 12 weeks until documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  up to maximum treatment duration of one year  The results from the study showed superior recurrence free survival  RFS  in patients receiving Opdivo compared to Yervoy 
The data from the study will be presented at an upcoming medical conference 
We note that Opdivo became the first PD 1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy   classic Hodgkin lymphoma in both the U S   May 2016  and the EU  Nov 2016   In Nov 2016  Opdivo gained the FDA approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum based therapy 
Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug 
The company entered into a collaboration agreement with Seattle Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ SGEN    Per the deal  Bristol Myers will evaluate the combination of Opdivo and Seattle Genetics  antibody drug conjugate  ADC  Adcetris in a phase III trial as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed refractory or transplant ineligible advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma  HL   The trial will being in mid 2017 
However  the company suffered a setback in Jan 2017 when it decided not to pursue the accelerated regulatory pathway for the regimen of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer in the U S  based on a review of available data 
Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the U S  With the FDA approving Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda  for the first line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC  the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share

111916,333431,SGEN,Actinium Pharmaceuticals  ATNM  Becomes A Frontrunner To Treat AML,opinion,"Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc  NYSE ATNM  has just seen its position in the race to find a treatment for newly diagnosed AML patients substantially improved  ATNM did get some help from Seattle Genetics  NASDAQ SGEN   who announced that they are suspending their phase III CASCADE study to treat AML  but current ATNM investors already know that ATNM is blazing its own path toward regulatory approval 
Many of those following the AML trials were aware of the potential flaws in the SGEN study  a trial that utilized cytotoxins as a treating agent  which may have contributed to patient death during its 2016 trial  Recently  SGEN took the halt to the endpoint  ceasing the study after consultation with the Data Monitoring Committee  who determined that the treatment may have been the cause of higher death rates and fatal infection 
The bad news for SGEN investors  as well as for patients  is that another once promising treatment has proved to lack therapeutic value  leaving AML patients increasingly reliant on emerging innovation that could potentially treat and cure the disease  With the clinical field shrinking  only a handful of prospective drug developers appears to be a viable contender in creating the solution  However  there is one company that is separating themselves from the pack  based on a credible and innovative method of treatment 
Once again  investors need to say hello to Actinium Pharmaceuticals 
Some biotech investors tend to root for stocks over patients  ignoring the crucial need for treatments that can cure deadly and debilitating diseases  I am not one of those  With the scars of cancer in my family tree  finding a cure is a top interest  The task of discovering the companies that may provide these therapeutic answers then involves digging deep into the technology to find trends in both efficacy and innovation  From an investment perspective  the rewards will follow success  therefore  finding the emerging gems of the industry provides an opportunity for both patient survival and financial reward 
Actinium investors have long compared the differences in the company s Actimab A trials to the trials conducted by SGEN and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   In no uncertain terms  ATNM investors have come to believe that the path taken by the competitors mentioned above is plagued with clinical concerns  Unfortunately  it took several additional patient deaths before SGEN stopped the trial  and now Pfizer is filing a new application to bring Mylotarg back to the market  Those who follow the progress made in the AML sector know that Mylotarg was already stripped from the market in 2010 due to its debilitating and harmful effects on patients  Perhaps Pfizer believes that the FDA may become more amenable to giving the drug a second chance based on the somewhat small development landscape  Let s hope not 
The FDA has better tools at their disposal that make far greater sense than subjecting patients to more of the same from Mylotarg  In fact  the FDA does not have to look far  with ATNM s phase II trial producing consistent and impressive results that position the company closer to an actual product approval 
Can ATNM jump through a few hurdles and be granted either Fast Track Designation or Breakthrough status for Actimab A  With a successful phase II trial  I think they can  And  that s precisely the path that investors are looking for ATNM to take 
The Actimab A DifferenceSome investors are just now learning about ATNM and its active pipeline of promising treatments  But  with the most recent setbacks by SGEN and PFE  it s time for investors to pay close attention to the details  ATNM has several irons in the fire  with Actimab A its contender to treat patients with AML  Not only is it a contender  but Actimab A may now be the sole viable candidate in the clinic  with the therapy being the only CD33 targeting radioisotope based drug candidate currently in human clinical trials 
More specifically  the drug is intended to treat elderly patients newly diagnosed with AML  Actimab A  developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering  is a second generation therapy using ATNM s HuM195  alpha program  To date  ATNM has treated more than ninety patients in four clinical trials targeting CD33  a molecule expressed on 90  of AML cells  Born through a prior study of Bismap A  ATNM is demonstrating that the second generation therapy produces an apparent anti leukemic effect  leading to increased survival rates among patients 
A stark departure from using toxic measures to treat the disease  ATNM is utilizing the radioisotope Actinium 225  Despite the potential for cytotoxicity from the isotope  the company has demonstrated in clinical data that the cytotoxins only travel a minimal distance during the therapy  and therefore  the risk of serious adverse events due to a toxicity profile is benign  Furthermore  because the drug has produced such limited adverse reactions  many of the critics that initially looked at the cytotoxins as a potential flaw in the treatment have been largely quieted 
Similar to the path taken by most drugs approved by the FDA  the evolution of design for Actimab A has proliferated pieces of previous trials and combined the best and most promising elements from each to advance the current phase II trial  Now capitalizing on a clean safety profile and an apparent anti leukemic effect  the commercially viable isotope 225 has become an essential element in the drug s design  The key to it all  though  is that ATNM has found that targeting CD33 notably intensifies the therapeutic value  Actinium s progress in effectively targeting CD33 has opened the eyes of many in the large pharma space  recognizing that ATNM s Actimab A trial is currently one of the most advanced programs addressing CD33  and brings with it the serious potential to become a best in class therapy in treating AML 
Now  with only Mylotarg coming back into FDA focus  the chances that Actimab A gets afforded an expedited FDA review may become likely  ATNM knows Mylotarg well  In fact  the Chief Medical Officer at ATNM  Dr  Mark Berger  was a lead developer for Mylotarg during his tenure at Wyeth  now Pfizer   While I can t speak for the good doctor  his decision to join ATNM is a strong testament to his belief that Actimab A is on the verge of not only exposing the flaws in Mylotarg but at the same time bringing a drug to market that will have superior therapeutic value for patients  Although the drug demonstrated limited patient benefit  few in the industry will argue the facts that Mylotarg falls well short of being a viable therapy to treat the disease  At this point  limited benefit with proven severe side effects gains little favor  and when compared to Actimab A  Mylotarg has fallen well short of patient value 
Targeting CD33 Is The Difference
Now with attention focused on the benefits of targeting CD33  ATNM is gaining momentum in the eyes of its peers  The lagging share price is not in line with clinical results  but those things end up taking care of themselves quickly once supporting data is confirmed  As experienced investors know  it s not uncommon for stocks in the biotech sector to gain hundreds of percentage points in a single session based on compelling data  Now  with ATNM looking to conclude its phase II trial and report results in the second half of 2017  investors are closely monitoring the details 
With valuation being a concern  it s fair to take a moment and look at the lack of consistency in providing fair market cap valuations  ATNM  at current share prices  holds a market cap of roughly  59 million  Compare this valuation to a company like Immunogen  IMGN   who is also targeting newly acquired AML by utilizing the same ADC alpha emitters  and the difference in valuation becomes a head scratcher  It is fair to say that not only is the sentiment disproportionate  the difference becomes more blatant when investors acknowledge that ATNM is in a better position to advance through its phase II and III trials quicker than IMGN  But  investors can t expect markets to be fair  nor do investors expect markets to understand clinical data  It s up to the investment community to figure out these metrics  and that s what creates opportunity 
Significant opportunity is what makes the ATNM story so compelling  To date  the phase II Actimab A trial has treated 18 patients  with the age of patients being 60 or older  Utilizing data from the successful Phase I trial  which treated patients with relapsed or refractory conditions  the phase II trial is designed to address elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML  The trial design is also a fractionalized  dose escalating trial  a departure from the single dose phase I design 
Safety and tolerability results have been exceptional  and when compared to competitors  specifically Mylotarg  it emerges as a best in class opportunity for the drug  The refined approach in the phase II trial is designed to be more responsive than the phase I trial  and includes not only fractionalized dosing but has also led the medical team to hypothesize that the regimen produced corrections in peripheral blasts  in turn eliciting higher favorable response rates from patients  The fractionalized dosing during the phase II trial has likely contributed to these favorable results  and also encouraging is the fact that the efficacy rates generated appear to be independent of patient population or severity of the disease 
ATNM is working a classic study  and their accumulation of positive data may very well lead to drug approval  Preliminary data is impressive  but ATNM still has some work to do before investors can rejoice  Despite sitting in a position that deserves far more market attention  ATNM will need to complete its 53 patient trial data set and work closely with the FDA to facilitate their refined testing protocol  which now incorporates PB burden thresholds in the inclusion data 
By a wide margin  ATNM appears to have secured the enviable position of being the clear leader in treating AML  Their direction is unique  and the science has amassed substantial credibility from industry peers  For investors  Actimab A offers great opportunity to be rewarded by significant increases in share value  For investors  the next eighteen months are primed to deliver numerous milestone achievements 
Actinium Catalysts
The bottom line for most investors comes down to the near term catalysts that a company has to offer  and there s nothing wrong with that philosophy  And  for ATNM investors  the near term is positioned to generate significant milestones  Other than the Actimab A trial  ATNM is well on their way to further success from its phase III SIERRA trial with Iomab B 
Iomab B  a second promising pipeline candidate  received Orphan Drug designation from the EMA in 2016  Investors can expect interim updates and analysis on this trial in 2017  as well as enrollment and DMC reports provided to the market when appropriate  Top line data from the planned 150 patient trial is expected during the first half of 2018  Investors can further expect to follow an ambitious clinical plan  with four simultaneous clinical trials in progress  each offering significant potential for partnership  licensing  and strategic opportunity 
Yes  these clinical trials cost money  and the company s cash balance of roughly  18 million at the end of March 2017 is projected to last through the first half of 2018  ATNM listed approximately 58 million shares outstanding as of March 2017  Along with the stable capital position  investors should also keep in mind that partnership opportunity exists for each of the trials currently underway  and additional value drivers can come from any of the twelve potential milestones expected during the next 18 months 
Drugs don t get approved quickly in the United States  and clinical trials are often lengthy and frustrating for investors  But  keep in mind that while these frustrations exist  ATNM is ahead of any competitive threat in treating both AML and multiple myeloma  Indeed  that s a strong reason to consider an investment into ATNM  seizing an opportunity to generate significant value in the next few months  ATNM management is the first to acknowledge that the clinical programs have taken longer than expected  but they are also quick to point out that the company has not lost a shred of competitive advantage over potential competing therapies  The programs advanced by ATNM are fresh  progressive  and innovative 
Is the sum of the parts greater than the whole in the case of the ATNM valuation  Many believe it is  and they are smart to follow in that belief  At a buck and change a share  the valuation borders on ridiculous  and appears to be more punitive in nature than it is a real indication of the current and near term position of ATNM as it relates to clinical progress on multiple fronts 
At a market cap of  59 million  even a single partnership or licensing collaboration could double or triple the market cap in an instant  For investors  picking an investment timeline is crucial  and while investors may believe that the ATNM opportunity will take months to materialize  they may want to reconsider and act quickly  With both SGEN and PFE all but out of the race for a viable treatment  the opportunity to buy ATNM at current levels may finally and accordingly get corrected

111950,333465,SGEN,Seattle Genetics Starts Trial On Acute Myeloid Leukemia Drug,opinion,"Seattle Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ SGEN   announced that it has initiated a phase III trial  CASCADE  on vadastuximab talirine  SGN CD33A  
The randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial will evaluate if vadastuximab talirine  in combination with Vidaza or Dacogen  can extend overall survival compared to Vidaza or Dacogen alone in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia  AML  
We note that Vidaza and Dacogen are hypomethylating agents  HMAs  that are commonly used for the treatment of older AML patients 
According to the American Cancer Society  AML will affect 20 000 people in the U S  in 2016  and result in 10 500 deaths  Hence  there is significant need for treatments in this area 
The trial will enroll 500 patients globally who will be randomized on a 1 1 ratio to be treated with an HMA plus 33A or an HMA plus placebo 
Interim results from the ongoing phase I study  evaluating 33A in combination with HMAs in frontline AML and as monotherapy in primarily relapsed AML  were presented in 2015  Data from the phase I 33A combination trial showed that 15 out of 23  65   evaluable patients achieved complete remission and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery  CR Cri   Updated data from the ongoing phase I study on 33A in combination with HMAs will be presented in an oral presentation at the 2016 European Hematology Association Congress scheduled next month 
Meanwhile  Seattle Genetics is evaluating 33A across multiple lines of therapy in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS  in various trials 
We note that Adcetris is the only marketed product in Seattle Genetics  portfolio  which has made the company highly dependent on the drug for growth  As a result  the development of pipeline candidates is essential for the company to reduce its dependence on Adectris  Successful development and commercialization of vadastuximab talirine will boost Seattle Genetics  top line significantly

111951,333466,SGEN,Seattle Genetics Takeda Adectris  Label Expanded In The EU,opinion,"Seattle Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ SGEN   announced that its partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited   OTC TKPYY   has received marketing authorization for the label expansion of its lymphoma drug  Adcetris 
The European Commission  EC  has approved the drug for a third indication   for the treatment of adult patients with CD30  Hodgkin lymphoma  who are at increased risk of relapse or progression following autologous stem cell transplant  ASCT  
We note that the EC had granted conditional marketing authorization to Adcetris in 2012 for two indications in adult patients   relapsed or refractory CD30 positive Hodgkin lymphoma following ASCT  and relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma  sALCL   Last month  the EC extended the current conditional approval of the drug  The drug is now approved for the treatment of adult patients with CD30  Hodgkin lymphoma  who are at increased risk of relapse or progression following ASCT 
This January  the EC approved a type II variation to include data on the retreatment of adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL  who had responded to Adcetris but which relapsed later 
We remind investors that the drug is already approved in the U S  for three indications related to lymphoma 
Meanwhile  Adcetris is being evaluated in more than 70 ongoing clinical trials which include ALCANZA trial  phase III   ECHELON 1 front line classical HL   ECHELON 2  front line mature T cell lymphomas   along with additional types of CD30 expressing lymphomas  including B cell lymphomas SEATTLE GENETIC Price
   Both Seattle Genetics and Takeda are developing Adcetris under a collaboration agreement  under which Seattle Genetics owns the commercialization rights of the drug in the U S  and Canada  while Takeda enjoys the same in the rest of the world  The companies are jointly funding the development costs equally  except in Japan where Takeda is solely responsible for development costs 
We note that Adcetris is the growth engine for Seattle Genetics  Apart from Adcetris  the company is evaluating another antibody drug conjugate  ADC  candidate  vadastuximab talirine  SGN CD33A  33A   in a phase III trial for acute myeloid leukemia

Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation  NASDAQ ITEK  made the breakout across the declining tops line on Tuesday that I wanted to see happen and through the prior high  which also happened on Tuesday  It was up 1 57 to 14 57  or 12   Look for a run to the prior high up around the 16 40  45 range  and if it gets through that  look for it to run up to the 19 45 area  So the targets are 16  and 19  
Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ SCMP  has a very  very nice pattern  an explosive move flag  it popped  pulled back and tested several times in a nice  orderly pattern  On Tuesday the top of that channel may have been challenged at 39 40  possibly in the next day or so  and then look for 46
