Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents  Earnings rose 4  year over year The pharma heavyweight recorded revenues of  13 26 billion  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 32 billion  Revenues declined 2  from the year ago quarter on a reported basis  On an operational basis  excluding the 4  negative impact of currency  revenues rose 2  year over year as higher sales of some key brands in Pfizer s Biopharmaceuticals group was partially offset by generic biosimilar competition for products that have lost marketing exclusivity  and decline of Upjohn revenues in China International revenues declined 4  to  6 93 billion  However  on an operational basis  international sales rose 3  in the quarter  U S  revenues were up 2  to  6 34 billion Adjusted selling  informational and

 from the year ago period to  9 6 billion  Higher sales of Eliquis  Ibrance and Xeljanz drove this segment s sales  Weaker sales of Prevnar 13 Prevenar 13 however partially offset the increase Within the Biopharma group  Oncology revenues increased 23  to  2 24 billion  Vaccine revenues rose 2  to  1 38 billion  Internal Medicine rose 6  to  2 33 billion  The Inflammation   Immunology franchise rose 5  to  1 22 billion  However  the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 2  to  521 million  The newly added Hospital sub segment s sales declined 4  to  1 91 billion  The Hospital segment comprises Pfizer s global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti infective medicines Pfizer s Upjohn group s sales declined 11  to  3 81 billion  On an operational basis  sales declined 7  in the segment due to lower revenues in China and the United States Revenues from the Consumer Healthcare unit declined 3  to  862 million  However  on an operational basis  sales rose 1  as lower sales in the U S  market were offset by higher sales in international markets We remind investors that Pfizer s Consumer Healthcare unit will merge with Glaxo s   NYSE GSK   unit to form a new joint venture  JV   Pfizer will own a stake of 32  in the JV  Pfizer had been exploring strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare unit since October 2017  The formation of the JV is anticipated on Aug 1 Performance of Key DrugsIbrance revenues rose 27  year over year to  1 26 billion on continued strong uptake in international markets and consistent growth in the United States Xeljanz sales rose 36  to  613 million driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis  RA  revenues and contributions from the drug s recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis in the United States and only ulcerative colitis indication in certain developed markets Global Prevnar 13 Prevenar 13 revenues declined 3  to  1 18 billion  Prevnar 13 revenues declined 10  in the United States  reflecting decreased government purchases for the pediatric indication and continued decline in revenues for the adult indication  Prevenar 13 revenues rose 6  in international markets Enbrel revenues declined 16  to  420 million in key European markets due to continued biosimilar competition as well as unfavorable timing of government purchases in certain emerging markets  Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen s blockbuster RA drug  Enbrel  outside the United States and Canada Xalkori sales rose 2  to  133 million  Sutent sales declined 4  to  248 million  Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales

version of J J  NYSE JNJ  and Merck s blockbuster RA drug  Remicade  recorded sales of  53 million globally  flat year over year In the Upjohn segment  sales of key drug Lyrica declined 1  to  1 18 billion reflecting wholesaler destocking ahead of the drug s loss of exclusivity  LOE   which began in July  Viagra sales declined 35  to  114 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017 2019 Guidance Pfizer lowered its previously issued sales and earnings guidance for 2019  Revenues are expected in the range of  50 5 billion to  52 5 billion compared with  52 0 billion to  54 0 billion expected previously  Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of  2 76  2 86 versus the previous expectation of  2 83  2 93Research and development expense is expected in the range of  7 9  8 3 billion versus  7 8  8 3 billion while SI A spending is projected in the range of  13 0  14 0 billion versus  13 5   14 5 billion expected earlier  Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 16  in 2019 Our TakePfizer posted mixed results for the second quarter of 2019  While it beat earnings estimates  it fell short of the consensus mark for revenues  The company lowered its guidance for full year sales to reflect the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV with Glaxo and the anticipated near term completion of Array BioPharma   NASDAQ ARRY   acquisition  Last month  Pfizer announced a definitive agreement to buy Array BioPharma for  48 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately  11 4 billion  in a bid to strengthen its cancer portfolio The announcement of the tie up of Upjohn with Mylan hit the headlines  Mylan s shares rose around 13  in pre market trading as this was probably the best option for the generic drugmaker whose shares have been declining so far this year  However  Pfizer s shares declined more than 3  in pre market trading  Pfizer s shares have declined 1 3  this year so far compared with no movement for the    Pfizer expects continued strong growth of key product franchises  including Ibrance  Eliquis  and Xeljanz in the second half 2019  However  currency headwinds  weak sales in the sterile injectables portfolio  pricing pressure and rising competition are some top line headwinds Pfizer is strengthening its pipeline as well as oncology portfolio  In the second quarter  Pfizer gained FDA approval for tafamidis to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy  for Bavencio Inlyta combo for first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and for Zirabev and Ruxience  its biosimilar versions of Roche s cancer drugs Avastin and Rituxan  respectively  Pfizer also gained EU approval for new cancer drugs  Talzenna  Vizimpro and Lorviqua  All these new drug approvals may contribute to sales growth in the second half Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   Pfizer Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

4066,225581,ARRY,3 Big Biotechs Hold Growth Potential In Second Half Of 2019 ,opinion,The biotech sector has had a pleasant bull run in the first half of 2019 and so far after a dismal period of two years  The NASDAQ Biotechnology has seen growth of 11 5  year to date The biotech sector has always persisted to be riskier than the more stable  industry or the overall  sector as investors are mostly banking on the product pipelines with a very few companies having approved drugs in their portfolio  An unfavorable outcome from a key trial on a promising candidate can spell doomsday for that particular biotech player  Nevertheless  things are now looking up for the sector  which in the past reaped solid returns for the risk taking investor  Notably  the sector has performed better than the large cap pharmaceuticals industry so far  Medical   Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR   ReturnAttractively modest valuations on account of a disappointing run in 2018 sparked renewed interest in the ever volatile biotech sector from the onset of this year  Evidently  the spotlight is back on mergers   acquisitions  A slowdown in mature products due to increasing competition and rise of biosimilars forced most pharma behemoths to target lucrative buyouts in the biotech space to bolster their pipelines   While oncology and immuno oncology are the key areas of focus  treatments for non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and rare diseases also promise great potential  thereby making them profitable areas of investment   Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY    one of the largest pharma giants  announced that it will acquire the leading biotech company Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   for a whopping  74 billion in what could be one of the major acquisitions in recent times  Further  a flurry of deals has been struck with most companies eyeing smaller entities with impressive pipelines  This  in turn  drove the share price value of small biotech stocks  which are well equipped with path breaking technology  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  purchased Loxo Oncology  Most recently  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  announced that it will acquire Array BioPharma   NASDAQ ARRY   for  11 4 billion Another important trend worth mentioning in this dynamic sector has been an effort by leading biotech companies to diversify their revenue bases  Bigwigs like Gilead Sciences  Vertex Pharma and Regeneron Pharma  NASDAQ REGN  are looking to solidify their product portfolio as well as invest in the promising areas of gene therapy and oncology  Consequently  we expect a spurt in the collaborations and in licensing deals as these biotechs look to reinforce the respective revenue streams  Meanwhile  new drug approvals and label expansions of blockbuster drugs boosted investor sentiment and should drive growth in the second half of 2019 as well  Key nods include Evenity  Ruzurgi  Zulresso  Cablivi et al Keeping in mind the above mentioned positive factors  we expect the sector to gather steam further as the year progresses  In such a scenario  adding stocks from this sector will likely aid portfolio returns  Moreover  the  industry is placed within the top 30  of the 256 Zacks ranked industries Stocks to BuyWhile putting investors  money on the biotech sector emanates its own share of risks  we here zero in on the three big biotech companies  which have outperformed the sector so far in 2019 and still hold an upside  backed by a broad and strong product portfolio  Moreover  investing in biotech biggies provides a cushion against volatility in the sector Gilead Sciences  Inc    NASDAQ GILD   primarily focuses on developing drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   liver diseases  hematology oncology diseases and inflammation respiratory diseases  The company has been a dominant market leader in the virology space  With its legacy HCV business facing a decline  the company shifted its focus to HIV business and newer avenues like NASH  oncology and CAR  T space  Gilead is a principal player in the HIV market with an encouraging portfolio of the same  Gilead is looking to transition the HIV market to drugs with improved long term safety profiles  The TAF based products like Genvoya  Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with a strong adoption in both the United States and Europe  The recent approval of Bikatarvy further boosted the company s portfolio  Gilead has a robust pipeline with several development programs currently underway  ranging from phase I to phase III  It has quite a few programs targeting inflammation  NASH and oncology  Gilead is looking to brace its portfolio and pipeline through deals and acquisitions  The company is also looking to expand beyond antivirals into other therapeutic areas  Gilead acquired Kite Pharma to foray into the emerging field of cell therapy  The company has also collaborated with Novo Nordisk  CSE NOVOb  to strengthen its NASH pipeline Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   NASDAQ VRTX   is focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs targeting serious diseases  Vertex  key area of focus is cystic fibrosis  CF  and has a market leading portfolio of the same  The company s lead marketed products are Symdeko Symkevi  tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor   Orkambi  lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor  and Kalydeco  ivacaftor   Consistent positive regulatory approvals led to an increase in the eligible patient population for these drugs  The CF market represents a huge commercial potential and Vertex has been striving hard to further cement its pipeline  The company s CF pipeline is quite strong  It evaluated two next generation CFTR correctors  VX 659 and VX 445  in phase III studies as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor  It chose VX 445 triple combination regimen for regulatory submissions in 2019  If the triple combo regimen is approved  Vertex can address a significantly wider CF patient population  accounting for almost 90  of subjects with CF in the future Meanwhile  the company is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease  thalassemia and pain management Vertex currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   is a biopharmaceutical company  focused on the development and commercialization of life transforming drugs  for the treatment of patients with ultra rare disorders  Alexion s blockbuster drug  Soliris  approved for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS   continues to perform well  The drug s label expansion for the generalized myasthenia gravis indication boosted sales significantly  The FDA recently approved Alexion s long acting C5 complement inhibitor  Ultomiris  for the treatment of adults with PNH  which consolidated its PNH franchise  The initial uptake of the drug raises optimism  The company is working to expand Ultomiris  label  It submitted an application in the United States for the approval of the same to treat patients with aHUS  The company also initiated a phase III study on the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG  and plans to initiate another phase III program on the same for the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder  NMOSD  In addition  Alexion has been quite active on the acquisition front in a bid to widen its portfolio and reduce dependence on Soliris  The company acquired Wilson Therapeutics and Syntimmune in 2018 to fortify and diversify its pipeline Alexion

BioPharma   NASDAQ ARRY   for  48 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately  11 4 billion  The offer price represents an impressive premium of 62  over Array BioPharma s closing price of  29 59 on Friday The deal  if successful  will strengthen and diversify Pfizer s oncology lineup into melanoma and CRC from its existing strong portfolio of breast and prostate cancer drugs  Array s new commercial medicine  Braftovi plus Mektovi is a treatment for BRAF mutant melanoma  the deadliest form of skin cancer and was launched last year  The combination medicine is also being evaluated in label expansion studies for other cancer types including metastatic colorectal cancer  mCRC  with BRAF mutation The acquisition will also bring to Pfizer a large portfolio of royalty generating out licensed medicines  However  some analysts were not too happy with the deal  which they believe is expensive and will not add any significant near term value  Array BioPharma may  however  prove to be a strategic fit for Pfizer over the long term   Flurry of M A DealsAs expected  there has been a flurry of M A deal announcements this year in the pharmaceuticals biotech industry Oncology and immuno oncology  particularly  are key areas of focus  Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY    one of the largest pharma giants  is on track to close its previously announced acquisition of leading biotech company  Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   for a whopping  74 billion  This will be one of the largest acquisitions in recent times Other important acquisition announcements include Lilly s purchase of small cancer biotech  Loxo Oncology  and Merck s acquisition of Immune Design and pending acquisitions of small private cancer biotechs  Peloton Therapeutics and Tilos Therapeutics  Glaxo also closed its previously announced acquisition of small cancer biotech  TESARO for  5 1 billion in January  In non oncology deals  Roche is due to acquire Spark Therapeutics for  4 8 billion per a deal announced in February Speculations IncreaseEvery time an M A news surfaces  speculations are rife about which big drug biotech company will tread on the inorganic growth path next Big pharma companies are cash rich  especially after the tax overhaul in 2017  which reduced tax rate  Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch  large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines  Other than that  sloppy sales of mature drugs due to pricing pressure and generic biosimilar competition  government scrutiny of drug prices and dwindling in house pipelines are some other factors that fuel the M A appetite of large drugmakers The spate of M A activity is expected to continue as drug biotech companies look to use huge cash reserve and combat rivalry woes However  with Lilly  Glaxo  Roche and now Pfizer already announcing decent size buyout deals  the chances of them making another buyout soon are low  Bristol Myers  buyout of Celgene is one of the largest pharma mergers  Merck has been making smaller but regular acquisitions of small cancer biotechs this year Here we discuss three big drug biotech companies  which are most likely to announce the next M A deal  Meanwhile  significant innovations in cancer and gene therapies suggest that the acquisitions could mostly be in these areas Amgen  Inc    NASDAQ AMGN  Amgen has not made any significant M A announcement for quite some time now  Though it has an intriguing line up of early and mid stage programs  its late state pipeline is not that strong after approval of Aimovig for migraine and Evenity romosozumab for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women Amgen is mostly dependent on label expansion of its growth products   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Kyprolis and Blincyto  Most of its mature and highly successful drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neupogen and Neulasta are facing an array of branded and generic competitors  It thus looks in great need to buy mid  and late stage assets to strengthen its pipeline Moreover  the company s strong balance sheet and a moderate debt burden should allow it to expand its portfolio by acquiring or in licensing attractive innovation  It had  26 3 billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of March 2019 Amgen could buy BioMarin or Alexion to diversify into the rare disease market or Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  to strengthen its cancer portfolio Gilead  Inc   NASDAQ GILD  Gilead last bought Kite Pharma and Cell Design Labs in 2017 and has enough capacity to absorb an acquisition or two to bolster the company s value  Gilead had  30 1 billion in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at the end of March  Though its HIV franchise is doing well  it is struggling with sales of its HCV products  The company has long been looking to expand beyond antivirals into other therapeutic areas  It has regularly made collaborations to build a pipeline in newer areas like CAR T therapy and NASH  Acquisition of a small biotech with a great oncology or NASH candidate or maybe even a large M A deal could be in the offing Gilead could also buy BioMarin or Incyte or other smaller companies like Exelixis or Clovis Oncology  Interestingly  Gilead is also widely speculated to be a takeover target Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ  The last big acquisition for J J was that of Swiss biotech Actelion for  30 billion in June 2017  which diversified its revenues in the pulmonary arterial hypertension  PAH  category  In February of the same year  J J bought Abbott s vision care business  Abbott Medical Optics for  4 325 billion  which has strengthened its Medical Device segment  Since then  it has bought only small companies like Auris Healthand BeneVir Biopharmor rights to innovative drug medical device pipeline products Moreover  J J has gained regulatory approvals for 18 new products since 2011 in HIV  cancer and cardiovascular areas  This year itself  it has already gained FDA approval for two new drugs  Balversa and Spravato  With most of its pipeline products getting approved in the past few years  J J looks dependent on potential line extensions of its successfully marketed products like Simponi  Stelara  Zytiga  Darzalex  Xarelto and Imbruvica for sales growth opportunities  It hardly has any impressive candidate in the pipeline and could do well to build its pipeline through acquisition of a company with innovative technologies and pipelines We believe the company also has sufficient funds to pursue small bolt on acquisitions to boost its portfolio  Its cash and cash equivalents totaled  14 7 billion at the end of March 2019 Others Not Far BehindAmong the other bigshots  last year  Novartis bought gene therapy company Avexis while Sanofi  PA SASY  scooped up two companies  Ablynx and Bioverativ  to strengthen its rare blood disorders portfolio  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  is due to close its previously announced  March 2019  acquisition of London based clinical stage gene therapy company  Nightstar Therapeutics soon  Despite the recent M A deals  Novartis  Sanofi and Biogen still have enough capacity to make more such announcements in the near term ConclusionUndoubtedly  the string of announcements in the first half sets the tone for the rest of the year  However  it should be kept in mind that 2018 had also begun with expectations of record breaking M A activity  However  the number of mergers and acquisitions dwindled after the first few months  probably because the potential acquisition targets demanded a premium So  it remains to be seen if the momentum lasts through 2019

4090,225605,ARRY,Lilly makes  8 billion bet on drugs for rare cancers with Loxo Oncology buy,news,"By Tamara Mathias and Ankur Banerjee  Reuters    Eli Lilly  N LLY  said on Monday it will buy Loxo Oncology Inc  O LOXO  for  8 billion  an expensive bet on a pipeline of cancer drugs that target rare genetic mutations and the biggest acquisition in the drugmaker s 143 year history  The price represents a 68 percent premium to Loxo s Friday share price close  which some Wall Street analysts said was high for a company with only one drug on the market that it shares with a partner  Loxo shares surged 66 percent to  232 65  close to the offer price of  235 per share  and prompted stock price rises for a other small developers of targeted cancer therapies  including Array BioPharma  O ARRY    Blueprint Medicines Corp   O BPMC  and  Clovis Oncology  Inc  O CLVS   Lilly shares rose 0 5 percent to  115 28   The cash deal comes on the heels of Bristol Myers Squibb Co s  N BMY  agreement last week to buy  Celgene Corp   O CELG  for  74 billion in the largest pharmaceutical deal ever  spurring investors  hopes of a new wave of large healthcare acquisitions   Loxo gained prominence in 2017   just three years after going public   with impressive clinical trial results showing its drug to be highly effective on cancers driven by a single gene mutation known as TRK fusion  regardless of where in the body the tumors originated  These patients  with more than 17 different types of advanced cancer but all with the same genetic mutation  had run out of other treatment options  Yet some 80 percent who received Loxo s first drug  a pill called larotrectinib  experienced dramatic  often long term improvement   The Connecticut based company won U S  approval in November for the treatment under the brand name Vitrakvi  which is sold in partnership with  Bayer AG   DE BAYGn   Lilly said it  very much  wants to continue the agreement with Bayer  which sells Vitrakvi outside the United States and shares U S  commercial costs and profits with Loxo  Loxo is also developing LOXO 292 targeting a different rare gene mutation  and analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of over  1 billion  Lilly would gain full control of that drug as it is not part of Loxo s Bayer collaboration   In an interview  Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said that drug targeting a mutation known as RET  seen in thyroid  lung and other cancers  was a major driver of the deal  It received breakthrough therapy designation from U S  regulators  which could speed its path to approval  Loxo was quick to take advantage of new technologies that can isolate genetic drivers of tumor growth  and the willingness of regulators to approve treatments across tumor types when a specific defect is present  Ricks said at the annual JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Monday   Loxo sort of predicted that and then capitalized on that in a way that created value   Ricks said  adding that the acquisition will help Lilly identify new targetable mutations  He said Lilly was also interested in expanding in immuno oncology through its own research and possible deals  FINDING THE PATIENT Targeted therapies offer the promise of potentially dramatic results if patients most likely to benefit are correctly identified  and are seen as a potential alternative to chemotherapy and its many adverse side effects   The acquisition of Loxo  along with last week s acquisition of Celgene  may represent the cream of the crop in biotech being harvested by big pharma   IFS Securities analyst David Bouchey said   The size of the deal may indicate Lilly s willingness to pay up to out bid the competition   BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the  8 billion valuation seemed high as Wall Street does not expect Loxo revenue to reach  1 billion until 2023  Loxo s drugs present the particular challenge of finding advanced cancer patients with the rare genetic mutations  which will require significantly increased use of advanced sequencing of tumors  The TRK mutation targeted by Vitrakvi only occurs in about 1 percent of patients with solid tumor cancers  That effort got a boost last year  when the U S  government said its Medicare program will cover so called next generation sequencing  which looks for hundreds of mutations across all solid tumors  for advanced cancer patients  Lilly has typically eschewed large deals  preferring to develop its own drugs  But last year it paid  1 6 billion for Armo Biosciences  a developer of immunotherapy cancer drugs  and said in November it was open to more deals  Lilly s oncology portfolio includes lung cancer chemotherapy Alimta  which had third quarter sales of  520 5 million  Vitrakvi  priced at  32 800 per month  and experimental follow up drug LOXO 195  on which Bayer is also a partner  together could generate annual sales of about  750 million  according to Piper Jaffray   Co   Bayer said it does not expect the Lilly deal to impact its contract with Loxo for the time being  
Loxo s shares have run up nearly 65 percent over the past 12 months  and ten fold since its IPO in 2014  while Lilly s stock has surged about 35 percent since last January ",2019-01-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lilly-to-buy-loxo-oncology-for-about-8-billion-1739054,1739054
4091,225606,ARRY,Stocks   Wall Street Mixed as Fed Meeting in Focus,news,"Investing com   Wall Street was mixed on Monday  as investors turned their focus to a highly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting this week that is expected to pave the way for a rate cut later this year

While no rate cut is expected when the Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday  traders have increased their expectations that it will cut rates as early as July  as the U S  s trade dispute with China cools the economy and leaves inflation below target  As such  market hopes are for a change in the Fed s language to prepare markets for a cut next month 
 I think the focus will be on what the Fed sounds like in the meeting this week   said Scott Brown  chief economist at Raymond James in St  Petersburg  Florida 
 Jerome Powell has got to be very careful about what he says  and how he frames it because you don t want the market to panic if the Fed s going to be behind the curve

4092,225607,ARRY,Array BioPharma Gains On Colorectal Cancer Study Success,opinion,"Array BioPharma Inc    NASDAQ ARRY   announced that its late stage study  which evaluated the combination of Braftovi and Mektovi plus Lilly s   NYSE LLY   Erbitux  cetuximab  has met the primary endpoint of objective response rate  ORR  and overall survival  OS   The phase III BEACON CRC study examined the Braftovi triplet for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer  mCRC  following one or two prior lines of therapy 
Shares of Array BioPharma were up almost 23  post announcement of the news on Tuesday  In fact  the stock has skyrocketed 80 9  so far this year  outperforming the  rise of 0 3  

 
Data from the study showed that BRAF mutant mCRC patients  treated with the Braftovi triplet  demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR and OS compared with those having received Erbotux plus irinotecan containing regimens  called the control arm   The outcomes showed that the Braftovi triplet lowered the risk of death by 48  as compared to the control arm  The median overall survival stood at 9 months in the Braftovi triplet arm compared with the control arm 
Currently  there are no FDA approved treatments available for the given patient population  The data clearly shows a significant improvement compared with the available standard of care options for this patient population  Array BioPharma plans to submit these findings for a marketing approval in the second half of 2019 
Meanwhile  data obtained from the secondary endpoint analysis showed that patients treated with the combo of Braftovi and Erbitux  Braftovi doublet  also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR and OS as compared to the control arm  Both the BRAFTOVI triplet and the doublet were generally well tolerated with no unexpected toxicity reported 
Meanwhile  a phase II study is evaluating the combination of Braftovi and Mektovi plus Erbitux in first line mCRC with similar mutation  The study is expected to be completed in late 2020 
We would like to remind investors that last June  the combination of Braftovi plus Mektovi was approved for treating unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation  The drug combination was launched last July 2018 in the United States and the same was approved in Europe last September  It generated almost  72 million in its first three commercial quarters and registered sequential growth of more than 50  in the quarter ending March 2019 
In February 2019  the therapy was approved in Japan for unresectable melanoma with a BRAF mutation 
Notably  during the first quarter of 2019  the company amended the protocol of the BEACON CRC study to include an interim analysis of study endpoints  based on inputs from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency  In March 2019  the combination of Braftovi and Mektovi plus Erbitux was added to the NCCN  National Comprehensive Cancer Network  guidelines as a treatment option for advanced BRAF mutant colorectal cancer 
Array BioPharma also has immuno oncology study collaborations with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY    Merck   NYSE MRK   and Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Additional clinical studies have started to evaluate Braftovi and Mektovi for BRAF V600 mutant melanoma brain metastases and non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC

4113,225628,ARRY,6 Stocks To Watch  APHA  APYX  CRON  HROW  INS  LCI ,opinion,"Aphria Inc  NYSE APHA 
APHA is one of the marijuana stocks I like to pattern  meaning that it rolled over from the mid teens  down to 3 00  and change  reversed hugely  had a 3 wave corrective pullback reversal bar  ran up to resistance  pulled back  popped  pulled back  it was very quiet Thursday and Friday  and then on Monday  it popped 37 cents  or 6   to 6 41  on 6 million shares  I really want it to get above where it is and break it out to that 7 7 1 2 zone  Once it gets through that  you may see 9  10  and so on  For now  we ll have to see if it gets that thrust to break it out 
Bovie Medical Corporation  NYSE APYX 
APYX popped 87 cents  or 13   to 7 49  on 401 882 shares traded on Monday  This is a Top 30 pick  and is in a nice rising  channel pattern  In a 5 wave advance  it moved up from around the 2 10 area and pulled it back  I m thinking it s two waves up and wave three will take it to at least 10 1 2 in that zone  Looking at the long term chart  it has a massive base  and the massive double top is up around the 9 3 4 10 range  That s going to be a very difficult area to get through  but that s going to be my initial target 
Cronos Group Inc  NASDAQ CRON 
CRON is another one of the marijuana stocks  one of the two I am following closely  A wedge was broken  it followed through with a pop on Monday of 62 cents  or 5 26   to 12 40  on 5 2 million shares  The volume is decent  but not huge  Look for a test of 14 first  then 15  Beyond that  this stock could make a very big move 
Harrow Health Inc  NASDAQ HROW 
HROW  formerly Imprimis Pharmaceuticals  Inc   IMMY   broke out on Monday  gaining 51 cents  or 9 46   to 5 90  on 424 464 shares traded  It looks like  if it gets through 6 00  you should see it run up near 8 00 
Intelligent Systems  NYSE INS 
INS is a beautiful stock  Absolutely stellar  On Monday  the biggest volume day since I ve been following it  it moved another 1 13  or 7 29   to 16 64  on 128 931 shares traded  Right now  it may be headed to 20 
Lannett Com  NYSE LCI 
LCI jumped 1 25  or 21   to 7 32  on 4 9 million shares on Monday  I love the pattern of this stock  I love the base  I think that if it gets up to the 8 1 2 3 4 range short term  and if it fills the gap  we might even see this stock near 11 1 2

4114,225629,ARRY,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Array BioPharma,opinion,Array BioPharma Inc    NASDAQ ARRY   is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective  as the company is seeing favorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for ARRY broke out above the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting a short term bullish trend This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved higher by 14 5  in the past four weeks  Plus  the company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting that now could definitely be the time for this breakout candidate More bullishness may especially be the case when investors consider what has been happening for ARRY on the earnings estimate revision front lately  No estimate has gone lower in the past two months  compared to 1 higher  while the consensus estimate has also moved higher too So given this move in estimates  and the positive technical factors  investors may want to watch this breakout candidate closely for more gains in the near future You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana      Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2019-01-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert-array-biopharma-200377048,200377048
4115,225630,ARRY,6 Stocks To Watch  AMRS  ARRY  EOLS  LCI  LSCC  NKTR,opinion,"It was a pretty good day on Wall Street  Not the biggest day technically  advance declines were solid  A lot of stocks we follow are moving  breaking out  coming through bases to declining topsline and moving averages  So  we ll see  It s getting to the point where some low priced  speculative stocks are moving  That usually happens at the tail end of a move  so you ve got to be careful 
Amyris  Inc   AMRS 
AMRS  which was a favorite of mine back when it broke out last year  It did well for awhile  and then collapsed on a bad earnings report in November  After the 5 wave decline  and a really steep declining angle  on Tuesday it made a major breakaway move  exploding 2 31  or 73   to 5 47  on 54 million shares that took out three moving averages  declining topsline  and a couple resistance lines as well into a gap  It actually filled the gap and backed off  Worst case scenario  I think it will back and fill  set up over the next couple weeks  and then move to 7  maybe even 9  Those are my targets 
Array BioPharma Inc   ARRY 
ARRY jumped 2 07  or 11   to 20 96  on 14 3 million shares  It popped in November  based  consolidated and exploded through the 2018 June high to 21 15  which is the highest this stock has ever gone to all time high territory  Now  I m looking for a move to 23 and 26 going forward 
Evolus  Inc   EOLS 
EOLS had a spectacular session on Tuesday  popping 5 33  or 26   to 25 83  on 6 9 million shares  I gave you this a week ago at 15 90  and it reached 26 37 on Tuesday  I say that s a good swing trade  and a good day trade  in particular  As shown on the one minute chart  it ramped  ran  consolidated  formed a beautiful wedge pattern  and set up for a nice pop  In the overall picture and scope of things  this closed at the upper end of the range  That was monster volume  and I think it s going to send it higher  Targets are 29 and 35 
Lannett Company  Inc   LCI 
LCI a swing trade of ours  popped and pulled back in December with the rest of the market  then exploded from 4 25 to 8 50  doubling  and then on Tuesday it closed up 53 cents  or 6 73   to 8 40  on 1 4 million shares  It just recently platformed for 3 4 weeks and is breaking out again  Looking at the 10 11 zone as the next target 
Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  LSCC 
LSCC bounced just 5 cents  or 0 64   to 7 89  on 589 120 shares traded  This is a nice semiconductor company with new management and products that are selling  It has a massive inverse head and shoulders  it retested a couple times mid January  held the 3 1 2 range  and now it s moved up to resistance  The high 5 years ago was 19 19  and the high last year was in 8 90 9 20 zone  which is where I think resistance is going to be taken out  I think that if this stock takes that out  it s headed to 11  and then 14 
Nektar Therapeutics  NKTR 
NKTR looks like it s about to take off  On Tuesday it was up 1 25  or 3   to 43 75  on 1 2 million shares  It has a nice  long declining channel that took it from 24 3 4  all the way up to 111  and then it came back down to 29  and change  and ran up nicely to 46 for a 17 point pop  This stock had an orderly pullback  formed a flag  held support  and held the trendline  and on Tuesday it popped out of the flag  To me  this might be the beginning for NKTR  If it gets through 49  I m looking for a move to low to med 50 s  maybe even 60 at some point

Caredx Inc  NASDAQ CDNA  popped out on Wednesday  gaining 1 56  or 6 35   to 26 11  on nearly a million shares  pulled back  reached a little bit of resistance  and I m not surprised it did so  The key is 29 1 2  If it gets through that  I m looking at a stock in the high 30 s and 40 s 
FireEye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE  has had a nice base over the last three years  and finally punched through it on Wednesday  popping 1 64  or 10   to 18 49  on 18 million shares  At this point  I m looking for 19 35 6 at resistance  If it gets through that  it may see 22 and 24 
Tandem Diabetes Care Inc  NASDAQ TNDM  was up 2 92  or 8 4   to 37 61  on 2 million shares on Wednesday  It broke a declining topsline with a reversal bar and appears that some resistance remains at 37 70  If it gets through minor resistance at 30 40  we re looking at 37 1 2 and 40 1 2 as targets going forward

4138,225653,ARRY,Biotech ETFs Head To Head  XBI Vs  IBB ,opinion,"The biotech sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately  This sector is expected to continue benefiting from increased M A activities  new drug approvals  better R D and innovations 
Although the sector took a beating last year owing to drug price controls and Trump s plans of tackling the ever surging drug prices getting highlighted in his latest budget  growing demand for drugs  especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending should benefit the industry 
U S  Economy Backdrop
U S  markets recently suffered a sell off owing to fears of rising rates  The S P 500 entered correction territory  as it declined more than 10  from the record high set in January  Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes 
Consumer prices increased 2 1  year over year in January  unchanged from the previous month but above economists  forecasts of 1 9   Moreover  President Donald Trump s tax reform and spending deal might create further pressure on prices  Hence  the Fed is expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation 
Jerome Powell s testimony was seen indicative of the possibility of Fed raising rates more than three times in 2018   In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years  the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE  personal consumption expenditures  price inflation to 2  on a sustained basis   per a Financial Times   citing a statement by Powell 
As such  when the markets are suffering from the anticipated rate hikes  the non cyclical nature of biotech stocks might seem appealing to investors  Moreover  encouraging industry trends and positive earnings are poised to benefit the ETFs exposed to the said sector  read    
Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector 
SPDR S P Biotech  MX XBI  ETF 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to the biotech space and tracks the S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index  It has AUM of  4 9 billion and charges a fee of 35 basis points a year  It has 108 holdings and bears less concentration risk as less than 19  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
The fund s top three holdings are Bioverativ Inc    NASDAQ BIVV    Array BioPharma Inc    NASDAQ ARRY   and Juno Therapeutics Inc    NASDAQ JUNO    with 2 8   2 2  and 2 0  allocation  respectively  as of Feb 26  2018    The fund has returned 31 2  in a year and 5 6  year to date  XBI has a Zacks ETF Rank  2  Buy   with a High risk outlook 
iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to biotech space and tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  It has AUM of  9 4 billion and charges a fee of 47 basis points a year  It has 196 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 52  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings 
The fund s top three holdings Are Gilead Sciences Inc   NASDAQ GILD    Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN   and Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG    with 8 3   8 1  and 7 2  allocation  respectively  as of Feb 26  2018   The fund has returned 11 1  in a year and 0 7  year to date  IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold   with a High risk outlook 
Bottom Line
IBB is more popular than XBI  as is evident from its higher AUM  However  XBI may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio and a better Zacks rank 
At the same time  XBI has significantly outperformed IBB when it comes to performance  XBI has returned almost 5 0  more than IBB so far this year  whereas in a year  it outperformed IBB by more than 20 0   However  investors should note that XBI is focused on providing exposure to small cap stocks in the space  while IBB is more inclined toward the large cap players

4142,225657,ARRY,Will Tinder Gold Drive Match Group s  MTCH  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Match Group  Inc    NASDAQ MTCH   is set to report first quarter 2018 results on May 8 The company has had a dismal earnings surprise history in the trailing four quarters  missing estimates all through  with an average negative surprise of 5 3   In the last reported quarter  it missed estimates by 6 5  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderMatch Group is the world s foremost provider of dating products and operates a portfolio of more than 45 brands  Three of its biggest and best known brands are Match com  OkCupid and Tinder  The company s reputation  established user base and size are likely to prove conducive to the upcoming earnings About 60  of the company s revenues come directly from users of its dating services in North America  mostly in the form of membership subscriptions  Online dating has been expanding  as users from more demographics join the fray  Most of Match Group s users connect from mobile devices  where conversion to paid members is also higher  In the last reported quarter  its average subscriber base rose 24  year over year  driven primarily by solid contribution from Tinder  Match and OkCupid also registered modest growth  This momentum bodes well for the company s top line growth in the quarter under review Match Group has been reaping profits for the past three years and recording top line expansion as well  The company is currently enjoying strong growth  driven by robust momentum at Tinder and solid performances from Meetic  Match as well as PlentyOfFish Match Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Match Group recently rolled out a Tinder Gold subscription package  which has driven incremental ARPU as well as subscriber growth  Tinder s ARPU actually grew 32  in the last reported quarter  Recently  the company also launched the  Likes You  feature  along with a bunch of other optimizations  These factors will drive the results of the quarter under review In the last quarterly report  Match Group provided its revenue projections for first quarter 2018 in the range of  380  390 million  reflecting 29  year over year growth at the mid point   with an EBITDA of  115  120 million for the quarter  reflecting 36  year over year growth at the mid point   The company also typically suffers adverse seasonality in its first quarter  which is usually its lowest margin quarter  Also  the company s marketing spend is usually the highest in the first quarter  which will also impact margins in the upcoming results However  weaker than expected advertising revenue growth trends might dent the company s top line in the to be reported quarter  Further  profits might be affected due to higher investments in Tinder along with higher than expected data costs and professional fees Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Match Group will beat earnings estimates in the upcoming quarterly results  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Match Group has an Earnings ESP of  4 17  as the Most Accurate estimate of 23 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3  which increases the predictive power of the ESP  However  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction

4143,225658,ARRY,What s In Store For Penumbra  PEN  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Penumbra  Inc    NYSE PEN   is expected to report first quarter 2018 results on May 8 after market close Last reported quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1 100   Moreover  Penumbra has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters  the average beat being 286 91  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement CatalystsContinued Uptake of Penumbra System  Over the past few quarters  Penumbra showcased a strong top line performance on consistent growth in neuro arm  It is to be noted that neuro growth was mainly driven by sales of the Penumbra system for ischemic stroke  The company witnessed increased sequential growth on higher procedural volumes  Moreover  the company is actively pursuing marketing strategies  In this regard  Penumbra s Get Ahead of Stroke campaign was recognized as the most impactful awareness drive by the National Stroke Association in 2017 Penumbra  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Favorable Neuro Business Trend  Management seems impressed with the internal efforts to generate awareness in the domestic region  It also appears upbeat about an increased cooperation among hospitals to handle stroke cases  Also  larger hospital systems are investing in to increase the strength of new centers  However  management is little cautious about the growth trend  which might remain uneven in the coming quarters Strategies Buoy Optimism  The company is presently focusing on driving innovation  product development as well as geographic expansion  This is further expected to help Penumbra maintain a bullish stance in the to be reported quarter In this regard  Penumbra produced results from an independently conducted COMPASS Trial and the company sponsored PROMISE Study at the International Stroke Conference 2018 in January 2018  These studies were focused on Penumbra s aspiration thrombectomy system for ischemic stroke revascularization Moreover  we are encouraged by the strong uptake of the company s newly launched 3D Revascularization Device  a technologically advanced stroke device developed for efficient aspiration with ACE Reperfusion Catheters Growing Peripheral Vascular Business  The Peripheral Vascular portfolio comprising Indigo System  embolization platform including RUBY Coil  POD  Penumbra Occlusion Device  and POD Packing Coil along with LANTERN microcatheter is quite strong  Moreover  the company has been witnessing a solid contribution from this segment over the past few quartersand the momentum is expected to continue this earnings season Strong Geographical Performance  Penumbra has been delivering a sturdy performance in both the domestic and international markets by reaping growth boosting benefits from neuro business  We expect this drift to continue in the soon to be reported quarter as well Rising Operating Expenses  In fourth quarter 2017  the company witnessed a rise in operating expenses  We expect escalating costs and expenses to persistently weigh on the margins in the first quarter as well  Meanwhile  research and development expenses increased 37 7  in the fourth quarter  With the company remaining focused on product launches  we expect first quarter results to post high expenses Further  foreign exchange fluctuations and a stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise concerns Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues of  87 8 million reflects a 20 3  rise from the prior year quarter Here s what the quantitative model predicts Per the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Penumbra has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s Earnings ESP of  185 70  leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive as it requires a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement

4145,225660,ARRY,Key FDA Events In June Investors Need To Watch Out For,opinion,"It has been a busy year for the FDA so far with the agency approving 14 drugs  Key approvals include Novartis  Lutathera  Gilead Sciences  HIV regimen  Biktarvy  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Symdeko  tezacaftor ivacaftor and ivacaftor  for the treatment of cystic fibrosis  CF   Johnson   Johnson s Erleada for prostate cancer  Amgen s Aimoviq for the treatment of migraine  BioMarin s Palynziq for the treatment of phenylketonuria  and Dova Pharmaceuticals Doptelet among others 
The approval of these drugs should boost their respective companies  top line as a few of them are struggling with decline in sales of legacy drugs   
Meanwhile  the spotlight is on the  right to try  law as President Trump recently signed the bill that enables drug regulators to allow terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs into law  Per this law  patients with life threatening conditions can now ask drugmakers for drugs that have cleared some testing but have not been approved by the FDA yet   
With the drug development process being a lengthy one and requiring a lot of funds and resources  key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts  Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of June 
Will New Drug Approvals Boost Valeant 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX   has a few PDUFA dates in the remainder of 2018  Among these  the one in June is for IDP 118  The FDA had accepted the new drug application  NDA  for IDP 118  halobetasol propionate and tazarotene  lotion  an experimental topical treatment for plaque psoriasis in November 2017 and set a PDUFA action date of Jun 18  2018 
Valeant is banking on approval of new drugs to boost its lagging dermatology business  Per the company  IDP 118 will be the first and only topical lotion with a unique combination of halobetasol propionate and tazarotene in one formulation for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adult patients  thus extending the duration of use 
The FDA had earlier approved Siliq for psoriasis  The company also obtained FDA approval for Vyzulta  a treatment option for glaucoma  The FDA also approved Lumify  the over the counter eye drop with low dose brimonidine for the treatment of eye redness

A FDA approval is likely as the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee unanimously recommended the approval of the NDA 
An approval would be a significant boost for the company  Assuming approval  Epidiolex would be the first pharmaceutical formulation of purified  plant based CBD  a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana  and the first in a new category of anti epileptic drugs  AEDs  GW Pharmaceuticals PLC Price
 

    
Keytruda s Label Expansion for Cervical Cancer

Hence  investors are expected to keep a close watch on the FDA s actions this month

4161,225676,ARRY,Zacks com Highlights  Cinemark Holdings  Hasbro  Enova International  Array BioPharma And TechTarget,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 14  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Cinemark Holdings   NYSE CNK    Hasbro   NASDAQ HAS    Enova International   NYSE ENVA    Array BioPharma   NASDAQ ARRY   and TechTarget   NASDAQ TTGT   Screen of the Week by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research How to Uncover Institutional BuyingOne of the best ways to find stocks on the move that are grabbing the attention of investors is to screen for stocks with increasing volume This is because increased volume shows investor interest  As more investors buy the stock  the stock s price should go higher But the individual investor  while important to the market  doesn t really have the firepower to affect volume the way that big institutional investors do And very few things can move a stock more than institutional buying Why is that For one  institutions have the ability of buying tens of millions of dollars worth of a stock and even hundreds of millions of dollars  And because their purchases are often so large  it typically takes weeks  if not months  for an institutional investor to build a position Given this commitment  considering it will also take several weeks or months to get out  you can be sure that these institutional investors have done plenty of homework to feel good about the fundamental prospects of the company This does not mean you can ignore your own analysis or the stock market as a whole  But screening for stocks with rising volume  along with prices of course  can put some fantastic stocks on your radar screen What Kind of Volume Increase to Look ForI prefer to search for at least two weeks of increasing volume along with rising prices  And in my testing I have found that 3 weeks performs even better One week volume spikes  however  will not get thru  as oftentimes those can be driven by one day events  Instead  it s the successive volume increase that shows true buying demand  giving this set up its value The volume increase also doesn t have to be huge  We re not talking about a several hundred percent increase  In fact  often those massive increases prove to be turning points What we re looking for are noticeable increases  like 10   20  or 50  increases  etc  But nothing outrageous  like a 10 fold increase  Remember  the last thing an institutional investor wants to do is call too much attention while he or she is in the midst of building a position  But if you know what to look for  you can see all of this happening in plain sight  And get in for the ride as they flesh out the rest of their position And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking

ARRY Technical Analysis

ARRY opened trading yesterday at  6 95  which is in line with the prices of  I trade  and was down from the previous day s trading close of  6 96  ARRY closed trading yesterday at  7 02 and spiked up after market to  7 82  equivalent to a 11  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time ARRY traded above these levels we have to go back to May 1st when it traded at  8 76

For  purposes  I would like to see ARRY open trading on Wednesday above  7 55 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 15 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

Colucid Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ CLCD  is acting great  It popped 1 60  or 4   to 40 10  on 251 610 shares traded  It s right up against key resistance  The prior high was 40 50  and on Monday the high was 40 20  So  if it can get through 40 50  it should run to midchannel to the high 40 s around 48ish  Eventually  I m looking for 50

4195,225710,ARRY,Array BioPharma Spikes On Announcement,opinion,"Array BioPharma Inc  NASDAQ ARRY 
Array BioPharma  a biopharmaceutical company yesterday announced that they are submitting for new drug application of their drug binimetinib  Binimetinib is used for patients suffering from NRAS  mutant melanoma  The submission is based on positive results from the pivotal phase 3 study which met its primary endpoint 
Array BioPharma Inc  CEO s Comments

The new drug application for binimetinib represents Array s first   an important milestone for this promising compound and our Company   said Ron Squarer  Chief Executive Officer  Array BioPharma   NRAS mutant melanoma represents an often overlooked subset of advanced disease without meaningful treatment options beyond immunotherapy and NEMO is the first ever trial to meet a PFS endpoint in this population  We look forward to working with the FDA as they evaluate our application and the potential for binimetinib as a treatment option for these patients 
Mr  Squarer added   While the results in the pre specified sub group of patients who had received prior treatment with immunotherapy are of interest  interpretation beyond overall consistency with the primary result should be made with care  Array anticipates that the primary consideration for marketing approval will be the results for the primary endpoint of the trial  PR Newswire

ARRY Technical Analysis

ARRY opened trading yesterday at  3 49  which was the same price as the previous days trading close  ARRY closed trading yesterday at  3 56 and spiked up after market to  3 75  equivalent to a 5  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time ARRY traded above these levels was on June 6 when it traded at  3 84  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that ARRY has been on an overall upward trend dating back to May 12 when it traded at  2 74  ARRY has a float of 95 84 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Thursday  For trading purposes  I would like to see ARRY open trading on Friday above  3 69 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 10 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

Westport Innovations  NASDAQ WPRT  broke out across resistance on Monday  opening at 4 78  running up to 5 25  before pulling back to 5 21  up 47 cents or 10   on 1 4 million shares  Look for a move that takes it to the 6 range  maybe even as high as 6 3 4 short term

ARRY Announces Positive Data With Regard To Binimetinib
Binimetinib is a clinical phase treatment that is designed to treat patients with advanced NRAS mutant melanoma  Early this morning ARRY announced data from the Phase 3 clinical trial of the treatment  known as NEMO  In the announcement  we learned that the study met its primary endpoint  Ultimately  the goal was to prove an improvement in progression free survival when compared to the current standard of care  dacarbazine  In the Binimetinib arm  progression free survival came in at 2 8 months  In the dacarbazine arm  progression free survival came in at 1 5 months  According to the data released  binimetinib was well tolerated  While there were adverse events  those events were consistent with previous results in NRAS melanoma patients 
Based on the findings of the NEMO trial  ARRY is now planning on submitting binimetinib to regulatory authorities in an attempt to achieve approval for marketing the drug as a positive treatment for NRAS mutant melanoma during the first half of 2016  The overall results of the trial  including progression free survival  objective response rate  safety and prespecified subgroup analyses will be released during a medical meeting in 2016  In a statement  Ron Squarer  CEO of ARRY had the following to say   

 We are excited to announce positive results from the NEMO trial  which suggest binimetinib has the potential to provide an important new treatment option for patients with advanced NRAS melanoma    We look forward to discussing the data with the FDA And other regulatory agencies in the near future  

How The Market Is Reacting To The News
We still have a couple of hours before the market opens  However  pre market activity on ARRY is overwhelmingly bullish  Currently  7 35   the stock is trading at  4 89 per share after a gain of 27 85  or  1 06 
What We Can Expect To See From ARRY Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish expectation with regard to what we can expect to see from ARRY moving forward  Based on the data that was released today  it seems as though binimetinib has proven to be a successful treatment for advanced NRAS melanoma  As a result of the positive data  ARRY has already announced that it will be seeking approval from the FDA in the first half of 2016  With that said  I m expecting for the submission of the NDA to prove to be a positive catalyst  followed by approval of the treatment  This of course  will lead to gains in the future ",2015-12-16,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/array-biopharma-(arry)-stock:-climbing-on-positive-data-376080,376080
4202,225717,ARRY,3 Biotech IPOs That Have Managed to Raise Funds,opinion,"The biotech space has been a rough environment in which to pull off an initial public offering this year  A host of companies have ditched their offerings last minute  with Bavarian Nordic  CO BAVA   the Novartis AG  NYSE NVS  backed GenSight and Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings LLC  NASDAQ VMET  just three examples among many  A few companies  however  have forged forward with their IPOs  and look to have done relatively well given current conditions  Here are three of the highest profile  and a look at what each is working on 
Intellia Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ NTLA 
Intellia announced the closing of its IPO on May 11  The company raised net proceeds of circa  113 million  and now lists on the NASDAQ  Intellia is a gene therapy biotech  with a specific focus on the development of treatments based on what s called CRISPR CAS9 technology  The technology  which one of the company s two founders developed  is a gene editing tool  Since the genome project completed back at the turn of the century  biotech companies have been trying to develop a gene editing tool that can harness a cell s natural repair mechanism to insert or remove elements of DNA  the process that underpins gene editing   Until CRISPR CAS9  this was not possible  Now  using the technology that Intellia owns  it is  The technology allows the company to undertake three specific types of editing   knockout  repair and insertion  The names here are pretty self explanatory   knockout is used to remove genes that create harmful proteins  repair is used to fix the same sorts of genes  insertion is used to add a functional gene to produce a protein that is lacking 
With these three edit types  the scope of potential target indications is huge  and therein lies Intellia s strategy  The company is conducting a broad development program that sees it target liver disease  certain oncological indications and HBV  The latter of these three  the hepatitis indication  is a partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ REGN   and is where the lion s share of the  113 million IPO capital will allocate 
Aeglea Bio Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ AGLE 
Aeglea closed out on its IPO mid April  having raised net proceeds of a little over  47 million  The company develops engineered human enzymes  which it then uses to target specific amino acids in a range of indications  Its lead candidate  AEB1102  just picked up fast track designation from the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  in the US  in an arginase deficiency indication  In patients with an arginase deficiency  arginine doesn t get broken down into urea  This causes a buildup of both the already mentioned arginine  and ammonia  in the body  This buildup leads to crippling muscle stiffness  and spasticity  and currently has no direct approved therapy  the currently available SOCs only target the symptoms  not the underlying condition  
Aeglea s AEB1102 aims to catalyze the otherwise underactive hydrolysis of  the breaking down of  arginine  and in doing so  inhibit the accumulation of excess ammonia and arginine in the patient 
It s still early days  The company is seeking to kick off human trials before the end of this year  funded with the IPO raised capital  The fast track designation should speed up any post trial reviews  but it wont speed up the trials themselves  so chances are it will be late 2018 early 2019 before the company gets anywhere near a pivotal in this indication  This doesn t mean there aren t any milestones to watch  of course  The nature of a fast track designation suggests we will get regular updates from any ongoing trial  in this instance  the upcoming phase I  as the company rolls out submissions to the FDA  Each of these updates have the potential to serve as upside catalysts  meaning Aeglea could be a rewarding allocation across the next 24 months if its data hints at efficacy 
PhaseRx Inc  NASDAQ PZRX 
Finally  PhaseRX  This company closed out its IPO on May 18  having raised  18 5 million via the sale of 3 7 million shares at  5 a share  The company initially sought a  7 price  but the tough environment alluded to in the introduction to this piece led to a discounted IPO  and slightly lower than targeted net proceeds as a result  This is not necessarily a bad thing  The company has to date funded its operations through capital infusions from the likes of Arch Venture Partners  a global biotech and healthcare fund that has supported now billion dollar biotech names including Agios Pharm  NASDAQ AGIO   Bluebird bio Inc  NASDAQ BLUE  and Array BioPharma Inc  NASDAQ ARRY   That it s IPO came in under target  therefore  looks more of a symptom of wider market sentiment  specifically  a risk off capital environment  than indicative of its potential  In turn  at its current open market price   a little over its  5 IPO price   investors can pick up what could be an undervalued exposure to the company s future growth  PhaseRX is targeting what are called urea cycle disorders  Coincidentally  this is a similar indication arena to that of the above mentioned Aeglea  The urea cycle is the cycle through which enzymes in the blood stream break down nitrogen  and remove ammonia from the body  In patients with urea cycle disorders  one or more of these enzymes is dysfunctional  or missing completely  and this leads to the inefficient removal of urea  Inefficiency in the removal of urea leads to a host of conditions  and the one that PhaseRX is targeting as a primary indication is called ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency  OTD   OTD is an inherited disorder that  as its name suggests  is caused by a lack of ornithine transcarbamylase  which is an enzyme  one of six  that breaks down nitrogen  This lack causes ammonia to build up in the blood  and leads to a host of symptoms ranging from the pretty mild  headache  nausea  to the severe  liver failure   With its lead candidate  ORX OTC  PhaseRX is hoping to deliver functional versions of the deficient enzyme through enzyme replacement therapy  ERT   ERT  at least  this specific type of ERT  uses a therapeutic mRNA which embeds itself in liver cells  which in turn go on to produce the enzyme in question 
Again  it s early in the development process  Of course  this is far from unusual in the biotech IPO space   most IPOs in the sector are targeted at raising capital to carry preclinical candidates into human trials  If PhaseRX  backed by the above mentioned Arch  can demonstrate early stage efficacy in its ERT pipeline  it could make for a rewarding allocation going forward ",2016-05-25,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-are-three-biotech-ipos-that-have-managed-to-raise-funds-despite-a-200132109,200132109
4203,225718,ARRY,4 Stocks To Watch  BUFF  FLXN  FN  GIMO,opinion,"It looks like the markets are consolidating  and with the long weekend coming up  it could be a dull day on Friday or a real wild day  More importantly  let s take a look at some of the individual chart patterns of stocks that are really starting to improve 
Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc  NASDAQ BUFF  has an interesting chart  up 18 cents to 25 94  on 446 545 shares traded  I put a swing back on it after I liked the way this stock has acted the last couple months  particularly with the pop above the double top that pulled back to form a wedge  If and when this does go  expect a test of the all time highs  post IPO highs  at about 28 80  which is the next target 
Flexion Theraptc  NASDAQ FLXN  had a good day on Thursday  up 5 78 to 17 23  or 50   on 2 3 million shares  It opened at 12 66  shot up to 17 35  backed off  and came on again  It traded beautifully  It s right up against resistance if it doesn t get a follow through  but if it does follow through  look for a test of about 20 1 2 21  It has 6 days to cover 
Fabrinet  NYSE FN  is really coming back strong  five days in a row  On Thursday  it was up another 1 31 to 35 22  or 3 86   on 600 255 shares traded  It looks like it s about to test the spike high around 36 1 2 3 4  and eventually 40 
Gigamon Inc  NYSE GIMO   which we put a swing on Thursday  was up 27 cents to 31 23  on 295 100 shares traded  I believe this stock is headed to substantially higher levels  It needs to make a move across 32 1 4  and it may happen very quickly  If it does  look for it to head up to 35  37  and then 40  It has 3 84 days to cover

4216,225731,ARRY,Biotech Stock Roundup  Cubist To Be Acquired By Merck  Bluebird Shoots,opinion,"It was a busy week for the biotech sector with several companies presenting data at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology  ASH   Meanwhile  yet another acquisition agreement was announced  Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ CBST  is set be acquired by Merck in the first quarter of 2015 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

1  Cubist s shares shot up 35 3  on news that the company will be acquired by pharma major  Merck  in a deal valued at about  9 5 billion  The agreement marks growing interest in companies focusing on anti infectives  Read more     Although Cubist received an unfavorable ruling in its Cubicin patent litigation against Hospira  Merck said that it remains committed to the acquisition  which is slated to go through in the first quarter of 2015 

2  Several companies like Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  ImmunoGen Inc  NASDAQ IMGN   Agios Pharm  NASDAQ AGIO   Read more    and Pharmacyclics Inc  NASDAQ PCYC  among others presented data at the annual meeting of ASH 

Another company that stood out at ASH is bluebird bio     shares shot up a whopping 72 39  on encouraging early stage data on LentiGlobin BB305 for the treatment of subjects with beta thalassemia major and severe sickle cell disease 

3  Amgen  gained earlier than expected FDA approval for its leukemia drug  Blincyto  Although the label comes with a boxed warning  approval came five months ahead of schedule   Amgen also successfully expanded the label of Xgeva  which can now be used for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy 

4 Incyte s  NASDAQ INCY  sole marketed product  Jakafi  gained approval for a rare and progressive blood cancer   polycythemia vera  PV    in the U S  This makes Jakafi the first and only FDA approved product for PV   The label expansion should boost Jakafi s sales significantly  Incyte had another set of good news with the company and its partner  Eli Lilly  reporting positive late stage results on their experimental rheumatoid arthritis treatment  baricitinib  Baricitinib is one of the most promising pipeline candidates for both Incyte and Lilly 

5  Array BioPharma Inc  NASDAQ ARRY  shares shot up 14 3  with the company set to regain rights to its late stage MEK inhibitor  binimetinib  from Novartis  Array stands to receive up to  85 million once the deal closes 

Performance

Over the last five trading days  Biogen Idec Inc  NASDAQ BIIB  was the highest gainer with shares increasing 5 89   A major part of this gain was due to encouraging Alzheimer s disease data presented by the company earlier  Alexion was the only major biotech to see a decline  down 0 50   in share price during this period 

Vertex  NASDAQ VRTX recorded the highest gain  61 24   among major biotechs over the last six months 
Overall  the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index was up 2 62  over the last five trading days  See the last biotech stock roundup here

4217,225732,ARRY,Array Biopharma And Pandora Deliver Big For Options Buyers,opinion,"I wish I could find a report that looks back on big stock moves and looks for any tell tale options activity  It is always difficult to translate options action into predictions on stocks  but having a  hindsight  report could prove educational  In the meantime  we will have to settle for sporadic reports like this piece  or let me know where I should look  
On Friday  January 23  Array BioPharma  Inc   NASDAQ ARRY  soared 41  on 36M shares traded  about 18x the average rolling 3 month volume  

Array Biopharma soars on Novartis  NYSE NVS  deal
The chart shows a very nice technical setup that could have been bought without knowing anything about ARRY s fundamental story  The gap up on December 4  2014 sent the stock soaring above its 200DMA and the subsequent dribble downward finally ended with a brief breakdown below 50DMA support  A buy on the 50DMA recovery would have made a lot of sense from a technical standpoint  especially given the earlier 200DMA breakout 
Here is a snippet of  that caused all the excitement 

 Array BioPharma Inc   NASDAQ  ARRY  today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to acquire worldwide rights to encorafenib  LGX818   a BRAF inhibitor currently in Phase 3 development  This agreement is conditional on the closing of transactions announced by Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline PLC  GSK  on April 22  2014  which are expected to close in the first half of 2015  and the agreement remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals  

Here is a snapshot of at least one trader who made a LOT of money off Friday s action  according to briefing com  on January 20  2015 ARRY Jun  5 calls traded 1 570 contracts versus open interest of 4 890 with almost all the volume attributable to one trade near the ask  The trades drove implied volatility from 83  to 94   According to data from Etrade com  those calls sold for around  0 95 each and are now worth about  2 70  a nifty 184  gain  Given volume of 2 093 contracts today  I can imagine this lucky trader cashed out 
In other options news  Pandora  NYSE P   soared 10  apparently in response to the results of a survey from    

 The 17 ad agencies included in the OTR Global survey said they are generally pleased with the performance of ads on Pandora  and plan on  significantly  boosting their ad spend on the streaming music service this year 
The OTR Global survey also said that Pandora local ad spend increased 90  year over year in the fourth quarter  


Pandora pops on favorable OTR Global survey results
The options trade that made big money on Pandora was VERY fortuitous  According to briefing com  M A rumors drove the purchase of about 10 000 call options versus under 1 000 put options  Briefing com specifically called out the Jan  16 weekly calls expiring FRDAY given volume of 4 440 options versus an open interest of 1 100  This action helped drive implied volatility from a mere 3  to 58   As the chart above shows  the low implied volatility made sense given Pandora came into the week trading around lows  levels last seen in mid 2013  
The VERY interesting trade here is a potential fade of Pandora ahead of earnings  It seems the trade was all about anticipating good results from the OTR Global survey and NOT earnings or M A action  The on going downtrend from the all time peak in March  2014 seems to support a negative bias toward earnings  I would of course NEVER short a stock like this  only options  for example     I will write more if I decide to make a trade ahead of earnings 
Be careful out there

Novogen  NASDAQ NVGN  has a bullish pattern  It s kind of up  it s down  it s very choppy  and It s not showing a pleasing pattern  That doesn t mean it can t continue upward  It was up 66 cents to 3 45  or 23 6  on Tuesday  and was up a little further in after hours  The one minute showed it getting as high as 3 50  and the daily charts has it closing at 3 45  so it was up a nickel since the market closed yesterday  That s significant because the major declining topsline may have been broken  If it does continue to move  it may see 4 00 4 25  and then 5 00 5 25  potentially 
Portola Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ PTLA  broke out on Friday and followed through nicely on Tuesday  up 2 06 to 37 02  or almost 6   on a little over a half million shares  Solid volume  but not terrific  A clean breakout to a major base could lead to  higher levels  Target is 40 
Rosetta  NASDAQ ROSG  had a great day  up 1 15 to 4 00  or 31 1 2   on 14 5 million shares on Tuesday  That was huge volume  It closed substantially off the high at 5 55  which is significant because it had its first snapback in that zone  There s resistance up at 5 50 5 55  The target is 6 50 6 70  See if it sets up a little flag there  It has three waves up  and it may get a fourth  and then a fifth wave up 
Silicon Motion Technology  NASDAQ SIMO  is one of my swing trades that is acting great  It recently broke out of the falling wedge and declining topsline  through lateral resistance  and prior highs from September  it pulled back and got very narrow for a couple days on lower volume  and on Tuesday  it popped 82 cents to 29 90  or 2 8 k on 721 800 shares traded  That s the best volume in four sessions  Let s see if it can get to the target at 30 50  If it can get through there  the targets are 33 at mid channel  followed by 36

4293,225808,ARRY,Bristol Myers Partners Array To Investigate Cancer Candidate,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   and Array BioPharma   NASDAQ ARRY   entered into a clinical research collaboration to investigate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Array s binimetinib in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb s Opdivo  nivolumab  and Opdivo   Yervoy  ipilimumab  regimen   The combination will be assessed to treat metastatic colorectal cancer in patients with microsatellite stable tumors 
Bristol Myers  shares have lost 7 7  year to date against the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 9 1  

Binimetinib is an investigational MEK inhibitor that is being studied in clinical trials in advanced cancer patients  including the phase III COLUMBUS trial in patients with BRAF mutant melanoma and the phase III BEACON CRC trial in patients with BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer 
The phase I II study is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2017  and the results from this study will be used to determine optimal approaches to advance the development of these combinations  The study will evaluate the preliminary anti tumor activity of combining binimetinib with Opdivo as well as binimetinib in combination with the Opdivo   Yervoy regimen  Per the agreement  Array and Bristol Myers Squibb will jointly support the study sponsored by the former 
However  we remind investors that in Mar 2017  Array withdrew its new drug application  NDA  for its binimetinib  from the FDA s Division of Oncology Products 2  The candidate was being evaluated as a monotherapy for the treatment of NRAS mutant melanoma  a rare  mutationally driven subset of skin cancer 
In fact  the decision to withdraw the NDA was based on thorough discussions with the FDA  following late cycle review meeting held with agency  According to the feedback received from the FDA  the clinical benefit demonstrated in the phase III NEMO study was not sufficient to support the NDA for that indication  Nonetheless  the action will not impact the other ongoing trial on the drug 
Recently  Bristol Myers also collaborated with Advaxis  Inc    NASDAQ ADXS   to evaluate ADXS DUAL  an investigational immunotherapy targeting HPV associated cancers  and the former s Opdivo  as a potential combination treatment option for women with metastatic cervical cancer  The study is expected to start by the end of 2017 and will assess this combination regimen in women with persistent  recurrent or metastatic  squamous or non squamous cell  carcinoma of the cervix who have failed at least one prior line of systemic chemotherapy Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price
    Zacks Rank   Stock to Consider
Both Bristol Myers and Array carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Another better ranked stock in the health care sector is VIVUS  Inc    NASDAQ VVUS   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see
