116836,338351,PSA,Investors eye bright spots in REIT sector,news,"By Sin ad Carew
 Reuters    While investors say they are wary of the broader real estate industry in a rising interest rate environment  some are still bullish on sectors such as self storage and manufactured homes 
Real Estate Investment Trusts  REITs  are typically seen as a defensive investment bet as their large dividend payouts offset slow but predictable growth 
The S P 500 real estate index has outperformed in the last six months with a 5 8 percent climb compared with the broader S P 500 s  SPX  0 4 percent advance 
REITs have been boosted recently on earnings strength and a slump in U S  Treasury 10 year yields  But some investors expect them to lose steam if bonds yields turn higher  assuming that the U S  Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates and the economy stays strong  Investors typically prefer bonds to defensive sectors like REITs when interest rates are rising 
The REIT sector however is down 0 2 percent for the year to date compared with the S P s 4 7 percent gain  It already lagged the S P 500 for the last two years with a 7 percent rise in 2017 compared with the S P s 19 4 percent advance and no change in 2016 compared with the S P s 9 5 percent increase 
But some REIT subsectors  which have already outperformed the real estate industry so far in 2018  may continue to climb 
The FTSE Nareit Equity Self Storage index  FTFN12  has risen 18 6 percent in the last six months and 10 6 percent year to date making it the biggest gainer in the sector  Self storage companies include Public Storage  N PSA    CubeSmart   N CUBE  and Life Storage Inc  N LSI  
Even with these gains  and an oversupply of capacity  self storage is still attractively valued  said Cedrik LaChance  Director of REIT Research at Green Street Advisors 
 In the last seven to eight years self storage companies have become very adept at marketing online   said Bob Zenouzi  a chief investment officer specializing in real estate at Macquarie Investment Management   People can t afford a home and need to downsize  You have stuff and need to store that stuff  
REITs that lease land to consumers who buy or rent manufactured residences such as mobile homes also stood out 
The FTSE Nareit Equity Manufactured Homes index has risen 16 3 percent in the last six months and 8 percent year to date  Companies in the sector include Equity Lifestyle Properties  N ELS  and Sun Communities  N SUI  
 We always love manufactured homes  It s ignored by too many investors so it remains attractively priced   said Green Street s LaChance who sees low capital spending costs as a key advantage   In real estate capex is really important and takes away a lot of the economics  
Macquarie s Zenouzi says that hefty price tags for traditional houses are making manufactured homes more attractive to cash strapped consumers 
 Demographics are a tailwind because retirees want to downsize  House prices are up  These are lower cost options  
Hotel REITs have also done well though some investors are getting wary  They have been helped by a boost in business travel due to U S  economic strength and recent U S  corporate tax cuts  And when demand is strong  hotel REITs are better placed to quickly raise rates for short term customers than REITs in long lease sectors such as office or healthcare REITS 
The FTSE Nareit Equity Lodging Resorts index  FTFN24  rising 4 8 percent in the last six months and 6 4 percent year to date  But those gains may have run their course 
 The share prices are effectively pricing in this rebound of corporate travel  Its priced in so aggressively we re starting to see hotels as an expensive sector   said LaChance 
Even if there are bargains in REITS  John Laforge  head of real estate asset strategy at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Investment Institute  in Florida warned against getting  over your skis  in the broader sector  Instead he favors fast growing sectors like industrials  healthcare or technology 
 We re late in the economic cycle  It s very classic for REITs to start underperforming   said Laforge who recently downgraded the sector to  neutral  from a  favorable  rating ",2018-07-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investors-eye-bright-spots-in-reit-sector-1529644,1529644

116922,338437,PSA,Public Storage  PSA  Lags Q3 FFO And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Public Storage  NYSE PSA  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  2 73 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 74 per share  This compares to FFO of  2 70 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  0 36   A quarter ago  it was expected that this self storage facility real estate investment trust would post FFO of  2 63 per share when it actually produced FFO of  2 64  delivering a surprise of 0 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times 
Public Storage  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  729 34 million for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 48   This compares to year ago revenues of  706 37 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Public Storage shares have added about 14 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Public Storage 
While Public Storage has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Public Storage was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

116946,338461,PSA,Public Storage  PSA  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Public Storage  NYSE PSA   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Public Storage currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PSA that show why this self storage facility real estate investment trust shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For PSA  shares are up 0 67  over the past week while the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry is up 0 24  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 19  compares favorably with the industry s 0 6  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Public Storage have risen 11 25   and are up 22 6  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 47  and 1 74   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PSA s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PSA is averaging 825 319 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with PSA 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PSA s consensus estimate  increasing from  10 70 to  10 75 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that PSA is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Public Storage on your short list ",2019-08-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/public-storage-psa-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200458620,200458620

116955,338470,PSA,What s In Store For Equity Residential s  EQR  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Equity Residential   NYSE EQR   is slated to report third quarter results on Oct 22  after market closes  The company s results are expected to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Chicago  IL based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  posted positive surprise of 1 18  in terms of FFO per share  Results displayed improved same store net operating income  NOI  and lease up NOI Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice  met in another and missed in the other occasion  recording an average positive surprise of 0 31   The graph below depicts this surprise history Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement Factors at PlayThe U S  apartment market has put up an impressive performance in the past few months  successfully banking on the stellar rental unit demand  While occupancy is hovering at a near record level  rents continue to register a steady rise Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  occupancy reached 96 3  as of third quarter 2019  with an impressive leasing activity  The figure is not only up from the prior year period s 95 9   but is also close to the all time high of 96 4  attained almost two decades ago in late 2000  The warmer months definitely witness an uptick in apartment leasing activity  However  this year  the performance was robust  as demand was particularly strong With an uptick in occupancy  rent growth also seems to be steady  For new leases  rents were up 1 2  during the third quarter  driving the annual rent growth pace to 3  and monthly rents averaging  1 416  This comes after a solid performance in the April June quarter Equity Residential too is expected to have benefited from its efforts to reposition the company s portfolio in high barrier to entry core markets  In the to be reported quarter  the company is likely to have witnessed healthy demand for its properties amid solid job market and household formation  The company is also likely to have gained from high home ownership costs in several markets which hinder transition from renter to homeowner However  Equity Residential has been experiencing high new supply across a number of its markets  This elevated supply level will likely keep putting pressure on new lease rates  occupancy as well as retention  and affect revenue growth in the upcoming period  Furthermore  concession activity remains high amid higher supply  which remains another concern This apart  as Equity Residential is repositioning its portfolio to focus on key markets  the company continues to acquire as well as dispose assets  At times  such transactions lead to dilutive impact in the near term  which cannot be bypassed   In fact  for the third quarter  Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share at 87 91 cents  Results are primarily anticipated to reflect positive impact of higher same store NOI  together with 2019 and 2018

116986,338501,PSA,Dividend Buy  5 REITs Ready For 114  Returns,opinion,"Last time we had a July like this  REITs  real estate investment trusts  ran wild  The top plays delivered dividends plus price gains between 40  and 114  
REIT Rhyme for 114  Returns 
Tell me if this sounds familiar 
It was July 
The stock market was hitting all time highs 
And the Fed was about to cut rates for the first time in a while 
We shall see if July 2019 continues to  rhyme  with July 1995  Back then  we had Fed Chair Alan Greenspan introduce the concept of the  Greenspan Put   the inside joke that the Maestro would save any decline in stocks with rate cuts 
This time around  we have Jay Powell s 180 degree  pivot  from hawk to dove  Whether he learned to listen to the markets  or the guy simply wants to keep his job  the President was pressing him to lower rates   he s going to be the first Fed chair since Greenspan to cut rates with stocks soaring 
Overall  this is bullish for REITs  which benefit from 
A strong overall economy  check    and
Easy money  check   
The mainstream financial media lazily harps on number two  and only rule two   that falling rates are good for REITs and rising rates are bad  This is true in a vacuum  but we invest in the real world 
While these firms do tend to benefit from cheap money being available  because they often use debt to fund acquisitions and growth   it is more important that the rent checks are coming in on time  These are the cash flows that are directly passed on to investors as dividends 
With a healthy enough economy today  this is a Goldilocks environment for many REITs  Business is good  because their tenants  businesses are good  and money is cheap and getting cheaper  Check and checkmate 
Thanks to their generous payouts  these REITs already tend to outperform their product peddling peers  Over the last decade  Vanguard s Real Estate ETF  VNQ  has outpaced the S P 500 at large 
Landlording s Been Better Than Business
Of course  it s easy enough to improve on VNQ  being the simple ETF it is  In fact  it s very possible to double your money with REITs in short order  The secret is focusing on the firms that are most likely to increase their dividends in the years ahead 
Which means their stock prices will follow  Dividend growth REIT stocks have wonderful  built in  capital appreciation potential because their share prices rise as their dividends climb 
Let s map out the case of a REIT dividend grower with some round numbers to make the math easy  We ll say the stock is a 5  payer growing its dividend by 5  per year  Its current yield  left column  stays constant amidst the dividend growth because its stock price  right column  rises along with its dividend 

We can identify the REITs most likely to increase their dividends simply by finding those with FFO  funds from operations  growth  FFO represents the amount of cash a REIT actually generates from its operations  It s where our dividend originates   which makes it the building block for everything else in the REIT world 
To calculate FFO  we start with net income  Then we add back depreciation and amortization  which are accounting expenses  and subtract profits from property sales  which are one time events  
FFO is the driver of dividend growth for REITs  Figure out where FFO is going  and you know where the payouts are heading   and how fast 
If FFO is stagnant  a firm can only increase its payout by increasing its payout ratio  And this isn t sustainable over time 
Rising FFO on a per share basis  on the other hand  will basically force management to raise its dividend  And that s what ultimately drives the stock price higher because dividend growth is all that matters for REITs  Figure out where the dividend is going  and you know where the stock price is heading 
Reason being  REIT yields are relatively consistent over time  For example  blue chip self storage name Public Storage  NYSE PSA  pays exactly what it did 10 years ago 
PSA s Payout  Same As It Ever Was
But be careful   just because the current yield goes nowhere doesn t mean the stock price goes nowhere  In fact  it s quite the opposite 
Over the last ten years  PSA has increased its dividend by an impressive 264   Its stock has followed suit  delivering 272  total returns to shareholders 
PSA s Dividend Drives its Stock Higher
Why d the stock peak back in 2016  Simple the dividend plateaued then  Without the promise of a higher payout  there was no catalyst to drive the stock price higher 
A list retailer Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   a mall REIT  has likewise been able to withstand much of the recent retail rout thanks to its rising dividend 
Simon Says  Higher Payout  Higher Prices
REITs can be excellent yield vehicles  But why not buy them for growth too  It is possible to have your dividend and enjoy price upside to boot   and it all starts with rising FFO 
PSA and SPG were good buys a decade ago  but their dividend growth has slowed  Fortunately  we have two REITs that we should focus on instead  Combined they yield up to 8 9  and they are likely to double their already generous dividends in the years ahead  Which means their stock prices should double  too

116987,338502,PSA,Public Storage  PSA  Surpasses Q2 FFO And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Public Storage  NYSE PSA  came out with quarterly funds from operations  FFO  of  2 64 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 63 per share  This compares to FFO of  2 65 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 0 38   A quarter ago  it was expected that this self storage facility real estate investment trust would post FFO of  2 52 per share when it actually produced FFO of  2 52  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
Public Storage  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  710 95 million for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 83   This compares to year ago revenues of  685 53 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Public Storage shares have added about 19 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Public Storage 
While Public Storage has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Public Storage was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  2 71 on  724 97 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  10 73 on  2 82 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  REIT and Equity Trust   Other is currently in the top 33  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/public-storage-psa-surpasses-q2-ffo-and-revenue-estimates-200447598,200447598

117023,338538,PSA,These 5 REITs Paying Up To 7 0  Will Soar As Rates Fall,opinion,"Real estate investment trusts  REITs  are simply the best dividend payers you can own right now  These tax loopholes literally  print money  when interest rates fall  So  with Fed Chair Jay Powell signaling that rate easing is on the way  we should load up on real estate dividends 
REITs themselves have flown under cover for years  but  basic  income investors have finally started to wake up to just how effective REITs are  In fact  these income friendly real estate plays are  quite literally  world beaters 
A Netherlands study examining global assets from 1960 to 2015 found that the top performing area of the market was not stocks  not bonds  not gold   but real estate investment companies and trusts 
By almost a full percentage point every year  no less 
More recently here in the US  the total return tape tells a similar tale 
This 10 Year Bull Market Belongs to Real Estate
And these outsized returns have largely been delivered in cash  Over the past 10 years  only 25  of the S P 500 s total returns have come from dividends  For REITs  that number is closer to 45  
High dividend yield plus still significant upside potential to grow your nest egg  I ve pounded the table about this formula s importance to retirees for years  and it s the driving force behind my Contrarian Income Report s 7   yields and 10 5  annualized total returns  including the fat dividends  
And now  as I mentioned earlier  the Fed is signaling that it s about to turn on the  buy signal  for REITs 
I ve explained to readers several times over the past few years that REITs eventually overcome growing interest rates because they typically signal a strong economy  and especially in this rate cycle  interest rates aren t coming anywhere close to challenging REIT yields 
But make no mistake  Flat or lower yields are superfoods for real estate investment trusts 
You can see how the Vanguard Real Estate ETF  NYSE VNQ  has responded since the Fed s signal that it would keep interest rates flat for the rest of 2019  And that little kick in June  You can thank renewed hopes for the potential for interest rate cuts later on this year 

It s not too late to enjoy the white hot run in REITs  which is outrunning most sectors in 2019 on price performance alone  Thanks to this wildly bullish environment  investors have the chance to squeeze 20  returns out of the next 12 months  And that s before collecting these fat dividends of 5 7   6 3  and even 7 0  
Spirit Realty  NYSE SRC Dividend Yield  5 7 
Spirit Realty  SRC  is a changed company  The  new Spirit  is a single tenant net lease REIT that deals in retail  distribution and service oriented companies  It leases out more than 1 500 properties in 49 states to 256 tenants such as Church s Chicken  Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA  and Life Time Fitness 
That sounds like a large  diversified portfolio   and it certainly is  But Spirit also is leaner than it was a year ago  Last June  the company finalized the spinoff of Spirit MTA REIT  NYSE SMTA   which took many of the company s noncore  lesser performing assets 
Things have generally looked up since then  Standard   Poor s upgraded the company s credit this year to BBB stable  Unencumbered assets  those free of any liens or other claims from financial institutions  jumped to 80   from 58  prior to the spinoff  And its operational results have been stellar  In Q1  same store sales grew 1 8   occupancy was 99 3   and Spirit upped its AFFO and capital deployment guidance for the full year 
Spirit Capital did decrease its dividend last year  too  but only to reflect the change of assets from the SMTA split  SRC had a history of payout increases prior to that  and considering that the current 62 5 cent dividend accounts for just 74  of this year s AFFO guidance  future hikes are a strong bet 
Mid America Apartment Communities  NYSE MAA Dividend Yield  3 3 
Mid America Apartment Communities  MAA  isn t the flashiest of apartment REITs  While companies such as UDR Inc   UDR  and Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS  are concentrated in high rent areas such as Los Angeles  San Francisco  Boston and New York  MAA is focused on the Southeast  Southwest and Mid Atlantic  That means cities such as Savannah  Georgia  Jackson Mississippi  the Phoenix Mesa Chandler metro area in Arizona  and the Dallas Fort Worth Arlington metro area in Texas 
But it s an opportunity I was excited about back in December 2016  soon after MAA jumped from 79 000 apartment units to 105 000 units by merging with Post Properties 
Since then 
Mid America  MAA  Has Nearly Lapped the Sector
A few years later  and MAA still looks appealing 
Mid America s footprint has grown a bit since then  to 101 954 apartment homes across 17 states and the District of Columbia  And it s still a prime performer  AFFO over the past four quarters has added up to  5 52 per share  up from the prior four quarters   5 32  That included a substantial 8  bump up in AFFO to  1 47 per share in Q1 of this year 
MAA s growth over the past few years has also allowed the REIT to flex its dividend muscles  expanding the payout by 31  in just five years  It still has stretching room  too  with its  3 84 per share in projected 2019 payouts well below the company s AFFO estimate of between  5 47 and  5 71 
I just have one complaint  The company s success has made it a little rich for my blood  Shares now trade at a frothy 21 times this year s expected AFFO  which leaves little room for error  Mid America should no doubt benefit from any Fed cuts  should they come  but ideally  it should be bought on weakness 
Independence Realty Trust  NYSE IRT Dividend Yield  6 3 
Independence Realty Trust  IRT  is another apartment REIT that s delivering prime returns from  secondary  housing markets 
The trust s 58 apartment properties contain 15 880 units across  non gateway  U S  markets in the Midwest  Mid Atlantic and Southeast  such as Atlanta  Indianapolis  Memphis  Raleigh and Columbus  Ohio  They don t sound like the most attractive housing markets  but IRT s markets are expected to grow 1 14  in 2019 almost double the rate of gateway markets and better than the 0 72  expected across the U S  Employment is growing faster  too 
The company currently is targeting 4 300 units for redevelopment across 14 of its properties  That investment of  50 million should result in a 15  20  ROI   unlocking an additional  8 0 to  9 0 million in annual  net interest income   once they re completed in 2020  IRT says 
Independence s most recent quarter was full of promise  Core funds from operations grew about 3  year over year  Same store NOI grew 5 1   Rental and other property revenue improved by 4   Total portfolio average occupancy sat around 93  
My only complaint here is with the dividend  The 6 3  yield is high  but so is the company s CFFO payout ratio  which sits around 95  of this year s estimates  IRT s dividend has been stuck at 72 cents per share for years  and it actually went from being a monthly payer to distributing quarterly as of 2018 
CubeSmart  NYSE CUBE Dividend Yield  3 8 
CubeSmart  CUBE  is an excellent player albeit  one that shares space with numerous other strong players  in what is an extremely fragmented industry 
The self storage industry is a very specific but massive  38 billion annual market in the U S   spanning some 1 7 billion square feet across the country  Nearly 1 in 10 Americans use self storage units  And self storage construction spending has gone from just less than  1 billion in 2014 to about  5 3 billion in 2017 

source  
The  Big Six  players  which include CubeSmart  Public Storage  NYSE PSA  and Extra Space Storage  NYSE EXR   account for just 18  of the market  Another 9  goes to the 100 next largest self storage companies  Just less than three quarters of the industry is made up of essentially mom  n  pop shops 
CubeSmart stands out by leaning on technology  whether it s the heavy use of data in its marketing  to maximizing the efficiency of its space through dynamic inventory management  to in place rate increases that maximize long term revenue 
This plan has driven CubeSmart to 80  five year growth in adjusted FFO  which the company has taken and funneled into a massive expansion of the dividend  165  over that same time 
CUBE recently upgraded its adjusted FFO forecast for 2019  raising it a penny per share on the low end to a range of  1 65  1 69  The only gripe here is that  like Mid American Apartment Communities  CubeSmart s valuation is plumping up  to about 20 times FFO those estimates 
Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  NYSE RQI Dividend Yield  6 9 
I m critical of indexed exchange traded funds because many of them indiscriminately lump together a bunch of similar assets to create a so so portfolio that de emphasizes some winners while giving more voice to losers 
I prefer active management when it comes to REITs  And who better to trust than Cohen   Steers  which the company itself boasts was founded in 1986 as  the first investment company to specialize in listed real estate  
Cohen   Steers Quality Income Realty Fund  RQI  delivers an above average fund yield of nearly 7  while offering you exposure not to one  but 130 companies spanning hundreds of thousands of apartment  self storage  data center  health care and other properties 
Its holdings include some true juggernauts of the real estate world  including  
American Tower  NYSE AMT   whose communications infrastructure powers technology from the likes of AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ 
Prologis  NYSE PLD   a premier warehousing and industrial REIT
Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS   which invests in apartment communities across the most well heeled cities on the West Coast 
Cohen   Steers  RQI  You Pay  But You Prosper
Does a closed end fund run by some of real estate s most talented managers cost more than a simple Vanguard index fund like the VNQ  Of course  But as RQI has proven over time  It s worth it

reported quarter  this self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered an in line performance in terms of FFO per share  Results highlighted higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot that supported the company s same store performance The company has a decent surprise history  In fact  it exceeded estimates in three of the preceding four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 0 75   This is depicted in the graph below Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States  The  Public Storage  brand is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry  with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the United States  With its robust scale and high brand value  the company is likely to have benefited from favorable fundamentals in the self storage industry Favorable demographic changes  improving job market and rising incomes  migration and downsizing trend  and declining home ownership and the resultant increase in the number of people renting homes are likely to have spurred demand for self storage spaces in the period under consideration Acquisition and expansion initiatives are also anticipated to stoke growth  Since the beginning of 2013 through Mar 31  2019  the company acquired 308 facilities with 21 4 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around  2 7 billion  Additionally  the company opened a newly developed and expanded self storage space for  1 4 billion  adding approximately 12 9 million net rentable square feet over this period Moreover  following Mar 31  2019  the company acquired or was under contract to acquire 10 self storage facilities  spanning 0 7 million net rentable square feet of space  for  116 4 million  Also  as of Mar 31  2019  the company had several facilities in development  1 2 million net rentable square feet   with an estimated cost of  194 million  as well as expansion projects  2 7 million net rentable square feet  worth roughly  318 million  Such efforts are likely to continue in the second quarter as well  boosting the company s performance Particularly  revenues are likely to grow in the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pinned at  705 1 million  depicting nearly 2 9  growth However  Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  In addition  in recent years  supply has been increasing in a number of markets  Particularly  deliveries are expected to remain elevated in the to be reported quarter  likely intensifying competition for the company  curbing its power to raise rents and turning on more discounting Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter FFO per share is pinned at  2 64  indicating a slip of 0 4  year over year  In addition  Public Storage s activities during the April June quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate

117049,338564,PSA,What To Expect From Extra Space Storage  EXR  Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Extra Space Storage   NYSE EXR   is slated to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  after market close  The company s quarterly results are expected to reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Salt Lake City  UT based self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 1 67  in terms of FFO per share  Results mirrored growth in same store net operating income  The company witnessed higher rental rates for both new and existing customers Over the trailing four quarters  Extra Space Storage exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two quarters and came in line in the other two  the average beat being 0 63   This is depicted in the graph below Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderThe self storage real estate industry is expected to have remained healthy in the quarter backed by demand from the downsizing trend  an encouraging labor market  declining home ownership and the resultant increase in the number of people renting homes Amid these key demand catalysts  Extra Space Storage seems well poised to have capitalized on the trends with a high quality portfolio of branded stores in high income regions of the United States in the quarter In fact  the company has been making concerted efforts to consistently grow its business and achieve geographical diversity through accretive acquisitions  mutually beneficial joint ventures and third party management services Particularly  over the past five years  Extra Space Storage acquired  4 6 billion in properties  Through these efforts  the company gained an increased scale in several core markets  and fortified its presence in a number of new markets  We anticipate these efforts to boost its first quarter performance Moreover  banking on brand value and operational expertise  the company continues to fortify its higher margin third party management business In fact  for the quarter  management and franchise fees are estimated to be around  11 5 million  indicating sequential growth of 5 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  266 million for property rental revenues implies an improvement from the prior year reported figure of  248 million These  in turn  will likely be conducive to 9  year over year revenue increase  with the top line pegged at  311 25 million for the quarter However  Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  In addition  there is a development boom of self storage units in many markets  In fact  this year  the impact of new supply is likely to be high because of the aggregate impact of several years of elevated development  This high supply is likely to fuel competition for the company  curb its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting Additionally  as the company leases space on a month to month basis  its leasing activity is expected to be under pressure in case the storage units are not re let promptly or if rates upon re letting fall substantially Amid these  Extra Space Storage s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at  1 14 in a month s time  However  it indicates improvement of 4 6  from the year ago reported figure Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Extra Space Storage is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1

117052,338567,PSA,Will Favorable Demographics Aid UDR Earnings This Season ,opinion,UDR Inc    NYSE UDR   is slated to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  after market close  The company s performance is expected to reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 2 04  in terms of FFO per share  The results reflected growth in revenues from operating and lease up communities In the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and matched the same on the other two  delivering an average surprise of 1 03  United Dominion Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    For first quarter 2019  UDR projects FFO as adjusted per share in the 48 50 cents range Let s see how things are shaping up  prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderUDR s high quality properties located in some affluent regions of the United States have ensured steady rental income generation over the past few years  The company s superior product mix of A B quality properties and strategic submarket locations will likely boost growth in combined new and renewal lease in the to be reported quarter  Further  this strategy of maintaining a diversified portfolio reduces the volatility of its same store growth Moreover  going by a recent  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage  Inc    the U S  apartment market managed to retain the rent momentum achieved in the latter part of 2018  although new supply volumes remained elevated in the January March quarter  Apartment rents were up 3 2  on an annual basis as of first quarter 2019  In fact  for six straight months  annual rent growth exceeded the 3  mark  In addition  occupancy came in at 95 2  in the quarter  expanding 10 basis points year on year Amid these  UDR is likely to benefit from favorable demographics  household formation  healthy economy and job market gains  which might accelerate demand for rental housing in its markets The company continues to focus on its strategic priorities such as disciplined capital allocation  strong balance sheet position as well as cash flows enhancement to support operational efficiency and dividend growth  These are likely to support its results in the quarter under review  Occupancy is likely to be higher  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is currently pegged at  267 1 million  indicating 5 4  year over year growth However  the company s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 50 cents over the last 30 days  Nevertheless  the figure indicates a 6 4  increase year over year In fact  new supply of apartment properties remained elevated in the first quarter in a number of the company s markets  Per the above mentioned study by RealPage  in the past six months  in the U S  market demand could not keep up with new product deliveries that aggregated 127 121 market rate units in fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019 Therefore  we remain apprehensive about UDR s performance as the company is likely to keep dealing with high deliveries in a number of its markets  This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply limits a landlord s ability to demand more rents  results in lesser absorption and leads to increased concession activity Here is what our quantitative model predicts UDR

117084,338599,PSA,What s In Store For Public Storage s  PSA  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Public Storage   NYSE PSA   is slated to release fourth quarter numbers on Feb 26  after market close  The company s funds from operations  FFO  per share  as well as revenues are anticipated to display year over year improvement in the quarter In the last reported quarter  this self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  reported better than expected performance in terms of FFO per share  delivering a positive surprise of 0 75   Results highlighted improvement in net operating income  NOI  from same store and non same store facilities The company has a decent surprise history  In fact  it exceeded estimates in each of the preceding four quarters  resulting in average positive surprise of 1 05   This is depicted in the graph below Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States  The  Public Storage  brand is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry  with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the United States The company is likely to benefit from favorable fundamentals in the self storage industry as favorable demographic changes  improving job market and rising incomes are likely to drive demand for self storage spaces In addition  acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth  In fact  since the beginning of 2013 through Sep 30  2018  the company acquired 287 facilities with 20 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around  2 6 billion  Further  the company opened newly developed and expanded self storage space for  1 2 billion  adding approximately 10 7 million net rentable square feet during this period Also  following Sep 30  2018  the company acquired or was under contract to acquire nine self storage facilities  spanning 0 6 million net rentable square feet of space  for  79 7 million  Apart from these  as of Sep 30  2018  the company had several facilities in development  1 6 million net rentable square feet   with an estimated cost of  251 million  as well as expansion projects  3 8 million net rentable square feet  worth roughly  346 million  Such efforts are likely to have continued in the fourth quarter  boosting the company s performance Public Storage is likely to have benefited from the steady demand in the self storage industry  as well as growth in revenues and NOI  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  692 7 million  depicting 3  growth However  in recent years  supply has been high in a number of markets and deliveries are estimated to have remained elevated in the fourth quarter as well  This is a concern as high supply affects the company s pricing power  In fact  the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting Furthermore  Public Storage s activities during the quarter did not gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share remained unrevised over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at  2 79  Nevertheless  the figure indicates nearly 1 5  rise  year over year Here is what our quantitative model predicts Public Storage does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  The Earnings ESP for Public Storage is  0 05

117086,338601,PSA,Global REIT ETF  REET  Hits New 52 Week High,opinion,"For investors seeking momentum  iShares Global REIT ETF    is probably on radar now  The fund just hit a 52 week high  which is up roughly 17 2  from its 52 week low price of  22 73 share 
But are more gains in store for this ETF  Let s take a quick look at the fund and the near term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed 
REET in Focus
The fund looks to track the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Global REIT Index  which is designed to track the performance of publicly listed real estate investment trusts in both developed and emerging markets  Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   4 38    Prologis  3 55   and Public Storage  NYSE PSA   2 56   are the top three holdings of the fund  United States  65   is the top geographical allocation of the fund followed by Japan  7 8   and Australia  5 8    It charges 14 bps in fees  see here  
Why the Move 
The real estate corner of the broad market has been an area to watch lately given the Fed s dovish stance that has kept the rates subdued and increased the lure for the rate sensitive stocks  Additionally  still unresolved U S  China trade war  global growth concerns and Brexit concerns are making global investors jittery  boosting the demand for safe haven assets  raising the appeal for these stocks  which in turn lowers yields  Dovish central banks in most of the developed markets have also been helping the operating backdrop of the real estate market 
More Gains Ahead 
The fund has   which hints at more gains  So  there is definitely still some promise for those who want to ride on this ETF a little longer

117091,338606,PSA,Key Factors To Impact Digital Realty s  DLR  Q1 Earnings,opinion,Digital Realty Trust   NYSE DLR   is scheduled to release first quarter 2019 results on Apr 25  after the market closes  The company s results will likely display year over year growth in funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues In the last reported quarter  this San Francisco  CA based data center real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 0 60  in terms of funds from operations  FFO  per share  Results were supported by growth in revenues Over the trailing four quarters  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions   the average beat being 1 56   This is depicted in the graph below Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderSolid fundamentals of the data center market are likely to have helped Digital Realty ride on its growth curve in the to be reported quarter  In fact  with growing popularity of cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  as well as the use of third party IT infrastructure by several companies  demand for data center spaces has been rising Also  the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five to eight years  resulting in an upbeat outlook for data centers in the future  As such  in the top tier data center markets  demand is outpacing supply and despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Amid these  Digital Realty is banking on strategic acquisitions and development efforts  which are expected to boost its top line growth  This January  the company announced the expansion of its Singapore connected campus with a new facility  Further  during the Dec end quarter  it completed the acquisition of Ascenty  a data center provider in Brazil  for roughly  1 8 billion  Moreover  the company has fortified its presence in Europe  Australia and Asia in recent years through strategic acquisitions and development of high quality facilities In addition to the above  Digital Realty has consistently strived for attaining operational excellence  In February  the company announced that it has achieved  five nines  of uptime  surpassing 99 999  availability throughout 2018  for the 12th consecutive year  It reflects the data center REIT s efficiency in developing and delivering data center solutions  This operational excellence has been achieved despite growth of the company s portfolio over the years  which has expanded from 74 data center suites at the beginning of 2007 to more than 800 by the end of 2018 Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter total revenues is nearly  795 5 million  indicating 6 9  year over year growth  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of  1 65 projects an increase of nearly 2 5  from the prior year reported figure However  competition has intensified  given the solid growth potential in the data center real estate market  This is likely to have resulted in aggressive pricing pressure in the quarter under review  In addition to this  interest expense burden remains a concern  with the company having a substantial debt position

117111,338626,PSA,The Five ETFs You Definitely Want In Your IRA,opinion,"Synopsis
If you re saving for retirement  you for sure will want to consider making an investment in ETF s  While mutual funds have long been the staple of long term investing  exchange traded funds have the advantage of offering lower expense ratios  This in turn makes them cheaper to own  even though they usually hold similar assets  In particular  the following 5 ETF s have good ratings and may achieve above average growth in the near future 
SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF  NYSE DIA 
Some of America s most well known and largest corporations can be found in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  These 30 companies have long histories of outperformance  and together have trillions of dollars in assets and market caps  As a result  they tend to be safer than other equity investments 
DIA  an ETF that passively follows the Dow index  is composed of these 30 stocks  Because the fund is passively managed  it does not try to beat the Dow  rather  it simply attempts to replicate its performance  The fund charges 17 basis points per year for its passive management  which is much lower than the 100  basis points a mutual fund typically charges 
Although most ETF s pay dividends every three months  DIA distributes its income once per month  If you re looking for an investment that will pay income more frequently than quarterly  DIA would be a wise choice  The monthly income stream could help to pay bills during retirement  The fund s annual yield is currently 2 06  
DIA has received excellent grades from Morningstar  a well known stock analyst  The fund has five stars out of five over 3 year  5 year  and 10 year periods  Morningstar considers DIA s risk profile to be below average  while its return potential is considered high 
Fidelity Core High Dividend ETF  NYSE FDVV 
Fidelity has a similar fund in FDVV  However  this ETF holds over 100 stocks  and some of these are mid cap firms  meaning that their market capitalizations are smaller than the 30 stocks in DIA  Because these businesses are smaller  they generally have greater upside potential  In order for a stock to be included in Fidelity s fund  it has to be expected to increase its payout in the future 
The types of companies in FDVV are mostly American firms  About 4  of the corporations are headquartered outside the US The fund has lots of REIT s  but only a few consumer defensive stocks  compared to similar funds 
FDVV is a rather new security  It was set up in 2017  so there s not much return history to speak of  It returned nearly 14  in that year  Because the ETF is so new  Morningstar has not yet rated it  Its expense ratio is a very low 29 basis points 
Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets  NYSE VEA 
It s always a good idea to bring some diversification to your portfolio in order to capture return potential in other markets  That s exactly what VEA tries to do  Launched by Vanguard in 2008  not the best year to start an investment   the fund has delivered nearly 7  annually over the past five years 
Over 95  of the fund s holdings are in non US equities  Countries that have a large presence in VEA include Germany and the United Kingdom  Companies include Royal Dutch Shell  Allianz  Nestle  and Samsung 
Vanguard is known to build funds with low expense ratios  and it certainly doesn t fail here  The fund charges just 0 07  per year  which is a tremendous bargain  VEA has over  70 billion in assets  which makes it a very large fund 
Vanguard s ETF distributes earnings every three months  Its current yield is about 2 8   Morningstar rates the fund s return potential higher than its risk  a good sign 
iShares Core US Aggregate Bond  NYSE AGG 
Stocks are generally more volatile than bonds  so if you re concerned about price fluctuations  or simply want a shorter term investment  you might want to consider purchasing fixed income assets  In particular  iShares  bond fund AGG has a very stable price history  Its worst year is only 1 98  in 2018  In one of the worst years in recent memory  2008  AGG actually went up 7 9  
The iShares fund holds cash and bonds  Most of these instruments are rated AAA  the highest possible bond rating  There are many US Treasury bonds in the portfolio  but there is also some agency debt  There is a smaller holding in corporate bonds  The typical coupon rate in the fund is 3 19  
Although Vanguard s fund was impressive at just 7 basis points  iShares has thrown down the gauntlet by charging just 0 05  per year  How it can afford to do that is anyone s guess  AGG does have over  54 billion in assets  It pays distributions monthly 
iShares US Real Estate  NYSE IYR 
Last  but definitely not least  in our survey is a REIT fund from iShares  IYR invests in real estate investment trusts  These are companies that hold physical properties and pay quarterly dividends  which are earned from rents and other forms of income 
All of the REIT s in IYR are US companies  They are mid cap and large cap firms  Some of the better known REITs in the fund include Vornado Realty Trust  NYSE VNO  and Public Storage  NYSE PSA   The fund s annualized 15 year return is over 9   a very good sign 
The average daily volume of IYR is 7 million  which is very high  This means that the bid ask spread will be low  which reduces the cost of trading  The fund s expense ratio is 44 basis points  and it pays dividends quarterly 
Recap

117116,338631,PSA,Why Is Public Storage  PSA  Up 2 4  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Public Storage  NYSE PSA   Shares have added about 2 4  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Public Storage due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Public Storage Q3 FFO Beats Estimates  Revenues Up Y YPublic Storage s third quarter 2018 core FFO per share of  2 70 improved 3 4  from the prior year quarter figure of  2 61  The reported figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 68 Results highlight improvement in NOI from same store and non same store facilities  Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company s same store performance  Additionally  Public Storage benefited from its expansion efforts in the reported quarter Quarterly revenues of  706 4 million also climbed 2 9  from the prior year quarter  The figure also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  704 5 million Behind the HeadlinesSame store revenues advanced 1 2  year over year to  574 5 million during the third quarter  while the company s NOI inched up 0 6  to  422 3 million  The upside in same store revenues was primarily driven by a 1 9  rise in realized annual rent per occupied square foot to  17 83  Nonetheless  the weighted average square foot occupancy of 94 0  contracted 60 basis points year over year In addition  the company s NOI from non same store facilities grew on the back of the 153 self storage facilities acquired and developed since January 2016 Portfolio ActivityDuring the Sep end quarter  Public Storage bought 11 self storage facilities  comprising 0 7 million net rentable square feet of area  for  73 8 million  Following Sep 30  2018  the company acquired or was under contract to acquire nine self storage facilities  spanning 0 6 million net rentable square feet of space  for  79 7 million Finally  as of Sep 30  2018  the company had several facilities in development  1 6 million net rentable square feet   with an estimated cost of  251 million  as well as expansion projects  3 8 million net rentable square feet  worth roughly  346 million  Public Storage estimates to incur the remaining  343 million of development costs related to these projects mainly over the next 18 months LiquidityPublic Storage exited third quarter 2018 with around  432 5 million of cash and cash equivalents  slightly down from  433 4 million recorded at the end of the previous year Shurgard Europe UpdateOn Oct 15  Shurgard Europe completed an initial public offering  Its shares started trading on Euronext Brussels under the  SHUR  symbol As a result of this offering  Public Storage s equity interest  consisting of a direct and indirect pro rata ownership interest in 31 3 million shares  shrunk from 49  to 36 6   35 2  assuming exercise of the  green shoe    Therefore  even with no share sell off  the company will record a gain on disposition in the current quarter  which will be as if the company had sold a proportionate share of its investment in Shurgard Europe Additionally  on Jul 13  2018  the company received a cash distribution of  145 4 million from Shurgard Europe

117138,338653,PSA,Dow Hits New High Despite Choppy Session ,opinion,"We were set for another spectacular day of all time highs on Wednesday and then the bottom dropped out  The major indices managed to come off their lows by the closing bell  but two of them still finished in the red  We had to settle for only one new record today 
	The Dow advanced 0 16   or about 41 points  to 26 252 1  That marks the latest closing high for the index  but at one point today it was up well over 100 points  The NASDAQ dropped 0 61  to 7415 1 and the S P was off 0 06  to 2837 5  It was a reversal of yesterday s session  which saw the NASDAQ and S P reach new highs while the Dow lost ground 
	There s certainly some nervousness as President Trump heads to Davos for a speech Friday  especially with all the talks recently about trade  tariffs and NAFTA  However  as Counterstrike mentions in the highlights section  the biggest cause for today s sluggishness may have just been  gravity   see more below  
	Also in the portfolios on Wednesday  Options Trader made a couple of bearish moves on stocks with weak Zacks Ranks and troubling chart patterns  Also  Home Run Investor picked up a new position from the highly ranked trucking industry Today s Portfolio Highlights Options Trader  As you probably already know  Kevin expects the market to double over the next four years  But such a bullish stance doesn t mean he can t use his options expertise to make a bearish bet every now and then  On Wednesday  the editor made these two moves 
	  Added 2 bear put spreads in Skyworks Solutions  SWKS   a key company in the Internet of Things  In addition to being a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   this stock also has a bearish flagging pattern on its chart that suggests a downside breakout to come  If SWKS closes at or below  92 50 by mid May  each option has profit potential of 138  
	  Added 3 bear put spreads in Public Storage  NYSE PSA   which is also a Zacks Rank  4 and has a Zacks VGM Score of  D   The stock has a bearish descending triangle pattern on its chart  suggesting more downside could be on the way  If PSA closes at or below  185 by mid June  then each of these options would see potential profit of 163  
	Read the full write up for specifics on both of these moves Home Run Investor  The trucking industry is in the top 6  of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 16th spot out of 265  Brian Bolan found a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  from this space that s moving in the right direction  Saia  SAIA  is a leading multi regional less than truckload carrier that was added to the portfolio on Wednesday  The company reports on February 2 and has a Zacks Style Score of  A  for growth  Earnings estimates for 2018 have climbed to  3 09 from  2 77 in the past 3 months  Read the complete commentary for a lot more on this new addition Counterstrike   Stocks sold off today on no headline  but rather because it was just time  Good ole profit taking after the market has ripped almost every day this year  While the S P did see a nice 30 handle sell off  damage was minimized with an afternoon rally 
	 It s about dang time we saw some selling  The S P has now set a record for amount of days without a sell off of over 5   If I had to give a reason for the selling today  I would refer you to Isaac Newton and his theory gravitation  What goes up must come down and that s what happened today 
	 Today s small move lower felt huge  as we just aren t used to the market going lower  Can u imagine what a 2  sell off would look like  It would feel like the world was ending  some of you might joke  the world would have to end for the market to fall 2      Jeremy Mullin Surprise Trader   It s almost comical investing in these markets  The funniest part to me is that when we actually have a down day in the market  it feels strange  It s almost as if it s not supposed to happen  And today can only loosely be characterized as a down day because it wasn t even all the major market averages in the red   Remember folks  this is earnings season and that means we are supposed to chop around a little bit  Take the selling as an opportunity to shop for stocks on sale   No reason for alarm here with the NASDAQ as the index took a small step back  Honestly  I d like to see the market give up a little more ground to help me gain exposure to some overheated industries  So far earnings season really is rocking and rolling and the next several quarters still look great      Dave Bartosiak  who also heads the Momentum Trader  Until Tomorrow Jim Giaquinto

117155,338670,PSA,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  NexPoint Residential Trust  Retail Opportunity Investments  CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust And Public Storage,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 22  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  REITs  Part 3  including NexPoint Residential Trust  Inc   NYSE   NYSE NXRT        Retail Opportunity Investments Corp   Nasdaq   NASDAQ ROIC        CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust  Inc   NYSE   NYSE CORR       and Public Storage  NYSE   NYSE PSA       Industry  REITs  Part 3Link  The use of leverage for real estate investment trust  REIT  businesses makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest rate movements  This is because a rise in the interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows  Therefore  asset valuation  including bond coupons and stock dividends  experiences a decline In addition to this  weakness in the fundamentals of certain asset categories has added to the woes because it further restricts the scope of enhancing the future cash flows from the properties of the corresponding REITs  Specifically  changes in consumer preferences and supply issues in a number of asset classes have affected the market fundamentals and are likely to continue thwarting growth of REITs in the coming months Therefore  prior to making any investment in this special hybrid class  one needs to pay close attention to all the weakness Fundamental WeaknessRetail REITParticularly  mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers  shopping preference through the online channel  resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon  These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times  In fact  the decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy s  NYSE M   J  C  Penney and Sears raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords Further  retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies  This is a pressing concern for retail REITs  as the trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions  which mall landlords are finding unjustified  Moreover  significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only hurt mall landlords  but also the tenants occupying space in that mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific types of retailers Amid these  retail REITs are fighting back and giving their malls a facelift in an attempt to lure customers  They are also adopting the latest technologies to offer attractive services to their tenants and mall visitors as well as transforming their traditional retail hubs into entertainment destinations  However  the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and  hence  is likely to limit growth in the profit margins of retail REITs in the near term Residential REITGrowth in supply in a number of property types is hurting fundamentals  Specifically  after achieving excellent growth over the past few years  residential REITs now have an excess of new apartment deliveries in several markets In fact  for the overall U S  apartment market  fourth quarter 2017 is projected to be the peak period for deliveries  However  delays resulting from labor shortage and escalating costs could push the peak season to first quarter 2018  as the expected completion dates of a number of projects are changing to early 2018 from late 2017 Per the  from Axiometrics  a RealPage Inc   RP  company  in 2018  the Washington  DC and Los Angeles markets are likely to witness an upswing in construction  while new units in New York and Seattle markets are expected to hover near the 2017 levels Elevated supply has already affected the performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters  The anticipation of a stressed environment in the near term is also likely to curb their ability to command more rents and affect concession levels  Further  with some of the residential REITs  development deliveries running behind schedule amid delays in construction activities  lease up net operating income is expected to be affected Self Storage REITIn the self storage industry  there is softness in demand  with customers remaining under stress due to the current economic environment  Additionally  supply has been rising in a number of markets and this is hurting the storage REITs  pricing power and revenue growth Healthcare REITSoftness in seniors housing fundamentals is also likely to continue in the upcoming quarters amid a rise in new supply in the market  This is anticipated to restrict healthcare REITs  pricing power and occupancy level Moreover  with healthcare providers opting for cost containment  less expensive delivery settings and new technologies  demand for medical office buildings as well as urgent care facilities is growing But amid the implementation healthcare reforms  the corresponding REITs have been distancing themselves from the skilled nursing facility  SNF  business  This is because though seniors housing  medical office buildings and hospitals have been able to realize solid revenue growth in recent years  SNFs are becoming more susceptible to top line pressure due to the gradual shift in the medical billing procedure In fact  tenants of SNFs derive the majority of their revenues in the form of payments from Medicare and other government insurance programs  However  these tenants have been facing shorter stays and lower rates amid the   which stresses more on the value of care provided rather than the volume of services offered On the other hand  though the U S  industrial real estate market is enjoying a considerable boost in demand because of the exponential growth of the e commerce business  supply has started to gain substantial momentum to put an end to the lengthiest stretch of demand supply imbalance in the market that started way back in 2010  In fact  a lot of new buildings are slated to be completed and made available this year and next  leading to higher supply and lesser scope for rent and occupancy growth Rising Rates Pose a ThreatFinally  rising rates will have an impact on the debt dependent REITs  Particularly  the pace and magnitude of rate hikes  and the capacity of REITs to absorb those increases are expected to substantially shape the industry s outlook  Therefore  things like lease durations and pricing power in the market would command much attention Specifically  with rates moving north  healthcare REITs are generally at risk because these usually have significant exposure to long term leased assets  which carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps  As a result  when the rate goes up  the cost of borrowing will increase  while their revenue flows will not get adjusted quickly for their fixed rate nature  leading to an adverse impact on profitability Moreover  performance of mortgage REITs  or mREITs  which offer real estate financing through the purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  are affected by the volatility in rates  These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on mortgage assets and their funding costs Apart from these  the dividend payout itself might turn out less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts in the event of a rate hike Bottom LineBefore calling the shots  investors should satisfy themselves by dispassionately absorbing both sides of the argument Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective REITs to AvoidSpecific REITs that we don t like are NexPoint Residential Trust  Inc   NYSE       Retail

117167,338682,PSA,Here s Why You Should Hold Public Storage  PSA  Stock Now,opinion,Public Storage   NYSE PSA   is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States  The  Public Storage  brand is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry  with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the nation  Further  the company has managed to create a significant presence in the European markets as well  through the Shurgard Storage Centers  acquisition in 2006 Moreover  the self storage industry s fundamentals are likely to be driven by favorable demographic changes  and events like marriages  shifting  death and even divorce  Also  due to shorter leasing periods  this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike In recent times  Public Storage announced opening of new units in Plano  TX  Specifically  the company unveiled nearly 900 storage units at a new self storage facility in the rapidly growing region of North Dallas In fact  the company has been efficiently capitalizing on growth opportunities  Since the beginning of 2015 through Sep 30  2017  the company has acquired a total of 86 facilities  with 6 2 million net rentable square feet from third parties for around  679 6 million  Further  since Jan 1  2013  Public Storage has opened newly developed and redeveloped self storage space for a total cost of  831 2 million  which added around 7 5 million of net rentable square feet Following the third quarter 2017 closure  the company acquired or was under contract to acquire eight self storage facilities  spanning 0 5 million net rentable square feet of space  for  67 8 million  Such acquisitions and expansions bode well for the company s long term growth  The company also has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector  with adequate liquidity to actively pursue acquisitions and developments Public Storage also delivered a decent performance in the recently reported quarter  The company s core funds from operations  FFO  per share of  2 61 marked 3 2  growth from the prior year quarter figure of  2 53  Results mirror an improvement in net operating income  NOI  from both same store and non same store facilities  Higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot supported the company s same store performance Shares of Public Storage have outperformed the  it belongs to in the past three months  The company s shares logged in a gain of 4 2  compared with growth of 3  recorded by the industry  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year FFO per share has been revised 0 1  upward in a month s time  reflecting analysts  bullish sentiments  Given its progress on fundamentals  the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead Nonetheless  supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company s pricing power  In fact  the company operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  This limits its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting Also  hike in interest rate is a concern for the company  Essentially  rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company  Moreover  the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust   NYSE CDR    Extra Space Storage   NYSE EXR   and Regency Centers Corporation   NYSE REG    All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   You can see  Cedar Realty s FFO per share estimates for 2017 remained unchanged at 54 cents in a month  Its share price has

117196,338711,PSA,Bet On These 6 REIT ETFs Amid Rate Hike Tantrums,opinion,"Even amid lingering rate issues and supply growth concerns in some asset categories  the real estate investment trust  REIT  industry managed to outpace the broader market in the first nine months of the year  This outperformance primarily suggests the growing appetite of investors for REIT stocks 

	In fact  for the year through Sep 30  the FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index managed to record a total  of 12 6  compared with the 7 8  increase logged by the S P 500 Index  On the other hand  the yield on the 10 year Treasury note declined 0 7  over this time frame 

	Further  a number of recent events are expected to significantly shape the REIT industry s outlook  The most notable among these was the  of Equity REITs  together with other real estate companies  to their own headline sector under the Global Industry Classification Standard  GICS   following the close of trading on Sep 16 

	This step is reflective of not only the growing importance of real estate in the global economy but is also likely to  into REITs as investment managers realign their portfolio strategies to bet more on this sector  So valuations are expected to get a push   Read   

	Second  the Federal Reserve decided to keep the rates unchanged in its September policy meeting  Obviously  the move relieved REIT investors for the time being because this debt dependent industry will continue to benefit from the low rate environment which keeps their borrowing costs down  On top of this  their dividend payout  which primarily makes them attractive  ends up being more lucrative than yields on fixed income and money market accounts in such an environment 

	However  the outcome of the two day meeting came with a grain of salt  The  revealed Fed s growing confidence in domestic economic growth  Yet  the central bank refrained from a rate hike call this time as it is waiting for  further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives   Now  since a hike is almost ruled out in the next Fed meeting which is slated in an uncertain period right before the presidential election  a liftoff in December seems to be pretty much on the table 

	Nevertheless  the  of economic projections this time revealed a pull down in expectations of rate increases in the years ahead  So  even when rates rise  the pace is likely to be modest  REITs are expected to have time to adjust their business accordingly   Read   

	In addition to the above issues  the performance of REITs is largely determined by the demand supply dynamics in individual asset categories  Therefore  as long as rate hikes are backed by an improving economy  REIT investors need not worry much  This is because when economic activity gathers steam  demand for space automatically grows 
Dividends Still Standing Tall
	Moreover  dividends are by far the biggest enticement to invest in REIT stocks  especially for income seeking investors  And encouragingly  as of Aug 31  the  of the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index was 3 87   which handily outpaced the 2 13  dividend yield offered by the S P 500 as of that date  Over long periods too  REITs have  the broader indexes with respect to dividend yields 

	Notably  the U S  law requires REITs to distribute 90  of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders  This unique feature made the industry stand out and gain a solid footing over the past 15 20 years   Read   
Capital Access
	Further  in recent years  REITs have been proactive in the capital market  They have drawn leverage from the low rate environment and improved their financials  In 2015  a total of  59 3 billion in public capital was raised by stock exchange listed REITs and in 2016 through Aug 31  REITs collected  52 3 billion in capital offerings 

	Moreover  reforms to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act  FIRPTA  are expected to offer easy access to capital from foreign investors for publicly traded REITs and commercial real estate

Volumes Are Dead
Last week was the slowest week of 2016 

Individual investor sentiment is also bored 
 bespokeinvest  Bullish sentiment has been below 40  for a record 41 straight weeks and 75 of last 76 

Even the fund flow data shows the lack of excitement in Equities  All the interest remains in Bonds 

Speaking of Bonds  Spanish 10 year yields  which were toxic four years ago  are now trading at less than 1  

And the value of negative yielding bonds moves to a record level carrying everything else with it 
The value of negative yielding bonds swelled to  13 4tn this week  as negative interest rates and central bank bond buying ripple through the debt market 
The universe of sub zero yielding debt   primarily government bonds in Europe and Japan but also a mounting number of highly rated corporate bonds   has grown from  13 1tn last week  according to figures compiled by Tradeweb for the Financial Times 
 It s surreal   said Gregory Peters  senior investment officer at Prudential  LON PRU  Fixed Income   It s clear that central banks are dominating markets  There s a race to the bottom  Central banks are the main drivers of this  it s not fundamental  
The New Zealand central bank became the latest to cut interest rates again  while the Bank of England recently restarted its quantitative easing programme to combat the economic slowdown that is expected to follow the UK s vote to leave the EU  About a quarter of the global economy now has negative interest rates 
That has further squashed bond yields  and forced investors to scurry into emerging markets  junk bonds and ultra long dated government debt to snap up what little remains of potential returns  Money is also spilling into the global stock market  helping the FTSE All World index to a 5 3 per cent gain this year and pushing all three main US equity indices to a  trifecta  of fresh records this week 
Plunging interest rates combined with economic worries has led to the below surge in Defensive sector fund flows 

The Leuthold Group illustrates other periods of Defensive stock overvaluation 
 Eight of ten S P sectors now trade above 20x trailing EPS  representing the broadest sector overvaluation since 2002  There were a few months during 1999 in which only the Utilities sector traded below a 20x multiple  In 2016  of course  that sector s combination of low volatility and yield earns it a P E of 22x in line with the S P 500 median  The positive side of this revolting development is that Growth managers can finally buy Utilities  

Barron s also noted the extreme level of Defensive stocks making up the market s Momentum index 
The S P 500 traded at a new high last Thursday  continuing a streak of records that began when it finally broke its May 2015 peak on July 11  Since that old high  however  the market s outperformers have been its safest stocks utilities  telecommunication companies  and consumer staples  That s particularly apparent when looking at the top gainers over the past 12 months  More than 30  of the 100 best performing equities in the Russell 1000 a group known as  high momentum  stocks come from defensive sectors  That level has been breached just five times since 1990 
Momentum and safety  however  are strange bedfellows and their pairing doesn t tend to last  While that could be bad news for investors in utilities  staples  and telecoms  it has historically been great news for the stock market 
If this is a bad sign  then I want to BUY it 

Just looking at the two charts below  one can see the Defensives getting tired while the Cyclicals look much more interesting to buy 

And so lots of yawns in the last month over the  1 6  move in the S P 500 as the VIX falls below 12 
But look under the surface  Some really good returns have been made in Technology  Biotech  Small Cap  Emerging Int l and Developed Int l equities 

As department store retail declines  even Macy s has now become a real estate play 
Macy s  NYSE M  is closing 100 stores as the company tries to right its ship in a world where department stores continue to see weak mall traffic and face rising competition from online retailers 
Macy s  which has a current portfolio of 728 stores  said it expects most of the stores will close in early 2017 and said it will disclose the locations at a later date  The move comes as the value of the real estate exceeds its value as a retail store 
The Ohio based company had previously come under pressure from activist investors to unlock value from its vast property holdings  The department store  which also owns Bloomingdales  has also been exploring a  partnership or joint venture transactions involving the company s flagship and mall based properties  
One of the hottest areas of the REIT sector has been self storage  but even too much capital can have a dampening effect on returns  Public Storage  NYSE PSA  is the giant with 2 000  properties and they believe the industry is adding supply at a 20  rate 
Occupancy growth stalled with top markets full  Although Internet searches were up  customer conversions slowed  As a result  some REITs increased promotions and cut rates  There s also a burgeoning concern of some rate growth fatigue from existing customers in select markets with strong rate growth over the past couple of years  At the same time  expense growth is picking up  driven by higher property taxes  Supply continues to grow and is up roughly  20  over the last 12 months according to PSA  The weakest markets included Houston  Austin  Denver   Chicago 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
An interesting portfolio from one of the industry hedge fund legends 
Pretty certain that I would have to rename my fund  Smaug  if I was running an 86  gold position 

For portfolio managers of all styles  the lack of returns is hitting pocketbooks across the board 
Outflows and fee pressure have cast a dark shadow over earnings season in the asset management business and that gloomy outlook is expected to hit bonuses for firms of all stripes  according to forecasts from compensation consultant Johnson Associates 
Traditional asset managers should see their incentive based compensation fall between 5  to 10  from 2015 levels while hedge fund staff bonuses are expected to dwindle by 5  to 15   according to Johnson Associates 
Those disappointing numbers are a continuation of a trend that started last year in the traditional space and in 2013 for hedge funds  What s new is the forecast of a reversal for private equity managers  where bonuses have steadily risen since 2011  But this year  Johnson Associates is forecasting a 5  decrease in incentive based pay at PE firms 

The decline in Asset Manager compensation could explain why Aspen s real estate market has hit a bump in the trail 
The summer crowds are dense in Aspen  Sales tax revenues are soaring  Lodging occupancy is high  So why is Aspen s high end real estate market   one of the most robust in the country  with dozens of options for buyers ready to spend more than  10 million   in its first ever sustained nosedive 
High end sales that fuel Aspen s  2 billion a year real estate market are evaporating  pushing Pitkin County s sales volume down more than 42 percent to  546 45 million for the first half of the year from  939 91 million in the same period of 2015

117219,338734,PSA,Top ETF Stories Of August,opinion,"The month of August was lukewarm for U S  equities  Pushing aside the highly exaggerated  probably  Brexit blues at June end  the global market seemed to have returned to its normal course  The S P 500 based   AX SPY   added 0 2   Dow Jones Industrial Average based   V DIA   ticked up 0 04  and Nasdaq 100 based  tacked on over 0 5  gains 
The all world ETF iShares MSCI ACWI  added about 0 7   Europe ETF Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF  notched 1 8  gains while the emerging market ETF iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  added 1 1  in the month 
Let s delve a little deeper into the events mainly caused such market movements and are worth watching in the next month 
Renewed Fed Hike Bets
Investors were busy discussing the timeline of the Fed rate hike throughout the month  Fed chief Janet Yellen indicated that the U S  economy is moving slowly toward the   which in turn bolstered chances of a Fed rate hike in the coming days  Yellen also noted that  while economic growth has not been rapid  it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the labor market  
Investors should note that several Fed officials have been advocating a September or a sooner than expected rate hike over the last few days  With this  PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF  NYSE UUP  gained momentum at the end of the month and finished August with 0 3  returns  read  
Finance   Tech Stocks Win
As soon as rate hike hearsay took center stage  financial stocks started flying  This segment performs better in a rising rate environment  Also  better than second quarter results from some of the sector biggies played an important role in boosting the sector in recent times  Bank ETFs including SPDR S P Bank ETF  and SPDR S P Regional Banking ETF   CO KRE   added about over 8  in the month  read    
Another soaring sector in the month was technology  a beneficiary of better than expected earnings and return of risk on sentiments to the market  SPDR S P Technology Hardware ETF  and Social Media Index ETF   CM SOCL   added about 11 1  and 7 5  in the market  respectively 
Oil  Bear to Bull in a Month
The most amazing thing happened with the commodity oil  which saw both bear and bull markets in August  In early August  oil reeled at the  40 level and slid to the bear territory due to the supply glut  However  within a few days  oil sprung to a bull market  having witnessed a 20  rise from the latest low  Hopes of output freeze talks in an informal meeting among Saudi Arabia  Russia and the other major producers in Algeria this month actually fueled the price of oil  United States Oil  NYSE USO  added about 6 2  and United States Brent Oil  BNO  advanced about 7 5  in the month  read   
Miners Peter Out
It s common knowledge that the prospect of a rising greenback is not good news of commodity investing as commodities are linked to the U S  dollar  So  most of the precious metals including gold and silver slump in the month  Thanks to this trend  mining ETFs also did not fare well 
Apart from the greenback issue  profit booking activity might have played a role in the sell off of mining ETFs  Mining ETFs witnessed an astounding rally this year  with VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX    PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals Portfolio ETF   NYSE PSA   and PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF  adding about 117 4   85 4  and 211 3   respectively  as of August 31  2016  
After scaling this height  a sell off seems natural in a security  especially when the underlying operating backdrop for the fund is unfavorable  GDXJ  PSAU and SILJ were down in the range of 15  to 17  in August 
Small Caps in Favor
With U S  job  retail and manufacturing data coming in decent to upbeat lately  many became sure of the underlying strength in the economy  Meanwhile  U S  consumer confidence grew to an  in August while consumer spending in the second quarter jumped 4 4  from the year ago level  rising at a fastest rate since the last quarter of 2014  read    
All the optimism ruled out the slight tick down in the  second estimate  of Q2 GDP  And small cap stocks beat larger ones as they better reflect the uptick in an economy  PowerShares FTSE RAFI US 1500 Small Mid Portfolio ETF  added about 4 6  in August while Guggenheim S P 500 Equal Weight ETF  gained about 1

This product offers exposure to the real estate investment trusts  REITs  that purchase office buildings  hotels  and other real property  It has a multi cap focus with about one fourth exposure in retail REITs  It charges investors 12 basis points a year in fees and has top holdings in Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG  and Public Storage  NYSE PSA   see    Why the Move 
The real estate corner of the broad investing world has been an area to watch lately given the resurfacing of global slowdown concerns following downbeat Chinese manufacturing data and lowered growth expectation in Europe  Additionally  continued dovish comments from the Fed and the negative interest rate policy in countries like Europe and Japan have pushed the Treasury yields lower  raising the appeal for the high yielding securities like REITs  Further  the upcoming split of real estate securities from the financial service sector into a separate sector under the Global Industry Classification Standard on August 31 has turned investors  attention to it along with new capital inflows More Gains Ahead 
Currently  VNQ has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or  Buy  rating with a Medium risk outlook  suggesting continued outperformance in the months ahead  Further  many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank  so there is definitely still some promise for those who want to ride on this surging ETF a little further ",2016-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reit-etf-(vnq)-hits-new-52-week-high-200128245,200128245

117266,338781,PSA,Fed s Securities Purchases Blunt The Impact Of Convexity Hedging ,opinion,Mortgage backed securities  MBS  have sold off sharply over the past month as fixed income markets face the new reality of rising rates But unlike most other fixed income securities  MBS duration tends to increase with yield  That s because higher MBS yields typically mean higher mortgage rates and lower mortgage refinancing activity  which we have already seen   Pools of mortgages backing many MBS  particularly loans with lower coupon  will experience slower prepayment speeds going forward  Slower refinancing extends the effective duration of the bonds  illustration below  If you have a 30 year mortgage at 3 6   it is now less likely you will refinance any time soon  mortgage rates today are above 4    One reason your mortgage is not treated as a full term 30 year note is the probability that you will sell your house  thus terminating the note  There is also some probability that in the future  mortgage rates will drop below 3 6  again  providing you another opportunity to refinance  The expected average life of your 3 6  mortgage and the security that is backed by your loan has therefore been extended  from you potentially refinancing in the next six months to you selling your house in say 5 years   And if rates rise further  prepayments will slow even more  The chart below shows the prepayment speed  PSA  for just such a security over the past month as well as the expected prepayment speeds going forward  It also shows what happens if rates increase by another half a percent What does this mean for investors who hold MBS or actual pools of mortgage loans  They own securities that become riskier  more sensitive to rates  as rates rise  These portfolios have what s often called a  negative convexity  risk profile  To combat rising durations of their portfolios and therefore higher exposure to rates  many investors now have to short longer dated treasuries or rate swaps  And until recently many MBS investors haven t been doing much hedging because the hedge  the treasury short positions  has consistently lost them money  Now many are jumping in   all at the same time   to put the hedges on  And that hedging is putting downward pressure on treasuries  upward pressure on yields       As rates increase  the expected average lives of mortgage bonds and loan servicing contracts extend as potential refinancing drops  leaving holders more vulnerable to losses from rising rates  Investors then may seek to pare the duration risk or rebalance existing hedges by selling longer dated Treasury securities  mortgage bonds or transacting in interest rate swaps or options on those contracts  sending yields even higher and spreads wider   One measure of duration of agency mortgage bonds rose to 4 8 years last week from 3 7 years in April  Barclays index data show  The duration of Fannie Mae  FNMA  s 3 5 percent debt  which is now 6 2 years  would rise to 7 8 years if rates rise 1 percentage point  according to Bloomberg s prepayment model  This mortgage driven rise in rates happened before   in 1994 and again in 2003  The act of shorting  selling  treasuries increased yields  raising MBS durations and forcing more treasury selling  Some have referred to this market dynamic as the  convexity hedging spiral   Of course this is not 1994  or 2003 for that matter   At least for the time being  the Fed is still buying massive amounts of both MBS and treasuries  And all that buying limits the impact of convexity hedging  Treasury sellers that want to hedge portfolios always find one large buyer with  deep pockets   Furthermore  all the MBS held by the Fed is not getting hedged  With no requirement to mark the book to markets  the Fed is fine taking losses on that portfolio       The actual convexity hedging flows will be less when rates rise this time than it was in the past   Dominic Konstam  the global head of interest rates research at Deutsche Bank     The hedging  was massive in 2003  and we won t see a repeat of that  With the Fed holding so much of the mortgage paper  it really knocks down the amount of mortgage hedging needed when yields rise   What will happen once the Fed ends its program however is anyone s guess ,2013-06-14,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fed's-securities-purchases-blunt-the-impact-of-convexity-hedging-171296,171296
117270,338785,PSA,5 Indispensable Retirement REITs,opinion,"An ideal retirement investment should have three characteristics  It should offer a decent dividend yield  The dividend should be safe and reliable  And to protect against the ravages of inflation in your retirement years  the income stream should rise over time 
Surprisingly  most  income  investments fail at least one of these criteria  Bonds offer a safe yield  but in this rate environment it is not a particularly attractive one  And the payout certainly doesn t rise over time  Mortgage REITs  Real Estate Investment Trusts  often pay out very attractive dividend yields  but the payout is rarely consistent  and mortgage REITs routinely cut their dividends when the yield curve flattens 
What about dividend paying stocks  There are plenty of dividend paying stocks that meet our criteria   and  Core Dividend Portfolio is chock full of them   but as a general rule  the higher and more enticing the dividend yield  the highly the likelihood that the dividend will be cut 
For the best combination of high dividend yield  safety  and inflation beating dividend growth  your best bet is the equity REIT sector  And today  I m going to give you five of my favorite retirement REITs 
1  Realty Income  O 
Dividend yield  5 2 
I ll start with a REIT that is so perfectly tailor made for a retirement portfolio  I consider it irresponsible not to own it  Realty Income  NYSE O   Realty income is a  triple net  retail REIT  meaning that its tenants are responsible for paying all taxes  insurance and maintenance  Realty Income only responsibility is to collect the rent   and to acquire new properties  of course 
Realty Income is known as the Monthly Dividend Company  and for good reason  It has paid 524 uninterrupted monthly dividends and has raised its dividend 75 times since 1994 
There is nothing to dislike about Realty Income as a retirement REIT  At current prices  it yields an attractive 5 2   And its track record has proven it to be a reliable payer with a long history of keeping pace with inflation  The fact that the REIT pays its dividend monthly rather than quarterly is a nice bonus as well  as most of our living expenses in retirement will come on a monthly schedule 
2  National Retail Properties  NNN 
Dividend yield  4 7 
Next on the list of retirement REITs is a close competitor of Realty Income  National Retail Properties  NYSE NNN   Like Realty Income  National Retail is a triple net retail REIT  hence its ticker symbol   NNN  represents  triple net  
Also like Realty Income  NNN has been a serial dividend raiser over the years  The REIT has raised its dividend for 24 consecutive years and counting  NNN sports a current dividend yield of 4 7   and its payout is plenty safe 
National Retail Properties and Realty Income invest in the same basic types of properties  Your local Walgreen  NYSE WAG  pharmacy is a perfect example  a free standing building in a high traffic area rented under a long term lease by a high quality tenant  These are properties that you can safely bet your retirement on 
3  Public Storage  PSA 
Dividend yield  3 3 
No list of quality retirement REITs would be complete without Public Storage  NYSE PSA   the world s largest landlord of self storage units  Since building its first self storage facility in 1972  Public Storage has grown into an empire of more than 2 200 locations in the United States and Europe  totaling more than 142 million net rentable square feet  And its PS Business Parks interest adds another 28 million rentable square feet of commercial and industrial space 
Storage lockers have been a big business in recent years  and the housing bust was certainly a contributor  Americans who lost their homes or were forced to downsize had to put their belongings somewhere  But even as the housing market recovers  demand should remain high for storage lockers due to demographic factors 
Baby Boomers are starting the process of downsizing  selling their large suburban homes now that their children have left the nest  As they settle in to smaller digs  they will need to find a place to store their belongings  Public Storage will be the first number they call 
Public Storage pays a safe and respectable yield of 3 3   It has also been a monster dividend raiser  Public Storage has raised its quarterly dividend from 22 cents per share in 2000 to  1 40 today  And the rate of increases is accelerating  the REIT has more than doubled its dividend since 2010 
4  Healthcare Trust of America  HTA 
Dividend yield  5 
Another retirement REIT benefitting from favorable demographic trends is Healthcare Trust of America  HTA   one of the largest medical office landlords in America 
As Americans age  they will require more healthcare services  That part is a no brainer  The problem  though  is getting paid  With the U S  government strapped for cash  Medicare reimbursements are a lot less generous than they used to be across most of the medical field  And in the age of Obamacare s micromanagement  many doctors may see significant cuts to their income 
But while the economics of medicine may not be as attractive as they once were  doctors are still reliable rent payers  This makes HTA a safe bet  And with a current dividend yield of 5   HTA is an attractive one as well  HTA is a young REIT  having only gone public in 2012  So it s too early to sing its praises as a dividend raiser  But given the favorable economics of the business  I would expect the dividend hikes to follow shortly 
5  Retail Opportunity Investments  ROIC 
Dividend yield  4 1 
The last retirement REIT on the list is another young REIT  Retail Opportunity Investments  ROIC O   ROIC has a simple enough business model  The company buys neighborhood shopping centers  generally anchored by a  necessity based  retailer such as a major grocery store  The REIT currently owns and operates fifty one shopping centers encompassing approximately 5 5 million square feet 
There is a lot to be said for buying small  relatively new REITs  Unlike some of their larger peers  which overextended themselves during the bubble years of the mid 2000s  younger REITs have a fresh balance sheet  They have no  legacy  properties that are carried at unrealistic values  and they have comparatively low levels of debt 
ROIC has raised its dividend 8 times since going public in 2010  and it sports an attractive 4 1  dividend yield  Given the conservative nature of its real estate portfolio  I would consider ROIC a solid contender for a retirement REIT portfolio

117273,338788,PSA,2015 Reallocation Strategy  No  Driverless  Investing Here,opinion,"The Good And Bad News About Those  Driverless Investment Vehicles 
New technologies always excite the animal spirits  Take commercial drones  for instance  At first blush  these pilotless aircraft offer nothing but excitement and good news  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  would be shipping goods to our doorstep via drones  people could watch sporting events up close and personal without having to buy a ticket  you could borrow a cup of sugar from your mom who lives a few miles away  and there would be fewer trucks and vans on our roadways 
Sounds pretty good  doesn t it  Well  put away your Jetsons fantasy for a moment  anyway  It could all happen but  along the way  we need to face the reality that any idiot can buy a drone and do any damn fool thing they want  That includes  for instance  voyeurs who want to peep into your private lives  Do you need to keep the curtains closed instead of enjoying a beautiful day or night 
Then there are the driverless cars being touted as the way to relieve urban traffic congestion  They let you read  watch TV or play video games on your daily commute  reduce accidents  and clean up the environment  Let s talk about vehicle safety  Have you seen the video where a Jeep driven by a human journalist has the systems overridden by faraway hackers and driven into a ditch   Gently driven into a ditch  this was  after all  a controlled experiment  
Now imagine if a terror group or sovereign state like  say  Iran  Russia or China  with vast cyber hacking armies under their command  decided to reverse the accident avoidance systems of cars in the 25 largest American cities just before rush hour  sending vehicles with no allowance for human override careening into each other at high speeds 
I love new technologies  But it bears pointing out that there are many sides to every innovation   and that human intervention should be part of any fail safe robotic system  Like these two new technologies  a certain style of investment management and portfolio allocation has risen its head yet again   as it always does after a 5 or 6 year bull market  The benefit if you can even call it that of these approaches is that they don t require any decision making 
These are automated investment plans that take one of two typical variations 
 1  the Bogle School  whose mantra is 

 Wall Street is a Random Walk so don t try to beat the market  Just buy and hold a diversified ETF or mutual fund that mirrors a broad based benchmark like the S P 500  Never sell until you need to take some funds out for retirement  college or some other important life event  

 2   Use a robot   This will be either some quant black box approach that determines when to buy and sell or  better still  rebalances a diversified portfolio tied to many different benchmarks like emerging markets  small cap US  large cap international  etc  The rebalancing forces you to buy low and sell high  When one part of the portfolio performs better than the others and another performs worse  the percent of each held will deviate from your chosen parameters  and you ll rebalance  This approach assumes a steady reversion to the mean so you are  theoretically  selling a part of your winners and adding to your losers  which will revert to the mean and become winners 
Our firm starts with something like  2 here but we then add enhancing strategies to tell us what and when to sell and what and when to buy  But for now let s forget about adding the human element we use  and just take a look at these two currently  driverless investment vehicles  
Buy and hold is great  Until it isn t  There are two problems with buy and hold  As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow  the market will at some point enter a bear market  If there were no bear markets  there d be no risk and hence no reward  One of two things will happen to buy and hold investors during a bear market  either they will hold on or they won t  Neither are attractive alternatives 
In 2008  the S P 500 lost 38 5  of its value   100 000 became  61 500  If Mr  Buy and Hold held on  he was rewarded when  in 2009  the market rebounded 23 5    From March 9 forward  that is  he was down even further in Jan Feb 2009   Not too bad  right  Ummm  Not so fast  A 23 5  rise on  63 500 is not the same as a 23 5  rise on  100 000  That rebound in 2009 only took his portfolio back to  75 953  In 2010 a 12 8  rise in the S P  however  got him back to  85 675  Regrettably  2011 was exactly flat on the S P so he spent another year underwater at  85 675 
2012 was a good year and his portfolio increased to  97 156  Then  finally  in early 2013  he broke even  So if Mr  Buy and Hold held on for 4 years  dividends would have reduced this holding period somewhat  he d have suffered confidence  despair  hope  relief and  today  with the unusually strong bull of the last two years  perhaps a misplaced hubris 
The alternative would have likely been worse  If Mr  Buy and Hold threw in the towel somewhere along the way  maybe in January 2009  he d have lost 40  and would have gotten back in   when  After the market was up 10   20   30   At some point of emotional despair  Mr  Buy and Hold became Mr  Buy and Panic and might still not have recouped his losses 
That brings us to the latest fad   Do it Yourself on our Website   These are the new  robo investing  sites that tell you that you shouldn t pay someone else when you could be paying the robo site much less 
I believe a robo investing site that rebalances regularly but without any human understanding or input about market history  technical analysis  fundamental analysis as to the external economic environment  or behavioral analysis of investor and consumer sentiment is a dangerous place to be 
The problem with robo investing is that one  might  never experience as serious a loss as Mr  Buy and Hold  but Ms  Rebalance with Regularity will also never hold on long enough to enjoy long term sector outperformance  By selling on the basis of an arbitrarily selected date and a graven in stone universe of geographic stipulations  US  international  emerging market  etc   and or capitalization weights  US large cap  foreign mid cap  etc   one decides  in advance  to leave much on the table in exchange for not losing big  How much is too much 
Besides  if it isn t possible to beat the benchmarks  then what accounts for the steady outperformance over many years of some of my colleagues with whom I exchange ideas every month  By coincidence the latest issue of Gray Cardiff s Sound Investing just hit my inbox as I m writing this  In it  Gray notes that The Hulbert Financial Digest verifies that Sound Advice has earned 11 3  annually since 3 31 2000 versus 2 2  for the S P 500  And I should note  immodestly  that our own G V Portfolio has returned 9 4  annually versus the S P s 5  over a sightly longer period from 1 1 1999   My numbers include all S P dividends   Maybe Gray and I and all the other colleagues I credit in these pages from time to time have just been lucky for a decade or more  Or maybe it pays to have a human driver you  me  or someone else you trust  with a focus steadily on the road ahead and hands firmly on the wheel 
Here s what I see as I look down that road 
I expected great things from 2015 at the beginning of the year  It looked as if the economy was going to be able to stand on its own without Fed intervention  it was the third year of the presidential election cycle  a time when the party in power typically juices the economy and the markets  and it seemed as if China  India and Europe were all getting their act together  That s what it still looks like   in the rear view mirror  Looking ahead  however  I see   
The Hotel California in China

  Relax  said the night man   We are programmed to receive  
 You can check out any time you like  but you can never leave  

These last words from the Eagles 1977 hit song  Hotel California  pretty much sum up the state of things in China right now  You can buy all the stock you like  heck  they ll even encourage you to buy it on margin  But sell it  How dare you  That would bring the whole Ponzi scheme down in days    Hotel California  is actually a doubly appropriate reference here  according to the Eagles  the song is about the phoniness and materialism they encountered in L A  as they began to go from sort of known to hitting the big time  If the shoe fits  
At this point  the Chinese authorities have demanded internal records from Chinese and foreign brokerage firms who must prove they never helped fund or facilitate any short selling  accused a US hedge fund of plotting to bring down prices  instructed the large Chinese state owned companies with cash in the till to buy additional shares of Chinese companies  stopped all IPOs that may take funds away from current stock purchases  directed more state companies to invest in stocks rather than real estate  and  de facto  instructed Chinese pension funds and mutual funds to invest less in bonds and more in Chinese stocks  Heck  they even just devalued their currency 
That s a pretty Draconian reaction to a stock market correction that still leaves the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges solidly in the black for the year  Which leads me to wonder   what does the Chinese leadership know that we don t know  My best guess is that they know that the productivity  GDP  real estate values  labor and other numbers being sent out for public consumption are less than wonderful  Basically  they don t want anyone to look behind the curtain and see what Oz really looks like  We not only won t be buying this correction  we are now shorting China 
As Cnut   Canute    king of Denmark  England and Norway  is alleged to have said to his courtiers and toadies back in the 1020s or so  when they told him he was so powerful he could stop the incoming tide   No  I can t    Okay  what Henry of Huntingdon reports Cnut really said was  Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings  for there is none worthy of the name  but He whom heaven  earth and sea obey by eternal laws   In other words   No  I can t    It seems the autocrats and oligarchs that constitute China s elite Party members have yet to learn Cnut s humility  It may take a while to work out  but when it comes to choice between the dictates of rulers and market forces  I ll take market forces every time 
The Presidential Election Cycle
Typically  the year before a US Presidential election is a darn good one  And this may yet to prove to be  after we get through the dog days of summer  But for now things are not looking good 
Indeed  unless we can mount a rally in the next six to eight weeks  it may be a long cold winter that follows this long hot summer before we can get back to moving forward  That s because the markets hate uncertainty and the uncertainty markets hate most is which political scourge or savior will replace the current president and  by reflection  who he or she will select as their senior advisors and which representatives may be swept in on their coattails  The chart following is not graven in stone 
The chart below is only the average of all years since 1896  and it only reflects the Dow Industrials which may be disconnected from other benchmarks  Still  in the event this election cycle is somewhere near the average  it means we are in for a yawner for the next eight months or so  followed by a 2016 summer of discontent before we get the election uncertainty behind us and the market moves ahead smartly for a few months in the reflected glow of  Hope and Change  or whatever the next occupant at 1600 Pennsylvania has promised 

Please note that the quarter that ended June 30  bar 3 on  Year 3  above  was pretty much flat  not nearly as good as the  average   One might interpret this as meaning there is pent up demand  or that the handwriting is already on the wall for a queasy next few months  or that  pshaw  it s just a bunch of numerology that don t mean nuthin   I lean toward door  2  As a rapt student of market history  I ve lived through a lot of these  and that uncertainty thingy tends to get us every time  Not that there s anything uncertain about 17 Republican presidential candidates and at least 3  maybe more  Democratic candidates  with a strong likelihood that  if not selected  Mr  Trump s natural narcissism will cause him to run as an independent  continuing his clever way of telling us what we want to hear whether he believes it or not 
Yes  2016 could be complicated this time around 
The Fed  Greece  ISIS  Ukraine  Iran  Russia  Etc 
You don t really need me to re hash all these  do you  Any one of them could  continue to  create even more uncertainty  And  of course  there s always some economic or political event over the horizon that we can t see yet  So let s just move on to 
What Are We Doing About It 
We re reallocating our portfolio strategy to reflect what we believe to be the likelihood of a dull market that vacillates between heightened expectations and dashed expectations  That means lightening up on developing markets  energy  industrials  materials  utilities and even some technology firms 
It means keeping our health care exposure and adding a bit to the consumer discretionary sector  one of the few bright spots we see as American consumers  tired of belt tightening  loosen up a little and spend on something fun  It means looking for financials that will benefit as rates rise  which they inevitably will  We ll leave it to others to benefit via shorting Treasuries and so on  we ll instead buy insurers and regional banks that are already selling for single digit PEs  We ll buy some defensive issues in the food and beverage area  And we will hedge our longs with a couple of good inverse ETFs  To wit 
We will keep our Wisdom Tree Europe Hedged Equity  NYSE HEDJ  because I see continued strength in the US dollar  making euro exports relatively cheaper  but we will protect our gains with trailing stops  We ll sell all shares of Guggenheim S P 500 Pure Growth  NYSE RPG   however 
We ll keep our shares of Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSb  and add to them if prices continue to decline  and we ll trailing stop some shares of Wisdom Tree Germany  NASDAQ DXGE   We ll hold onto Marathon Petroleum  NYSE MPC  and BP  NYSE BP     for now 
At our cost basis and yield to cost  we ll hold Royal Bank of Scotland  LONDON RBS   NYSE RBS Q  until they force redemption upon us  which they will some day  We feel strongly about the fine portfolio of Tekla Health  NYSE THQ   even though it has done nothing so far  so it s a keeper  We ll add a bit to our Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   Even if the price of gold and silver don t recover  FNV is so well managed that I m certain there are price decline and bankruptcy provisions in the loans they make to smaller gold producers that will allow them to emerge from any gold price decline or range bound trading with a greater share of the gold that is actually produced  Gold won t stay down forever and it often does best in times of uncertainty 
As an income play  I like the preferreds of Public Storage  NYSE PSA   particularly the A  T and V preferreds  A better jobs picture means lots more mobility and relocation  Relocation means more people put stuff in storage   as do empty nesters downsizing and businesses that need a place to store inventory without taking on long term leases for more space  PSA is the class act in this industry so I see their preferreds  all yielding around 5   as a great way to invest for income without seeing anything more than a miniscule decline if US interest rates rise 
Since we have no real hedge against a serious market decline in this portfolio  I m also adding some shares of ProShares UltraShort S P 500  ARCA SDS   which moves inverse to the S P 500 at double the rate of movement  as well as shares of the iPath S P 500 VIX ETF  ARCA VXX   which is a reflection of the volatility I imagine we ll be seeing more of in the coming weeks and months 
Also we ll buy  not as a hedge for our long positions but as an outright short on hubris and autocracy  shares of Direxion CSI 300 China A Shares  NYSE CHAD   CHAD is an unleveraged short on the 300 largest and most liquid Chinese A Share companies  The Chinese government will do their best to thwart this investment but I say free markets will triumph and we could see rather large profits from this ETF 
Finally  we will buy one additional ETF  Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary  NYSE FDIS   While it is capitalization weighted  it covers the entire MSCI  Morgan Stanley Capital International  index so it also includes some non US firms that I believe will benefit from selling consumer discretionary goods and services to US consumers

117276,338791,PSA,The Un Beta Portfolio  Allocating Assets To Sidestep Declines,opinion,"If we are beginning a bear cycle   for which we are certainly overdue   even  defensive  stocks won t protect investors
One might take solace if the market is down 30  and they are  only  down 20 
But there is a better way  finding investments with little or no correlation to the typical benchmarks
I call it The UN Beta Portfolio

Last month I asked in these pages  Is This An Epic Bear Market Breach Or Flash In The Pan  My answer to the question is that no one really knows what millions of investors will do tomorrow or the next day  week or month  but the warning signs of impending volatility and disorder were indeed troubling 
Our response was to begin liquidating a substantial portion of our long portfolios and adding a like percentage of downside hedges  Those actions are now complete  We are roughly market neutral  But that doesn t mean we are willing to step away from the rewards the market itself can provide  even in a market neutral portfolio 
Over the last couple of decades  more than 70  of the total market return has come from dividend income  Much of this  dividend income  is really interest from fixed income investments packaged by ETFs and closed end funds and received as dividends  Some of it  as well  comes from preferred shares  where the income amount paid is fixed but  again  is considered dividend income 
So while we wait on the sidelines  fearing neither market ruin nor lamenting any loss of possible gain  we have created  The UN Beta Portfolio  for our clients and ourselves  Our  happy to stand by while things shake out in the next few months  holdings now look like this 
Up to 50  in fixed income  This includes sovereign bonds of developed nations that are now embarking on their own QE  keeping their bond yields low and creating a floor under their prices  investment grade US municipal bonds  and US multi sector bonds that have little or no correlation to US stocks and look like great holds if the Fed is constrained this year in raising rates  Of course  there are many venues to invest in fixed income assets  Our choices are typically bond mutual funds  bond closed end funds  and bond ETFs 
30  plus or minus long positions  Long  yes but here is where The UN Beta Portfolio differs from the typical long side portfolio  whether that other portfolio holds the FANGs  blue chips  or dividend aristocrats  No matter how wonderful the dividends of common stocks  it is all moot if the price of the stock plunges  Yes  you received 4 1  in a rock solid dividend  Too bad the company s shares plunged 25   Our longs in this portfolio are long short funds  which tend to have a modest long bias but offer great downside protection  preferred shares  which can fluctuate considerably in price but almost never as much as the issuing company s common stock  utilities that offer good yield and good valuation metrics  and REITs that are typically underwhelming in frothy bull markets and thus cheap today 
10  cash   long special situations or favored sectors  If we don t find sectors we like in the bad times  we stay in cash  There will always be some special situation that comes along worthy of our consideration  but they may stay in the portfolio for only a very short period of time 
No more than 10  in various short positions  primarily against US small and mid caps and  especially  emerging markets  The latter have been on fire lately as Brazil and Argentina are talking nice to creditors and China is pulling out all the stops to keep its house of cards from tumbling down  We have taken this opportunity to add to positions 
Manning the Battlements
Here are some examples of specific holdings in each of the areas we have decided to invest in 
One example of a mutual fund we are buying to take advantage of the floor under sovereign nation debt created by decling rates dictated by their central bankers is the PIMCO Foreign Bond  US Dollar Hedged  Fund  PFOAX   PFODX   If you use Morningstar  you might think this fund has serious style drift since 63  of its holdings are listed as being in the USA  Upon closer inspection  however  you will see that  while PFOAX s charter allows them much flexibility based upon their experienced market analysis  they aren t really that heavy in the US  What they actually hold are interest rate swaps issued in the US that allow them to hedge their foreign bond positions  In fact  most of their holdings are in developed nation foreign government bonds  Since inception  this fund has blown the doors off the international bond category and currently pays a 6 5  yield 
Among the myriad closed end and ETF municipal offerings  one of the ETFs we are buying  particularly for those clients who need AMT free income  is PowerShares National AMT Free Muni Bond  NYSE PZA   While it only pays a 3 6  yield  if you are in a high bracket and subject to the IRS s Alternative Minimum Tax  the after tax yield equivalent is considerably better  In the closed end space  one of our favorites is the BlackRock Investment Quality Municipals Fund  NYSE BKN   Yielding 5 6  all from income  none from return of capital more than 80  of its holdings are in the top 3 rating categories 
While we re at it  let s discuss an old shibboleth about municipals  For years  advisors of many stripes have told investors there is no value in buying municipals unless you are in a high tax bracket and there is  certainly  no value in buying them in an IRA  It s true that you derive no tax advantage to buying munis in an IRA  But many of our clients and readers have only IRA accounts  Would I deprive them of a high quality  low volatility 5 6  yield in troubled times  Of course not 
If they have both a non tax advantaged account and an IRA  I d suggest you buy in the former the after tax equivalent  for example  for a married couple making  100 000 a year and paying a 6  state income tax in the state of issue of the municipal on top of their 25  federal rate would be 8   not 5 6   But many retired investors are in lower brackets and wouldn t see that much difference  Always do your due diligence and let the  experts  maintain their illusions 
A US bond fund that looks a lot better now that it is less likely the Fed will go wild on rate increases this year would be PIMCO Income Class A and Class D   PONAX and PONDX  PONAX is a  multi sector  fund  which means it can buy sovereign bonds  corporate bonds  agency bonds  or any other kind of debt security and they can do it anywhere in the world  They have chosen  however  to specialize in US non agency mortgage debt  Good timing  As US lenders have tightened up the qualifications for home buyers  the quality of holdings available for purchase today is higher than it was in the recent past  But since many possible bond buyers are still wary  the yields are particularly good this goes for residential as well as commercial mortgages 
The steadiness of its mortgage  sovereign  US and foreign bond payments allows PONAX to pay a monthly dividend  In order never to pay out too much  the current monthly payout is augmented at year end by an extra dividend  PONAX PONDX has done this successfully for years without ever once paying any return of capital  what they pay out is what they have earned  nothing more 
I have a number of other favorites in this area but  for now  I ll just discuss one other PIMCO fund  While PIMCO lost investor assets when guru Bill Gross left in a huff  their performance certainly hasn t suffered one bit  It seems the impact of Mr  Gross leaving was every bit as large as the hole left behind when one sticks their finger in a glass of water and then removes it 
This one is PIMCO s Mortgage Opportunities  with my preferred asset classes being the A and D shares  PMZAX   PMZDX   As the name implies  PMZAX operates in the commercial and residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities arena  Given investor fears  I believe unwarranted  of a repeat of a 2007 2008 housing bubble  these bonds trade at a discount to other equally rated bonds  PMZAX invests primarily in the US and European markets and has the right by charter to hedge   short in order to mitigate risks  PMZAX is a relatively new fund  but one I think is on the right track to protect us in difficult markets 
Finally  for this article anyway  I ll discuss just a couple of the many preferred shares we own in our UN Beta Portfolio  Preferreds tend to pay slightly better than bonds  and preferred shareholders are lower in the hierarchy of creditors who get paid off in the event of a corporate bankruptcy   They are issued by corporations and may have a fixed date or be issued in perpetuity 
With preferreds  you need to be reasonably certain that the underlying company has a clean balance sheet and a good future  I like banks  insurers and REITs the best for our preferred portfolio  Some of my favorites are every single preferred issued by Public Storage  NYSE PSA   Some symbols are PSA A  T  U  and V 
My most recent purchase has been the  J  preferred from NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NextEra is the parent company of  among many other subsidiaries  Florida Power and Light which  thanks to NEE s leadership  just reduced its rates  unheard of these days 
And  finally  if you don t want the bother of watching these and don t like their relative illiquidity people buy them to hold  so the trading volume tends to be small take a look at two ETFs  PowerShares Financial Preferred  NYSE PGF  and PowerShares Preferred Portfolio  NYSE PGX    Our clients mostly own the preferreds themselves  not the ETFs  
I ll discuss other fine holdings in The UN Beta Portfolio in future articles  If you here  you ll likely sleep better if the market declines and only miss some of the gains if it roars ahead 
Personally  I don t mind a bit stepping aside from the long side of the market  and have done so many times in the past  When the bear cycle is upon us  Wall Street can yammer on all they like about  defensive  holdings  but by now I m sure you realize that s what we financial professionals call  in technical terms   a bunch of hooey  
Wall Street will tell you that food and beverage firms are defensive because  people gotta eat  or that housing stocks are defensive because  everyone has to have a place to live   Maybe so  But no one has to pay 20 times earnings for the privilege of owning these stocks  And in most bear cycles  if the stocks  P Es decline from 20 to 10  that takes your stock from a price of 30 to 15 or 80 to 40  for example  That  to me  is not defensive  It is merely bleeding slowly rather than watch your life s blood exit all at once 
We don t believe in hemorrhaging when the market is down  Eating well and sleeping well no matter how steep the correction is the best revenge

117306,338821,PSA,IYR At A Possible Bounce Level,opinion,The iShares Dow Jones US Real Estate ETF  IYR  tracks the Dow Jones U S  Real Estate Index  It is comprise of 64 real estate related stocks  Simon Property Group  SPG   Public Storage  PSA   Essex Property Trust  ESS   just to name a few  What led me to look at IYR is that it s been down for 5 days in a row and from a numbers perspective the ETF is oversold at current levels  Currently only 11  of the stocks within the ETF are above their 10 day moving average  and only 14  are above their 50 day moving average  Because ETFs are mean reverting vehicles  this type of set up has a high probability of a 1 3 day dead cat bounce  if it opens lower today  the probability increases  But what I also noticed is that on the weekly chart   IYR is back to a level that used to be resistance but can very well act as support the first time around  especially after 5 consecutive down closes  That resistance level also coincides with its rising 50 week moving average  the  62 50  62 70 level  There are different ways to play this set up  make sure to consult your financial advisor  guru  broker Disclosure  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2012-11-14,Frank Zorrilla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iyr-at-a-possible-bounce-level-143463,143463
