107946,329461,BKNG,Takeaway CEO has no plans to raise  5 5 billion Just Eat bid,news,"By Paul Sandle and Toby Sterling
BARCELONA AMSTERDAM  Reuters    Takeaway com  AS TKWY  Chief Executive Jitse Groen said on Wednesday he did not intend to increase a 4 3 billion pound   5 5 billion  offer for Britain s  Just Eat   L JE   despite a higher unsolicited bid from larger rival  Prosus   AS PRX  
A Takeaway Just Eat tie up  which is backed by Just Eat s boards  would create more value in the long run  Groen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Barcelona 
Asked whether he would sweeten the bid  Groen said   no  
 The combination is the new Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  com  for investors that is the thing to think about   he said  referring to the online service that grew to dominate its sector by offering the largest selection of hotels and an easy to use ordering app 
Groen  who owns 25  of Takeaway himself  said the deal has  a lot  of support from Just Eat shareholders 
 Because they are the same shareholders  there s a lot of overlap  People know our track record   he said 
Prosus s cash offer of 710 pence values Just Eat at around  6 3 billion and is currently 12  higher than Takeaway s all share offer of 634 pence  Just Eat shares were trading at 734 4 pence at 1204 GMT  a signal investors still believe a higher offer is on the cards 
Investor Cat Rock  which holds 5 69  of Takeaway shares and 2 6  of Just Eat  has said it backs the merger and opposes the Prosus bid as insufficient 
However  Aberdeen Standard Investments and Eminence Capital with 4 92  and 4 26  of Just Eat respectively have said they consider the Takeaway offer too low 
Prosus  which has argued it has more resources to invest after poor third quarter results from Just Eat  responded on Wednesday by saying that Takeaway underestimates  the level of investment required in a sector that is changing rapidly  
 Ours is the only offer that provides the certainty of cash to shareholders at an attractive and fair value   it said 
Takeaway also said on Wednesday it would introduce Takeaway s branded delivery service in Britain and combine the two companies  IT systems to save on costs 
Those changes would cost  tens of millions  of euros in the short term but would strengthen the combination s competitive position and lead to long term growth  it added ",2019-11-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/takeaway-ceo-has-no-plans-to-raise-55-billion-just-eat-bid-2019689,2019689

107951,329466,BKNG,Stocks   Wall Street Rebounds as Virus Fear Eases  Delphi Soars,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    Wall Street opened with a bounce on Tuesday after its worst daily loss in more than three months on Monday  as fears about the novel coronavirus in China abated somewhat 
The market was undeterred by a durable goods report that suggested defense was the only sector that really enjoyed the end of 2019  Core orders excluding defense goods fell 2 5  on the month in December and November s figures were revised down to 0 5  drop from a 0 7  increase reported originally 
Those figures cast something of a shadow over the Federal Reserve s policy meeting  which is due to get under way later Tuesday  but chimed with a quarterly report from   Lockheed Martin    NYSE LMT   the U S  s biggest defense contractor  that showed profit up nearly 20  from a year earlier  thanks in part to rising sales of the F35 combat jet  Lockheed stock was up 1 0  at a new all time high 
By contrast  industrial giant 3M  NYSE MMM  fell 3 5  to a six week low after saying it will cut 1 500 jobs worldwide as it comes to terms with sluggish demand out of Asia  The company s fourth quarter profit fell 28  due to litigation and restructuring charges 
By 9 50 AM ET  1445 GMT   the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 85 points  or 0 3   while the S P 500 was up 0 5  and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0 7  
Among the biggest movers were auto parts supplier Delphi  which surged 61  after rival BorgWarner  NYSE BWA  announced it would buy the company in an all stock deal valuing at  3 3 billion  BorgWarner s stock fell 7 3  on perceptions that it is overpaying 
Elsewhere  Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  fell 2 7  to a three month low after a quarterly report that again showed its core motorcycle business in an apparently irreversible decline in the U S   even if it forecast flat revenues for the key division this year

107952,329467,BKNG,Virus fears draw value investors to travel  casino stocks,news,"By David Randall
NEW YORK  Reuters    As travel and casino stocks reel from concerns over the coronavirus outbreak  some value focused investors are betting the declines will not last 
British Airways has suspended flights to mainland China and economists have warned of a major impact to the world s second largest economy  as deaths from the flu like virus stood at around 170 Thursday  The number of visitors to Macau  the world s largest casino hub  has fallen by 69  since Friday  according to the local government data released this week 
Fund managers say outbreak concerns have only exacerbated pressure on these stocks  which had already been hit by the trade war between the United States and China  Fears of a widening health crisis have sent shares of companies such as Las Vegas Sands Corp and Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  Holdings Inc down more than 8  since the start of the month  Short interest in both companies is well below their 52 week highs  a sign that fewer investors see deeper declines ahead 
 They really are a slave to headline risk right now   said Charles Norton  a co manager of the Vitium Global Fund   We think there s a lot of value here  
Norton is increasing his position in companies with high exposure to Macau  such as MGM Resorts International due to the rising consumer class in China and infrastructure improvements that will make it easier for mainland Chinese to travel to the region 
Shares of the company are down 7 6  since the start of the year and trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 21  slightly below that of the broad S P 500  according to Refinitiv data 
Bryan Engler  a senior equity analyst at Kovitz Investment Group in Chicago  said his firm is bullish on online travel sites such as  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  Group Inc and Booking Holdings  which have faltered on concerns that worldwide travel will slow yet have strong balance sheets and high returns on capital 
 There s a piece of me that hopes there is a little more volatility  These are the type of businesses we love and we would love to buy them cheaper   Engler said 
Eric Marshall  a portfolio manager at Dallas based Hodges Capital  said that his firm is increasing its position in Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd   Shares of Delta are down 4 7  for the month and trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 7 8  about half of that of the S P 500 as a whole  Norwegian  meanwhile  is down 9 1  for the month and trades at a trailing P E of 12 6 
 The market is capitulating on these stocks and if you think that the concerns about the virus will be more muted in a year then they re probably a good buy   he said ",2020-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/virus-fears-draw-value-investors-to-travel-casino-stocks-2072149,2072149
107953,329468,BKNG,StockBeat  Worldline  Ingenico Aim to Catch up Nimbler Rivals,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    France s two biggest payments companies  announced the creation of a new European champion in the space on Monday  after Worldline  PA WLN  agreed to pay some 7 8 billion euros   8 6 billion  for   Ingenico    PA INGC  
While that s true in a narrow sense   the two companies had total revenue of 5 3 billion euros in 2019  according to figures they both released on Monday   the reality is a little more prosaic  Ingenico is paying the price for not moving fast enough beyond its legacy business   the card payment terminals seen in shops all over Europe   and into the online retail payments space 
Although Ingenico has made progress in the last year   organic sales growth of 10  actually exceeded Worldline s 6 9     the perception is still that it is not in the hottest part of a sector that is still growing rapidly  Ingenico stock was up only around 10  from its levels of five years ago at Friday s close 
One of the reasons Worldline is buying Ingenico  rather than the other way round  is that Worldline stock is valued at over four times sales  more than twice the valuation of Ingenico stock   That has given Worldline the luxury of being able to offer its stock as part of the deal 
The relative valuations suggest not too much should be read into the 4 6  drop in Worldline stock on Monday  The 17  premium it s offering over Ingenico s Friday close is not egregious by the usual standards  and easily justifiable  if one extrapolates the convincing rebound that Ingenico stock has had in the last 12 months as its diversification has started to bear fruit under new chief executive Nicolas Huss 
However  the combined company will have some work to do if it wants to match the valuation of  Adyen    AS ADYEN   the Dutch based company that floated in 2018  It was still growing sales at a clip of 64  in the six months through last June  thanks to strong links with likes of Uber  NYSE UBER   Spotify  NYSE SPOT  and Booking  NASDAQ BKNG   all big beasts in online payments 
At 25 billion euros  Adyen is still worth over 25  more than the combined value of Worldline Ingenico   Even Germany s Wirecard  DE WDIG   after all the knocks it has suffered due to governance concerns over the last two years  is still valued at only a touch less than the new French giant  Again  that s due to its relative strength in areas where growth is faster  although Wirecard s strength is regional  Asia  rather than sectoral 
Bulking up is a process that will give the French companies greater clout vis   vis smaller competitors  Italy s Nexi  MI NEXII   for example  rose 3 5  on Monday as market participants added a little takeover premium to the stock   But for the term  champion  to mean anything  the combined company will have to show that it can grow at least as fast as the broader sector   It still has some convincing to do ",2020-02-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-worldline-ingenico-aim-to-catch-up-nimbler-rivals-2074202,2074202
107980,329495,BKNG,Facebook executive confident Libra will win enough financial backers,news,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON  Reuters     Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   whose digital currency project Libra has been abandoned by several high profile partners including PayPal  Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA   still expects to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once it addresses regulatory concerns  the head of the project said on Wednesday 
 It will take time for us to address all of the regulatory concerns that were raised and it s our duty and our responsibility to come with answers to all of these questions   head of Libra David Marcus told a panel at the International Monetary Fund  IMF  conference in Washington 
 I think once we ve done this then I think we ll see more banks and traditional financial services firms join the effort   Marcus said  adding it was harder for large  regulated financial firms to  take an active part in this fight right now  given the climate and the pressure  
Facebook s ambitious efforts to establish a global digital currency have suffered severe setbacks in recent days  Other key members to pull out included Stripe  eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  and Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  Holdings Inc   PayPal Holdings Inc   NASDAQ PYPL  said it was leaving earlier this month 
The exodus followed intense skepticism from global policymakers and regulators in the United States and Europe who worry Libra could upend the global financial system  threaten users  privacy and facilitate money laundering 
Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard reiterated those concerns on Wednesday  saying at a separate event in Washington that the Libra project  must address a core set of legal and regulatory challenges  before it can go live 
Facebook is left without the backing of any major payments firms for the project  due to launch by June 2020 
Speaking at the IMF event  Marcus said around 1 600 entities globally had initially expressed an interest in joining the project and that Libra should have  no problem  reaching its goal of launching with 100 members 
On Monday  the Libra Association s 21 remaining members forged ahead  holding their inaugural meeting in Geneva and selecting a five member board 




Marcus said it was now in Libra s hands to run a process to select more members  He added that Libra also needed time to build up its staff to address the regulatory issues  rather than Facebook  carrying that flag  ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/facebook-libra-should-have-no-problem-getting-100-members-on-board-by-launch-executive-1997155,1997155
107981,329496,BKNG,Facebook open to currency pegged stablecoins for Libra project,news,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON  Reuters     Facebook Inc   O FB   facing growing skepticism about its digital currency project Libra  on Sunday said the initiative could use cryptocurrencies based on national currencies such as the dollar  instead of the synthetic one it initially proposed 
David Marcus  who heads the Libra project for Facebook  told a banking seminar the group s main goal remained to create a more efficient payments system  but it was open to looking at alternative approaches for the currency token it would use 
 We could do it differently   he said   Instead of having a synthetic unit     we could have a series of stablecoins  a dollar stablecoin  a euro stablecoin  a sterling pound stable coin  etc   Marcus told the panel 
 We could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenized digital form   he said   That is one of the options that should be considered  
Marcus said he was not suggesting currency pegged stablecoins were the group s new preferred option 
 What we care about is the mission and there are a number ways to go about this   Marcus told Reuters after the panel  adding that the Libra needed to  demonstrate a lot of agility  
The Facebook led project suffered severe setbacks earlier this month  as major payment companies Mastercard Inc  N MA  and  Visa Inc   N V  became the latest partners to quit the group behind the project 
Other key members that have pulled out included Stripe  eBay Inc  O EBAY  and Booking Holdings Inc  O BKNG  and  PayPal Holdings Inc   O PYPL  
Global policymakers and regulators have also worry that creation of a new synthetic global currency could upend the global financial system  threaten users  privacy  and facilitate money laundering 
Group of 20 finance leaders on Friday agreed to set strict regulations on cryptocurrencies and said such stablecoins should not be issued until various global risks were addressed 
Marcus told Reuters that Facebook was still aiming for a June 2020 launch of Libra  but acknowledged it could miss that target due to regulatory hurdles 
 We ll see  That s still the goal   Marcus told Reuters when asked if the recent departure of several major partners from the project would delay the planned 2020 launch 




 We ve always said that we wouldn t go forward unless we have addressed all legitimate concerns and get proper regulatory approval  So it s not entirely up to us   he said ",2019-10-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/facebook-open-to-currencypegged-stablecoins-for-libra-project-1999890,1999890

NEW YORK  Reuters    Etihad Airways  the United Arab Emirates  national carrier  said on Thursday it has teamed up with open source travel platform Winding Tree to explore using blockchain to distribute products and services without the need for third parties such as Sabre 
Etihad is one of several airlines and hotels that have partnered with Switzerland based Winding Tree over the last few years to bypass intermediaries using the distributed ledger technology  Those include  Air Canada   TO AC   Air France KLM  PA AIRF   and Lufthansa  DE LHAG   as well as aviation services company Swissport  and hotels such as Nordic Choice  citizenM Hotel chain  and Airport Hotel Basel 
 Winding Tree is obviously our distribution  platform  and that s an opportunity for us to disrupt a traditionally siloed market dominated by major distribution systems   Tristan Thomas  Etihad s director of digital and innovation  said in a phone interview 
 Very few have chosen to disrupt the distribution world and that s because those are major players with very significant margins that have acted to keep that kind of a closed shop  
Currently  global distribution systems  GDS  such as Amadeus and Sabre employ real time inventory technology to compile data on flights and rooms for travel agents or corporate travel bookers 
Winding Tree s platform will allow corporates and institutions like airlines and hotels to publish available inventory to those customers directly 
GDS is also used by consumer facing websites such as Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  com and  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  
While the platform is not aimed at retail consumers  the fact that intermediaries  fees are being bypassed ultimately means lower costs  Pedro Anderson  Winding Tree s chief operating officer and co founder  told Reuters 
 Anybody who has traveled today knows that it s not the most pleasant experience  The entire process is backwards   he said

The remaining members of the Libra Association  a nonprofit that would manage the cryptocurrency  planned to meet Monday in Geneva  Switzerland to finalize its governing charter and initial membership 
Libra came under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators as soon as Facebook announced the project  Regulators warned that the cryptocurrency  originally set to launch next year  could be used by criminals if not properly monitored  while lawmakers pilloried Facebook s track record at hearings in July with Libra co founder David Marcus 
Officials in some countries  including Germany and France  announced that they would ban Libra  saying that the currency could be a threat to monetary policy  among other concerns 
Visa  Mastercard and Stripe left the project shortly after receiving a letter from Democratic senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio  warning that they could face increased scrutiny if they stayed on board 
Brian Armstrong  the CEO of Libra member Coinbase Inc   on Sunday said the pressure felt  un American    Why the need for the intimidation tactics  This would be called anti competitive monopolistic behavior if any private company did it   Armstrong wrote on Twitter 
In the face of the departures  Libra has said more than 1 500 companies have expressed interest in joining the association and that the currency wouldn t launch until it satisfied regulators  concerns 
Developers have continued to advance the open source code that would underlie Libra  However  Visa  Mastercard and PayPal could have provided critical experience in navigating U S  financial regulators  concerns  making their departures particularly painful  Booking Holdings  which has a market capitalization of more than  84 billion  was among the only remaining large  publicly held companies left in the project

108062,329577,BKNG,Booking Holdings shares fall 10 percent after weak Europe outlook,news,"By Ankit Ajmera
 Reuters    Shares of Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  Holdings Inc fell more than 10 percent in early trading on Thursday  after the U S  online travel agency said it was seeing a sharp demand slowdown in Europe  its biggest market 
The company  which gets more than two thirds of its sales from Europe  said uncertainties related to Brexit and political issues in France lead it to forecast lower first quarter room bookings 
 While we acknowledge that many of the factors causing the slowdown are unrelated to BKNG s execution  there was little indication on the call that European travel demand would reaccelerate any time soon   Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said 
The company  whose brands include Booking com  Priceline and Agoda  forecast first quarter room bookings to grow between 6 percent and 8 percent  compared with a more than 13 percent growth recorded a year earlier 
Chief Executive Officer Glenn Fogel said the trade war between the United States and China was making conditions worse for European economies including Germany  whose slowing automotive industry was weighing on Europe s overall growth 
 People are uncertain   Fogel said  as they ponder over questions such as  Should I spend a lot of money right now or not  I don t know if there are going to be troubles traveling into Europe  
The weak outlook led multiple brokerages to cut price targets on Booking Holdings  stock  following the company s fourth quarter results on Wednesday 
Cowen   Co cut its price target on the company s stock by  300 to  2 000  RBC Capital Markets by  275 to  2150  Wedbush by  100 to  2 000 and Jefferies by  40 to  1900 
 The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has significantly impacted booking trends among British consumers  as concerns over both passport requirements and currency devaluation led to travel related concerns   Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said

SYDNEY  Reuters    The South Pacific nation of Tonga has been all but cut off from the internet this week after an undersea cable connecting the archipelago to the wider world was severed twice on Sunday  throwing communications across the tiny and isolated country into chaos 
The outage  which the cable s owner said may have been caused by a ship s anchor  also knocked out overseas phone calls and is hampering money transfers  airline bookings  university enrolments as well as Facebook  NASDAQ FB  connections to family and friends 
In the capital  Nuku alofa  a satellite dish was hastily mounted on Monday to provide limited and slow backup connectivity  prompting hundreds of people to queue outside a government telecom office where the signal is most reliable 
 It s like going back to the beginning of the internet   Tonga police spokeswoman Sia Adams said on the phone 
 You just wait for your turn to have your 20 minutes to access   it s currently hot here in Tonga at the moment but they ve put up a tent outside  with chairs  so people can wait  
Hours have been extended to midnight to handle crowds of officials  business people and ordinary folk logging on to access cash remittances  buy plane tickets and  just chat  said Filimone Iloa  an employee at Tonga Communications Corporation 
The problem illustrates the vulnerability of undersea fiber optic cables  which with a data carrying capacity some 200 times that of satellites have become the backbone of global communications  Broken cables left Somalia without internet for weeks in 2017 and cut off parts of Egypt and India in 2008

 We haven t really ascertained the cause  but most likely it was a boat with an anchor has dragged the cable  or something of this sort   he said 
Piukala happened to be at a telecom industry meeting in Hawaii when the breaks occurred  and so was able to quickly arrange the backup satellite link  though he said it could only provide about a tenth of the cable s capacity

108139,329654,BKNG,Travel industry eyes blockchain potential for fees  delays  lost bags,news,"By Victoria Bryan BERLIN  Reuters    Blockchain technology has the potential to shake up the travel industry by giving airlines and hotels a way to bypass controlling intermediaries like  Expedia   O EXPE  or  Amadeus   MC AMA  and gain better access to customer data  Major players including Lufthansa  DE LHAG  and citizenM hotels are partnering with startups and talking to large corporate clients about whether they can do group bookings via blockchain instead of using middlemen  who charge up to 25 percent of ticket or room prices in fees  Blockchain  which functions as an online record keeping system maintained by a group of peers rather than a central agency or authority  also offers new business opportunities in tracking bags and flight delays  Because transaction data is openly available and not controlled by any one party  blockchain offers an opportunity to build new platforms that can connect travel providers and customers more directly and replace decades old technology   We see a lot of business potential from the very nature of blockchain being decentralized by construction  removing the middleman by design  That looks very fruitful potentially   Xavier Lagardere  head of distribution at Lufthansa Group Hub Airlines told Reuters   The travel industry joins financial  mining  energy trading firms and others in looking at the potential for blockchain technology when it comes to simplifying processes  cutting out middlemen or tracking goods  One travel blockchain company that has partnered with major players including Lufthansa  Air New Zealand  NZ AIR  and Netherlands based citizenM hotels  is Swiss non profit Winding Tree  whose distribution platform is so far targeting companies rather than consumers  It allows airlines and hotels to publish available inventory to customers without needing systems that aggregate data on flights and rooms  and could therefore allow them to avoid the fees they currently pay for the use of such systems   Currently such systems are provided by intermediaries like global distribution systems  GDS  providers Sabre  O SABR   Amadeus  and Travelport  N TVPT   whose real time inventory technology is used by travel agents or corporate travel bookers  or consumer facing online travel agencies  OTA  like Booking Holdings  O BKNG  and Expedia Group   Reducing commission fees  which can reach up to 25 percent of the price of a hotel room for example  is an ongoing battle  as is access to customer data  with some airlines complaining that they don t get passenger contact details from third parties  crucial when delays occur   Hotels group Marriott  O MAR  this month said it was looking to lower the commission it pays to online travel agencies  starting with Expedia  Lufthansa in 2015 introduced a fee for bookings made via GDS companies  of 16 euros  and its rivals IAG  L ICAG  and Air France KLM  PA AIRF  have also renegotiated contracts  Winding Tree CEO Maksim Izmaylov said the travel intermediaries may have to adjust their business models as a result of the new technology  mainly by rethinking their fees   Those big companies don t have to go away but the rules of the game are changing   Izmaylov said  adding Winding Tree wanted to collaborate with the intermediaries too   He said OTAs could be forced to drop their fees to around 5 percent from levels of around 20 to 25 percent currently   GDS companies  the first of which were created by the airline industry in the 1960s  have put on a brave face  saying they offer more services and real time pricing for distribution that blockchain technology couldn t provide    There will always be a need for someone to aggregate offers and enable multi sourced shopping  I don t think blockchain resolves that   Philip Likens  director of Sabre Labs  told Reuters  His comments were echoed by representatives of Amadeus  Travelport and technology company SITA  Tony Hird  VP Enterprise Business Architecture at Travelport  also said transactions using blockchain were not as fast as traditional methods    You can t have a real time environment if you have to wait 10 minutes for the transaction to be committed   he said   Ctrip  O CTRP   China s biggest online travel company  is looking into blockchain itself  though  like others  said the computing power is lacking at the moment    Right now  retrieving blockchain codes takes a long time  so the efficiency needs to be increased and the cost needs to go down   Ctrip CEO Jane Jie Sun said   Booking com CEO Gillian Tans said blockchain could make it easier for the company to connect to properties and attractions    Eventually customers will benefit from that as well   she told Reuters   TRACKING BAGS  DELAYS AND PEOPLE Meanwhile  travel technology companies are exploring how they can use blockchain themselves to provide new services to their customers  although they are being careful of the hype    We want to be diligent to find the best applications for this technology  It can become a problem that blockchain is the new fancy hammer and we re looking for a nail   Sabre Labs  Likens said   Air transport technology specialist SITA has worked with Heathrow Airport and British Airways owner IAG to test whether blockchain could be used for sharing of flight data and to keep passengers updated   Kevin O Sullivan  lead engineer at SITA Lab  said it was hard to nail down what the status of a flight was when you have two airports and one airline involved in any individual flight  each with its own operating database    If you have the top 50 to 100 airlines and airports putting data on blockchain  then you have a masterset for the industry that s consistent and managed by industry governance rules for flight status  That would solve a genuine problem   he said    Because it s blockchain we know there s a single version of the data shared with all the parties and crucially everyone knows they re looking at the same data set    Sara Pavan  head of Amadeus Innovation Partnership  said baggage tracking  loyalty programs  passenger identification and cross border payments were all areas where blockchain could prove useful

108173,329688,BKNG,Why Booking Holdings  BKNG  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG   This company  which is in the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this online booking service has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 2 28   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Booking Holdings came out with earnings of  45 36 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  44 87 per share  representing a surprise of 1 09   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  22 80 per share and it actually produced earnings of  23 59 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 46  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Booking Holdings lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Booking Holdings currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 32   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-booking-holdings-bkng-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200501898,200501898

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Booking Holdings has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while MONOTARO has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that BKNG s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
BKNG currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 36  while MONOY has a forward P E of 50 22  We also note that BKNG has a PEG ratio of 1 24  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MONOY currently has a PEG ratio of 2 63

Shares Plunge After Disappointing Q3 Earnings
Last month  Expedia reported underwhelming earnings for its fiscal 2019 third quarter  Non GAAP earnings of  3 38 per share lagged way behind the consensus estimate of  3 80  its bottom line also slumped 7  year over year  Revenue managed to grow 9  to  3 56 billion but also missed analysts  expectations 
One of the factors that hit Expedia hard was a 10  year over year decrease in average revenue per ticket  management said this was due to a  reclassification of certain partner fees to other revenue and a shift in product mix  
As a result  shares plunged more than 25  after the report was released  EXPE is now down almost 10  year to date compared to the S P 500 s nearly 30  gain Analysts have since turned bearish on Expedia  with 11 cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 80 cents during that same time period from  6 99 to  6 19 per share  This sentiment has stretched into 2020  and our consensus estimate has fallen over one dollar in the past two months 
EXPE is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Looking Ahead
Expedia now expects full year adjusted EBITDA to increase 5  to 8   down from previous forecasts of 12  to 15  growth  due to both the company s hotel booking website Trivago and its home and vacation rental platform VRBO having reduced profitability outlooks 
For those investors looking to add a travel industry peer to their portfolio  they could consider Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  Holdings  BKNG   The online travel company expects earnings growth of 9 5  for 2019

Also  favorable mix in Otis new equipment orders is likely to be a tailwind for the commercial business  However  the company is experiencing softness in its equipment orders at the Carrier segment due to persistent lower transport refrigeration orders  Also  rising cost of sales has been a major cause of concern 
Rise in debt levels can increase its financial obligations  Moreover  the company expects forex headwind to hurt its revenues and segmental operating profits by  550 million and  75 million  respectively  in 2019

membership fees and impressive e commerce sales bode well for the company  Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered The stock has been gaining from sturdy comps and decent results  The company posted positive earnings and sales surprise in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  Notably  the top and the bottom line continued to register year over year improvement  Certainly  Costco seems somewhat unfazed by a tough retail scenario The company s efforts have been driving traffic across online and brick and mortar platforms  However  any incremental investments or aggressive pricing strategy may hurt margins  Moreover  rising SG A expenses and stiff competition also pose concerns Shares of Booking Holdings have gained 8 9  in the past six months against the Zacks Internet Commerce industry s decline of 8 7   The Zacks analyst believes that Booking Holdings is riding on improving gross bookings  The company continues to witness solid growth in the booked room nights Its rising mobile share and growing accommodation business are aiding total room nights  bookings  Further  solid efforts toward ramping up of merchant business remain positive  We believe a secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and increasing mobile usage penetration are tailwinds Moreover  the company s strong

Moreover  macro headwinds  increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax related litigation remain concerns  PNC Financial s shares have gained 3 9  over the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s rise of 4 3   The Zacks analyst believes the company s third quarter results reflect robust organic growth  partially offset by higher expenses and provisions The company s commitment to expand middle market lending franchise and expand its digital products and services offerings bodes well  Moreover  execution of inorganic strategies in order to diversify revenue sources is likely to continue bolstering fee income However  with growing business and investment in technology  its expense base is expected to keep rising  Also  lack of diversification in loan

108279,329794,BKNG,Booking Holdings  BKNG  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"The market expects Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This online booking service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  44 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 7  
Revenues are expected to be  5 07 billion  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Booking Holdings 
For Booking Holdings  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Booking Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Booking Holdings would post earnings of  22 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  23 59  delivering a surprise of  3 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line

108280,329795,BKNG,Booking Holdings  BKNG  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This online booking service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  44 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 8  
Revenues are expected to be  5 08 billion  up 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 31  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Booking Holdings 
For Booking Holdings  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Booking Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Booking Holdings would post earnings of  22 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  23 59  delivering a surprise of  3 46  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Citigroup  C   Novo Nordisk  CSE NOVOb   NVO  and BP  LON BP   BP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Citigroup s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry year to date  40 2  vs  24 3    The Zacks analyst believes that third quarter results reflected revenue strength  along with rising loan and deposit balance 
Also  escalated investment banking revenues and reduced volumes and client activity levels were recorded in the quarter  Citigroup s streamlining efforts  along with strategic investments in core business  bode well for the long term  Also  a declining cost base will support bottom line improvement 
Citigroup s steady capital deployment activities are also commendable depicting a strong capital position  However  pending litigation issues might keep legal expenses elevated  Further  decline in fee income is another concern for the company

Shares of Novo Nordisk have gained 13 3  in the past six months against the Zacks Biotech industry s rise of 4 3   The Zacks analyst believes that solid performances from Tresiba  Victoza  Ozempic  Xultophy and Saxenda have driven the company s sales in the year so far 
Label expansion of Victoza continues to boost performance   Ozempic  the company s once weekly GLP 1  continues to gain market share  The FDA recently approved semaglutide in tablet form under the brand name  Rybelsus  The company continues to evaluate the candidate for multiple indications 
However  lower realized prices in the Unites States  loss of exclusivity for products in hormone replacement therapy and intensifying competition within the diabetes and biopharmaceuticals markets will adversely impact sales going forward  
 You can  
BP s shares have lost 1 4  over the past three months against the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry s fall of 1 9   The Zacks analyst believes that BP has been gaining from a strong portfolio of upstream projects 
Since 2016  BP has placed 23 key upstream developments online  which will help the British energy giant boost production by 900 thousand barrel of oil equivalent per day  MBOE D  by 2021  In fact  production from these key projects has helped the integrated energy major report better than expected earnings for the third quarter  Moreover  the company is strongly committed toward returning cash to its shareholders 
However  the 2010 oil spill incident in the BP operated Macondo Prospect is still affecting the firm  Although BP has cleared the huge litigation expenses related to the spill  it had to divest some of its best operating properties  Also  the company expects refining margins in the December quarter of 2019 to drop sequentially owing to continued turnaround activities

108330,329845,BKNG,Builders FirstSource  BLDR  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Shares of Builders FirstSource  BLDR  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 4 2  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  21 06 in the previous session  Builders FirstSource has gained 90 6  since the start of the year compared to the 16 9  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 28 6  return for the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 1  2019  Builders FirstSource reported EPS of  0 63 versus consensus estimate of  0 48 
For the current fiscal year  Builders FirstSource is expected to post earnings of  1 85 per share on  7 14 billion in revenues  This represents a  2 63  change in EPS on a  7 61  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 97 per share on  7 46 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 39  and 4 53   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Builders FirstSource may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Builders FirstSource has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 7 4X versus its peer group s average of 8 2X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Builders FirstSource currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Builders FirstSource meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Builders FirstSource shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Builders FirstSource Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Builders FirstSource have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including BMC Stock Holdings  BMCH   Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW   and Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices

108333,329848,BKNG,Regulators Get Down To The GRAM After Strangled Libra,opinion,"With zero price dynamic over recent days  Bitcoin causes unpleasant Deja Vu among market participants  A steady decline below  8K may become an obscene event for the market  as it potentially opens the way to new local lows and near the lower boundary  7K  Earlier investors bought back Bitcoin right after such downturns  considering their possibility to enter the market  at a discount   then as the rate decreases  the opinion about the asset changes  At some point  the market starts to believe in the trend change and the end of the bullish phase  and then Bitcoin becomes too expensive to buy 





Altcoins also obviously do not see any road maps  No one else promises a breakthrough and a  Brave new world   references to  1984  are more common  judging by how strong the governments  desire to get rid of even hypothetical competitors in the form of Libra and GRAM  Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies appear to be considered as  unavoidable evil  by the authorities  but they see no threat in these projects  They don t see it yet  It s about the trade volumes  if we are talking about several fake billions of dollars  no one will waste the time of regulators 
We can say the same about Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Libra Association has lost another major participant   Booking  NASDAQ BKNG   As escape velocity begins  more and more notable brands may also announce their disbelief in the project  It is not yet clear how much the company s desire to promote its digital currency is  There are a vast number of smaller companies that want to take the risk of entering the project  but Facebook itself has something to lose  If the company management decides to wind down the work  it may have a rather versatile impact on the market 
On the one hand  abandoning Libra will draw a line under all such projects  If the most prominent player is  strangled   others won t try  On the other hand  there is no absorption of the crypto market by large corporations  which is also very feared by crypto enthusiasts  So  Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies  invented on a wave of frustration in the banking system  may get a reason for living opposition to the traditional financial market  Satoshi s idea proved to be true  only decentralization and absence of leadership can keep the project alive  
Telegram s Blockchain can face a Libra like fate  As Telegram company started distributing the long awaited tokens  the SEC announced that token sale was not registered  and the tokens were declared as securities  The regulator managed to obtain a temporary court ban on the distribution of tokens among American investors  who invested almost half a billion dollars in the project  GRAM will be  strangled  as actively as Libra  The regulators  lightning fast reaction  consistency of the work of the courts and officials  testifies to the strong political will  It turns out that the Bitcoin maximalists were right  Ethereum may replace the FB and Telegram if its volumes are  too high  for politicians to keep a distance 
At the moment there is a very unpleasant combination of events on the crypto market  It turned out that the excitement around the p2p of the Binance platform turned out to be fake  A screenshot appeared on the network indicated the prospect of integration of AliPay and WeChat  which could potentially increase turnover  However  representatives of AliPay and WeChat reacted strongly to the fake buttons in the application  saying that they would never go for such integration 
The official Chinese position remains very tough and in line with the US position

108334,329849,BKNG,Tech Data  TECD  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Shares of Tech Data  TECD  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 7 1  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  112 5 in the previous session  Tech Data has gained 36 1  since the start of the year compared to the 20 2  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 33 7  return for the Zacks Retail   Computer Hardware industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 29  2019  Tech Data reported EPS of  2 69 versus consensus estimate of  2 33 
For the current fiscal year  Tech Data is expected to post earnings of  12 46 per share on  37 36 billion in revenues  This represents a 9 49  change in EPS on a 0 33  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  12 98 per share on  38 18 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 4 19  and 2 2   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Tech Data may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Tech Data has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are D and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 8 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 6 5X versus its peer group s average of 9 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 3  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Tech Data currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Tech Data meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Tech Data shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Tech Data Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Tech Data have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Burlington Stores  BURL   Stamps com  STMP   and Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 9  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Tech Data  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tech-data-tecd-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200473962,200473962

Almost all of the data was positive with perhaps the exception of the jobless rate that remained steady at 4 9   compared to expectations for a drop to 4 8   However  part of the explanation for the higher jobless rate would be due to the increase in the participation rate

Cash Flow Growth

While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17 1  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Booking Holdings  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month

108369,329884,BKNG,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Booking Holdings  BKNG ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online booking service is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Booking Holdings is 16 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 10 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 9  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Booking Holdings is 14 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17 1  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Booking Holdings  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Booking Holdings has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Booking Holdings is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-booking-holdings-bkng-200469873,200469873
108370,329885,BKNG,Late day buying could be start of turnaround,news,"By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK  Reuters    As U S  stocks continue to struggle in 2016  equities are showing some signs selling pressure may be reaching an end   The S P 500  SPX  is down about 13 percent from its record high in May  as oil remains mired below  30 a barrel  while concerns about stability among banks and uncertainty about the U S  Federal Reserve s path of rate hikes have pushed investors away from risk assets   But recent trading action on an intraday basis suggests investors may be starting to warm up to stocks again  In three of the last four losing sessions  late day buying took over in a pattern that had begun to emerge at the end of January   Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago  views that as a positive sign  He pointed out in a recent note to clients that the so called Smart Money Index  which compares trading action at the beginning and end of day trading  appears to have bottomed on January 12   The rationale behind the index is that professionals tend to dominate activity later in the trading session  and buying in the latter stages is a positive signal    My suspicion is that you are seeing institutions nibble at extremely compressed valuations   said Peter Kenny  equity market strategist at Kenny   Co LLC in Denver    The bottom line is  if you are ending the session with a positive trend  that tends to give the impression that there are buyers out there   However  while late day buying may be a good sign  it also could be preventing selling pressure from being exhausted   the so called  capitulation  that some market watchers are waiting for before they race in to buy  Even Ablin  who sees the bright side  says shares have to fall another five to ten percent before they are fairly valued  Another contrarian indicator released this week that could bode well for stocks is the AAII investor sentiment survey  which showed 48 7 percent of investors were bearish  near a three year high   Bill Stone  chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia noted the severely bearish sentiment and said in a note to clients   while this might seem counter intuitive  high amounts of negative sentiment versus positive sentiment often are a prelude to a move higher in stocks    Earnings also will remain in play next week  with names such as Priceline com  O PCLN  and Wal Mart  N WMT  providing insight into the health of the consumer after a positive retail sales report on Friday  Investors will also get data next week on regional manufacturing in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions  which has been weak  as well as inflation data and the minutes from the most recent Fed meeting

Investors will be focusing on minutes of the Federal Reserve s January policy meeting due on Wednesday at 19 00GMT  or 2 00PM ET  for fresh indications on whether the U S  central bank will raise interest rates at all this year 
The Fed left interest rates unchanged following its meeting on January 27 and said it was  closely monitoring  global economic and financial developments 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week that financial conditions have become less supportive to growth as foreign developments pose risks to the economic outlook  but also maintained that moderate growth at home would justify  gradual adjustments  to the Fed s monetary policy stance 
Aside from the minutes  the U S  will release data on producer prices  housing starts and building permits at 13 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET  followed by a report on industrial production at 14 15GMT  or 9 15AM ET 
Meanwhile  oil prices rose 2  in volatile trade as OPEC members travel to Tehran in an attempt to convince Iran to join an oil production freeze deal 
Qatar s Energy Minister and current OPEC President Mohammed al Sada  along with Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino and Iraqi Oil Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi  traveled to Tehran for talks with their Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh in a bid to reach a deal to restrain output and prop up sagging prices 
Top oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia on Tuesday agreed to freeze oil production at January levels  provided other oil exporters joined in  but stopped short of agreeing cuts in oil output 
Iran signaled that it would take a tough line in talks among oil producers on a production freeze  saying it would continue increasing its output until it reached levels seen before international sanctions were imposed

Industrial production in the U S  fueled investor appetite after registering its first increase in six months in January  boosting optimism over the health of the economy  official data showed on Wednesday 
At the same time  the rise in manufacturing production for the same period also beat consensus 
On the downside  the US housing market showed weakness in the first month of the year as both building permits and housing starts declined more than expected 
Meanwhile  producer price inflation  PPI  in the U S  unexpectedly increased  while core PPI also rose more than estimated  according to data from the Commerce Department 
The price increase could add credence to the belief that the Fed will hike interest rates twice this year  according to a Reuters poll of economists published on Tuesday 
Along similar lines  Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari hinted that next increase in the price of money could come in March  though he stressed that any decision would be data dependent 
In this sense  Investors will be focusing on minutes of the Federal Reserve s January policy meeting due on Wednesday at 19 00GMT  or 2 00PM ET  for fresh indications on whether the U S  central bank will raise interest rates at all this year

Further  the company s recent acquisition of Mellanox is likely to be its main driver as it will fortify its datacenter footprint and lend a competitive edge  However  the current pause in spending by hyperscale customers persists as an overhang on its data center business  Growing competition from AMD also poses a threat to the company

108402,329917,BKNG,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Booking Holdings  BKNG  Now,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online booking service a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Booking Holdings is 16 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 9 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Booking Holdings is 14 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17 1  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Booking Holdings have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Booking Holdings has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Booking Holdings is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-booking-holdings-bkng-now-200457723,200457723
108403,329918,BKNG,BKNG Vs  MONOY  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Internet   Commerce stocks have likely encountered both Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  and MONOTARO  MONOY   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Booking Holdings and MONOTARO are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BKNG has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
BKNG currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 85  while MONOY has a forward P E of 56 76  We also note that BKNG has a PEG ratio of 1 41  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MONOY currently has a PEG ratio of 2 64 
Another notable valuation metric for BKNG is its P B ratio of 15 64  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  MONOY has a P B of 22 
Based on these metrics and many more  BKNG holds a Value grade of B  while MONOY has a Value grade of D 
BKNG has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MONOY  so it seems like value investors will conclude that BKNG is the superior option right now ",2019-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bkng-vs-monoy-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200458923,200458923

108407,329922,BKNG,Top 5 Things to Know Today,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know this morning  Monday  November 9 
1  OECD cuts global growth forecast
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cut its global economic growth forecast to 2 9  in 2015 and 3 3  in 2016  down from the 3 0  and 3 6  predicted in September 
 Global growth prospects have clouded this year   the Paris based organization said in its semi annual report published Monday   The outlook for emerging market economies is a key source of global uncertainty at present  
2  U S  dollar pulls back but holds near 7 month peak
The dollar pulled back on Monday but held near seven month highs against the other major currencies as data showing the U S  economy created more jobs than expected in October bolstered expectations for a rate hike next month 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  slid 0 2  to 99 09  off Friday s highs of 99 29  the highest level since mid April 
3  China trade data disappoints
Data released Sunday revealed that Chinese exports slumped 6 9  from a year earlier in October  worse than forecasts for a decline of 3 0   while imports plunged 18 8   compared to expectations for a drop of 16 0  
That left China with a record high trade surplus of  61 6 billion last month  up from  60 3 billion in September 
The disappointing data reinforced the view that the economy remains in the midst of a gradual slowdown which will require policymakers in Beijing to roll out more measures to boost growth in coming months 
4  Global stocks mixed with China  Fed in focus
Shares in Japan and China kicked off the week with strong gains  lifted by a weaker yen and ongoing hopes for more stimulus 
In Europe  equity markets started the week in the red as downbeat trade data from China dampened the mood 
Meanwhile  U S  stock futures were down 0 3   suggesting a weaker opening on Wall Street later in the day 
5  U S  earnings season begins to wind down
Dean Foods  N DF   Priceline Group  O PCLN    DISH Network  Corporation  O DISH    Hertz Global Holdings   N HTZ  and Sotheby s  N BID  will report earnings ahead of the opening bell ",2015-11-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-today-370342,370342
108408,329923,BKNG,3Q Earnings Season  Retailers In Spotlight This Week,news,"By   
  title    Reuters Mike Blake  A Nordstrom department store at a shopping center in San Diego  The Seattle based upscale chain will report its earnings after markets close on Thursday as the third quarter earnings season pivots to large U S  retailers   rel  external image  
As we enter the fifth week of the third quarter corporate earnings season  big American companies haven   t fared as poorly as some feared  As of Monday  nearly 90 percent of S S P 500orporations have posted their June to September results and  as expected  profits and revenue are declining for the first time since the recession 
But the numbers are turning out to be better than expected  When the third quarter earnings season began early last month  most economists expected an overall U S  corporate earnings drop of 5 to  6 percent from  the  same period last year  Instead  the slowdown in growth stands at 1 29 percent  according to S P Capital IQ 
Energy and raw materials have been battered by a global China led slowdown and an oil supply glut  while a strong U S  dollar squeezes company earnings overseas  These factors have more than offset gains in the healthcare  tech and consumer discretionary sectors 
Dan Farley   regional investment director at U S  Bank  said investors should be cautious about growth expectations moving forward 
   We think the holiday season could be shaping up to being pretty decent considering the recent jobs report  but what s  more relevant than that is looking forward to 2016     Farley said     We see some pretty large growth expectations for next year  at 8    to 9 percent earnings growth  We think it will probably be more like 6 percent    

Friday   s robust U S  jobs report has set the stage for a possible U S  interest rate liftoff starting in December  which would begin to raise the cost of borrowing for the first time in nine years  which would in turn dig into corporate earnings in 2016 
Earnings season is shifting to big U S  retailers this week  including high end merchandiser Nordstrom and its more mainstream rival Macy   s  Here are some of the forecasts for companies reporting earnings this week based on economists polled by Thomson Reuters 
Monday
Dish Network Corp  NASDAQ DISH reports earnings on Monday before markets open in New York  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Colorado based satellite television provider to report lower revenue in the July September quarter compared to the same quarter last year  to  3 79 billion from  3 68 billion  But net income is expected to rise to  190 1 million  or 41 cents per share  from  146 0 million  or 31 cents per share  The company   s shares are priced at around  64 and they   ve lost nearly 13 percent of their value this year 
 Hertz Global Holdings  Inc  NYSE HTZ reports earnings on Monday before markets open  The Florida based car rental business is expected to report lower earnings in the July September quarter  to  3 07 billion from  3 12 billion in Q3 2014  But the owner of the Hertz  Dollar  Thrifty and Firefly brands is expected to more than double its net income  to  335 9 million  or 73 cents per share  from  149 0 million  or 32 cents per share  The company has been on an aggressive  200 million cost cutting plan and was forced earlier this year to correct accounting issues dating back to 2011  Hertz is trading at around  19 a share  which is down about 25 percent since the start of the year 
Priceline Group Inc  NASDAQ PCLN reports earnings on Monday before markets open  The Connecticut based online travel booking services provider is forecast to report  3 05 billion in revenue for the July September quarter  up from  2 84 billion in the same period the previous year  Net income is expected to be  1 14 billion  or  21 99 per share  from  1 06 billion or  20 03 per share  The company   s stock is trading at around  1 449 per share and the price is up 27 percent for the year

108427,329942,BKNG,5 Must Buy Stocks This Week On Q2 Earnings Despite Volatility,opinion,Wall Street witnessed severe volatility last week  ended Aug 2  following a less than expected dovish stance taken by the Fed and President Donald Trump s tweet expressing desire to impose 10  tariff on a new set of  300 billion Chinses goods effective Sep 1  Trump further said that the tariff rate could go up to 25  later if required  These two factors brought an end to the fabulous bull run  which started in early June  Consequently  all three major stock indexes      the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite      plunged 2 6   3 1  and 3 2   respectively  for the week  While both the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite witnessed their biggest weekly decline since Dec 21  2018  the Dow saw the biggest weekly decline since May 31 as well as its second biggest weekly decline for the year so far However  second quarter 2019 earnings results have so far come in better than expected  At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP  Strong earnings results will likely ensure a northbound move of stock prices of these companies in the near term despite market volatility Trade and Fed Let Wall Street DownAs a result of more than a year long trade war  the United Sates has already levied 25  tariff on  250 billion Chinese exports while China has reciprocated with 25  tariff on  110 billion U S  goods  So far  the U S  government has imposed tariff on intermediary goods to be used by U S  corporates to develop high tech products President Trump posted his tweet on Aug 1  just a day after Fed reduced the benchmark leading rate by 25 basis points to the range of 2 2 25   Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that this rate cut is to  insure against downside risks   and there was no signal that this is the start of a lengthy rate cut cycle  This comment significantly dented market participants hope looking for one or two more cuts Meanwhile  the U S  government sources revealed that 68  of the new Chinese goods  which will face the latest tariffs  will be either on consumer goods or auto parts  This is likely to severely dent consumer confidence besides gradually deteriorating business confidence  Several economists believe that the central bank may need to cut rate one or two more times after Trump s tweet

108460,329975,BKNG,EBAY Vs  BKNG  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Internet   Commerce stocks have likely encountered both eBay  EBAY  and Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  eBay is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Booking Holdings has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EBAY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
EBAY currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 88  while BKNG has a forward P E of 19 10  We also note that EBAY has a PEG ratio of 1 57  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  BKNG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 58 
Another notable valuation metric for EBAY is its P B ratio of 8 34  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  BKNG has a P B of 12 31 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EBAY s Value grade of A and BKNG s Value grade of C 
EBAY sticks out from BKNG in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that EBAY is the better option right now ",2019-07-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-vs-bkng-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200445634,200445634

108479,329994,BKNG,Booking Holdings  BKNG  Misses Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  came out with quarterly earnings of  11 17 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 26 per share  This compares to earnings of  12 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  0 80   A quarter ago  it was expected that this online booking service would post earnings of  19 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  22 49  delivering a surprise of 15 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Booking Holdings  which belongs to the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry  posted revenues of  2 84 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 21   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 93 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Booking Holdings shares have added about 1 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 14 9  
What s Next for Booking Holdings 
While Booking Holdings has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Booking Holdings was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

DS   as the Bull of the Day  Farmer Brothers Company   NASDAQ FARM   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Booking Holdings   NASDAQ BKNG    Google   NASDAQ GOOGL   and Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Drive Shack is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is in the spotlight as the weather starts to improve   The idea is that this driving range is the competitor to Top Golf  and if Calloway s  ELY  earnings tell us anything  it is that this concept works   Today  Drive Shack is the Bull of the Day DescriptionDrive Shack Inc is the owner and operator of golf related leisure and entertainment businesses  The services offered by the company comprise Drive Shack which is engaged in developing innovative golf entertainment venues  American Golf and Real Asset related assets Earnings HistoryAs I look at the Zacks website and the detailed estimates page  I see that there have been 2 misses in a row and that was preceded by a beat   Earnings are coming again soon  but my calendar said that it should have happened on Friday   Just something to be aware of Estimate RevisionsSo there isn t a whole lot of movement here  but what I do see is a reduction of the loss of 2019 moving from 40 cents to 28 cents over the last 60 days   That is enough to get this stock to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Tiger And Better WeatherTiger Woods won the Masters a few weeks back and that has been the driving force behind a lot more golfers hitting the links again   At least some of those golfer are serious about it and they will hit the driving range first  and the more interactive the better The weather was bad in many parts of the country following the Masters  but that seems to be over as we head into summer   Just going to any driving range will not translate into revenue for DS  but as we see Top Golf continue to do well  it stands to reason that this property should follow along  Farmer Brothers Company is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it has F s for the Value and Growth Style Scores   That alone should give you pause  but now  this stock is the bear of the day  Let s take a look at why this stock fell to the lowest Zacks Rank DescriptionFarmer Bros  Co  is in the business of roasting  packaging and distributing coffee and allied products to restaurants  hotels  hospitals  convenience stores and fast food outlets  The company s primary raw material is green coffee  Green coffee is purchased through domestic commodity brokers  Coffee is an agricultural commodity  and is subject to fluctuations of both price and supply Recent EarningsFARM recently reported earnings and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate   I see a loss of 27 cents for the quarter when a gain of 9 cents was expected  That is a huge miss and good for a negative 400  earnings surprise Estimate RevisionsThat recent loss was just the tip of the iceberg  as analysts not only cut the full year number  but also reduced expectations for next quarter to be another money losing quarter Booking com Rallies Amid Negative GrowthBooking Holdings released earnings after market close yesterday evening and missed on both revenue and earnings  The stock proceeds to rally over 4  in morning trading  even as the broader market breaks down  The firm showed year over year decreases in both sales and EPS The rationalization for why BKNG is rallying in the midst of earnings misses and negative growth lies with its accounting methodology  Revenues aren t recognized when reservations are made  they are accounted for when the reservation comes to fruition  Expenses  on the other hand  are recognized immediately when they are accrued  Q1 is when Booking Holdings receives the most reservations because individuals are planning their vacations for the year  but the majority of these reservations won t be executed until Q3  meanings revenue won t be recognized until then   Expenses associated with these revenues are immediately recognized  as I mentioned  This pushes earnings way down for Q1  making it the worst quarter for the firm annually  Having a worse than expected first quarter isn t necessarily a bad sign for BKNG  it could mean the firm is anticipating a big year Booking Holdings analysts would assess the balance sheet line item   deferred merchant booking   to determine the cash that has been received for reservations but not recognized as revenue yet  This line item is reporting roughly  1 8 billion in locked in revenue yet to be recognized this year  up almost  800 million from the previous quarter  This is illustrating a significant amount of future revenue that the income statement will disclose throughout the year Booking Holdings StoryBooking Holdings  previously known as The Priceline Group  went public in the wake of the  dot com  bubble immediately prior to the burst  The stock lost 98 5  of its value from April of 1999 through the end of 2000  Since then Booking Holdings has established themselves as an industry leader  with the stock rallying from less than  10 in 2000 to over  1800 that we see today  almost 12 000  gain  They have revolutionized the way people look for hotels taking advantage of Google s advertising platforms more effectively than competitors like Expedia   turning lookers into bookers   They spend a significantly higher percentage of their revenue on marketing and advertising than top competitor Expedia  which materializes on their bottom line Booking Holdings acquired European online booking site ActiveHotel com in 2005 for just  133 million  This deal was called  the best acquisition in internet history  by social media because no other acquisition in this field had been profitable  turning a company that lost millions a year to one that makes billions in less than 10 years This firm went from a second rate travel booking site to best in class in a short period of time Booking holding owns an extensive portfolio of online booking sites and apps with services ranging from travel reservations to catering reservations  Its current holdings include Booking com  KAYAK  Priceline  Agoda  Rentalcars com  and OpenTable Media

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Amgen  AMGN   Altria  MO  and Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Amgen s shares have lost  2 4  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry s decline of  16 5   Amgen beat expectations for earnings while sales were in line with estimates in the first quarter  
The Zacks analyst thinks that while Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Blincyto  Kyprolis   will drive sales  biosimilar and brand competition for its legacy products will create pressure on sales in 2019  Meanwhile  the uptake of key drug Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions  However  recently launched products including Aimovig  biosimilars and international expansion provide incremental growth opportunities  
Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and the approval of Evenity was a boost  In the past five years  Amgen has launched nine products  including two in new therapeutic areas  The company boasts a strong biosimilars pipeline  which could be an important long term growth driver for the company  Amgen s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient 
 You can   
Shares of Altria have gained  6 1  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Tobacco industry  which has increased  4 1  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is steadily gaining from the popularity of Smokeless products  During first quarter 2019  revenues in the category improved nearly 2 9   
To further bolster this unit  the company has made investments in JUUL and Cronos  Pricing also continues to drive the company s revenues  It has also undertaken cost reduction initiatives  Altria plans to deliver annualized cost savings of nearly  575 million by the end of 2019  Management expects such savings to mitigate the interest burden  stemming from debt issued to fund investments  
Further  we note that Altria grapples with persistently declining cigarette shipment volumes  Stern FDA regulations  along with increased health consciousness  are taking a toll on cigarette sales  Going forward  management expects cigarette industry volume to decline in the range of 4 5  
 You can   
Booking Holdings  shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet Commerce industry over the past year  losing  11 7  vs   3 6   Booking Holdings reported weak first quarter results wherein both earnings and revenues missed the estimates  
However  the company s total bookings continued to accelerate during the reported quarter  thanks to its rapidly growing Merchant bookings  Robust portfolio of properties remained a major positive which drove growth in room nights booked number of the company  Also  its strong direct channel  rising mobile share and growing alternative accommodation business contributed well  
The Zacks analyst thinks its strong focus toward enhancing offerings of places to stay to customers will aid growth in the near term as well as the long haul  Moreover  its growing branding initiatives remain tailwinds  However  currency headwinds and increasing advertising spend remain overhangs  Sluggishness in the rental car days and airline tickets unit poses a risk

The Zacks analyst thinks that while Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Blincyto  Kyprolis   will drive sales  biosimilar and brand competition for its legacy products will create pressure on sales in 2019  Meanwhile  the uptake of key drug Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions  However  recently launched products including Aimovig  biosimilars and international expansion provide incremental growth opportunities Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and the approval of Evenity was a boost  In the past five years  Amgen has launched nine products  including two in new therapeutic areas  The company boasts a strong biosimilars pipeline  which could be an important long term growth driver for the company  Amgen s restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost

108520,330035,BKNG,Earnings Preview  Booking Holdings  BKNG  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Booking Holdings  NASDAQ BKNG  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This online booking service is expected to post quarterly earnings of  11 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 93 billion  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 32  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Booking Holdings 
For Booking Holdings  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Booking Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Booking Holdings would post earnings of  19 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  22 49  delivering a surprise of  15 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Booking Holdings doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-booking-holdings-bkng-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200413984,200413984

108607,330122,BKNG,Book Your Next Vacation With These Travel Websites ,opinion,"Whether you re travelling for a meeting or going on vacation  you re bound to end up on one or two or maybe even all of the travel sites out there  to ensure you have the best trip ever  Recently  Travel Advisor   NASDAQ TRIP   and Booking Holdings   NASDAQ BKNG   reported their Q3 results  Along with these two companies  Airbnb is also a front runner when it comes to all things travel  Let s take a closer look as to why these specific sites matter 
Travel Advisor 
Besides booking hotels or finding flights on Trip Advisor s website  customers can easily find things to do  restaurants and even vacation rentals on it as well  With ease and accessibility  customers are able to find what they want and not have it be a hassle  Although some reviews on Trip Advisor are unhelpful at times  there are a wide variety of opinions on any of the places  hotels and restaurants  Customers find this helpful  especially if it s all in one spot like how it is on Trip Advisor 
In Travel Advisors Q3 report  the company posted a 4  increase in revenue to  458 million  an increase of  19 million year over year  Posting better than expected earnings at 72 cents per share  the company failed to meet revenue expectations  However  it saw the most growth in its non hotel revenue by 20  to  153 million  After the company posted its results on Thursday  shares surged by almost 15   CFO Ernst Teunissen also stated that Q3 had a number of very positive developments and that they are on track to deliver strong profit growth in 2018  leading into 2019 
According to the   there are about 70 000 000 Trip Advisor members from all over the world  with at least 315 000 000 unique monthly users 
Booking Holdings
Booking Holdings operates in more than 220 countries through their six primary brands  Through these brands  Booking com  Priceline  Agoda  Kayak  Rentalcars com and OpenTable  customers are able to go directly to the site they want  specified towards they are looking for 
Dominating the online travel industry alongside Booking Holdings is a similar company  Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE    However  Booking Holdings has been doing slightly better than Expedia in terms of profitability  This was apparent in their Q3 report where they posted an 11  increase in revenue from the year prior  The company plans to focus more on making the right investments in the upcoming year across their different brands  people  systems and marketing  
Airbnb
What started as two former schoolmates putting out an air mattress in their living room to rent out to others so they could cover rent for their studio loft  turned in to a billion dollar business  Although a privately held company  since its launch in 2010  Airbnb has seen a significant increase in profit and revenue   According to   in 2017 Airbnb brought in  93 million in profit on  2 6 billion in revenue  The company expects to earn around  3 5 billion a year by 2020 and at the pace that the company is going at  it seems viable that they will be able to do so 
Airbnb currently has over 5 million listings worldwide  in 81 000 cities and over 191 countries  The company has grown to become a worldwide phenomenon  when it was something that started within the United States  Although quite different to Travel Advisor and Booking Holdings  Airbnb  being a PLC  holds just as much success as the other two companies  In a listing by Forbes  it was rated as the  1 travel website amongst others like HomeAway and Jetsetter 
Bottom Line 
It s no surprise that the first place you look when finding a destination or a hotel is a travel website  Travel Advisor  Booking Holdings and Airbnb have all successfully created a platform which is easy and accessible to its users  Hence  why they have increasing revenue and growth in users year round  It is apparent that these three travel website companies hold their reign in the online travel industry

revenues increased 6  Revenues at SabreSonic Passenger Reservation System remained flat year over year  The conclusion of its implementation at LATAM Airlines was offset by decline in SabreSonic services and other discrete professional services revenues Hospitality Solutions revenues grew 3 1  year over year to  69 9 million  driven by growth in SynXis software and services revenues  Growth

revenues at Airline Solutions to remain flat year over year against the previously expected decline  This is due to higher than expected renewal rates Travel Network revenues for the full year is expected to grow 9 5 10 5   up from the earlier guidance of 6 8  rise For the fourth quarter  management expects ASC 606 to negatively impact revenue growth by  7 million Hospitality Solutions

Revenues are expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter  as some expected deals are not likely to be closed in the quarter  However  being a low margin business  this will not impact the

108651,330166,BKNG,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Booking com  Expedia  TripAdvisor  Hilton Worldwide Holdings And Marriott International,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 12  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Hotels  Part 1  including Booking com   NASDAQ BKNG    Expedia Inc    NASDAQ EXPE    TripAdvisor   NASDAQ TRIP    Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc    NYSE HLT   and Marriott International  Inc    NASDAQ MAR   Industry  Hotels  Part 1Link  Stocks in the hotel industry are benefiting from growth in demand that supports increases in both occupancy and average daily rate  ADR   The momentum in the U S  hotel industry continues in 2018 after moderate growth in 2017  In first quarter 2018  the industry witnessed a better than expected rise in demand  with revenue per available room  RevPAR  increasing by 3 5  Consequently  stocks in the Hotels and Motels Industry have put on an impressive show in the past year  handily outperforming the broader market  as a reflection of this positive backdrop  The  has rallied 20 2   surpassing the S P 500 index s gain of 14 5  The industry looks attractive  owing to rise in occupancy rate and gain in commercial transient demand  Further  we note that rising employment  higher real income and increased household net worth reinforced consumer confidence and sentiment  This has resulted in a steady rise in business and leisure travel  and higher transaction volumes  which are likely to continue The unemployment rate declined from 3 9  in April to 3 8  in May  the lowest in 18 years  The U6 unemployment rate  which includes people forced into part time work and people sporadically looking for jobs  declined to 7 6   the lowest level witnessed since May 2001 Going forward  consumer and business spending are expected to keep the mood upbeat  suggesting that the U S  economy will remain on solid footing in 2018  In fact  the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow model forecasts healthy 4 8   annualized rate  GDP growth in second quarter 2018 Numbers Look ImpressiveA recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  shows that new supply is likely to rise 2  in 2018  up from 1 8  in 2017  This is likely to result in 0 3  increase in occupancy rates in 2018 to 66 3   Moreover  ADR and RevPAR are projected to climb 2 6  and 3   respectively this year  In 2019  the industry is likely to register ADR and RevPAR growth of 2 8  each Meanwhile  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  rose 1 6  in April 2018  In fact  in a year  the index has gained 12 7  Additionally  according to Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  U S  hotels continue to witness robust improvement across all metrics  However  the report revealed that occupancy rate will decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in 2019 due to rise in demand post hurricane in 2017  Despite this  the industry will continue to report record performance due to robust industry fundamental Decline in International Travel a ConcernFall in international travel in the recent times has been a major concern for the U S  lodging industry  Moreover  negative sentiment related to traveling to and from the United States  given Trump administration s stringent policies on immigration and tourism visas  is detrimental to hotels  If the U S  dollar gains strength  this may keep industry growth in check  given its impact on inbound international travel Additionally  higher costs and increased supply along with pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown are likely to be headwinds Meanwhile  hotel companies have been focusing on renovation  and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  steep costs incurred by leading hotel companies to do so are taking a toll on profits  High labor costs will continue to be a major concern for hoteliers  In fact  online travel agents like Booking com  Expedia Inc  and TripAdvisor are also limiting the pricing power of these brands Another major threat comes from home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc   which offer digital service  allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc  and Marriott International  Inc   Both companies currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Catalysts Driving GrowthThe hotel industry is particularly vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of economic conditions  So the present solid economic fundamentals are likely to spur consumer spending in the remainder of 2018  raising optimism for hotel companies  Moreover  hotel companies will be able to counter any economic volatility better  if they keep moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services Also  these companies must look for ways to sustain their growth as online private accommodation aggregators flood the marketplace with new inventory  In fact  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  was viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany

consideration  both are undervalued compared to the wider industry  which has an exorbitant P S ratio of 19 24  However  Ambev is the pricier of the two  since it has a P S ratio of 5 59  higher than AB InBev s reading of 2 74 Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by low margins  Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within an industry  since they are bound by the same business constraints With a net margin value of 14 11   AB InBev is lower than the industry average of 21 6   Meanwhile  Ambev  with net margin of 24 77   is better placed on this count compared to its rival and industry Debt to Equity RatioThe debt to equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity  In the context of the beer industry  it is an indicator of the company s long term sustainability Both AB InBev and Ambev have better leverage positions than the industry  which has a debt to equity ratio of 61 22   Coming back to the individual companies  debt to equity ratio of AB InBev and Ambev is 1 45  and 10 36   respectively  Clearly  with a low debt to equity ratio this round goes to AB InBev Asset Turnover RatioSince the alcohol industry is essentially characterized by low margins and high volumes  activity ratios are extremely important when determining the health of a company  All activity ratios are geared toward gauging a company s ability to convert various heads under its balance sheet into sales or cash  The asset turnover ratio examines the level of efficiency with which a company utilizes its assets to conduct sales With an asset turnover ratio of 0 57  Ambev is comfortably placed with respect to the broader industry  whose value for this metric stands at 0 53  In this context  AB InBev has an asset turnover ratio of 0 45  which places it at a disadvantage to both the industry and Ambev Quick Ratio Considered to be a conservative measure of liquidity  the quick ratio gauges as to how liquid the current position of a company is  In other words  it measures the extent to which liquid current assets can service current liabilities  The measure is conservative since it does not take into account current assets that are relatively less liquid such as inventory With a quick ratio of 0 66  Ambev is better placed than the broader industry  whose value for this metric stands at 0 63  AB InBev is poorly placed on this count since its quick ratio stands at 0 54 Earnings History and ESPWhile considering   there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks for the current quarter as both the alcohol giants having readings of 0  However  taking into account a more comprehensive earnings history  Ambev has delivered a negative surprise in only one of the four preceding quarters and has an average negative earnings surprise of 5   Meanwhile  AB In Bev is at disadvantage  as it has not only delivered negative earnings surprises in three out of the four prior quarters  but also has an average negative earnings surprise of 12 3  ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that AB InBev holds an edge over Ambev when considering valuation ratio and leverage position  But on all other counts Ambev has a clear edge  Not only does it have a relatively better price performance and good earnings history  it is better placed when considering net margin  debt to equity  asset turnover and quick ratios  In this context  Ambev clearly holds an edge over AB InBev ahead of earnings Today s Stocks from

108723,330238,BKNG,PCLN  EXPE  TRIP Disappointed  Buy These Hotel Stocks Instead,opinion,"Online travel booking companies Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN    Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   and TripAdvisor   NASDAQ TRIP   reported mixed results  but investors punished the shares regardless 
In Priceline s case  the company s reported revenue and earnings of  4 43 billion and  35 22 a share  represent double digit growth from the year ago quarter and are ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  While Priceline usually guides conservatively to come back and beat the lowered expectations  this time investors weren t willing to give it the benefit of the doubt   
Expedia on the other hand  reported revenue and earnings that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues still managed to grow from last year  What s worse  it lowered its EBITDA outlook for the year from 10 15  to a mid  to high single digit percentage rate 
TripAdvisor missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line while beating on the bottom line  Earnings were below the year ago level 
When all the major players in any market produce unsatisfactory earnings reports  there s very likely to be a common factor hitting them  In this case  it s the hotels themselves 
Hotels generally share their inventory with online travel companies to facilitate the distribution of room nights for a fee  But as they grew larger and started enjoying the benefits of scale  these OTAs charged higher and higher fees  such that smaller hotels couldn t afford it  while larger hotels had to part with a good amount of their profits 
Or at least that is what hotels are saying through the American Hotel   Lodging Association  The association is looking to lobby people in the new administration and those serving in the ITC  objecting to what they call the companies  monopolistic business 
Another gripe with hotels is the online travel agents  refusal to pay occupancy tax  thus forcing hotels to pay 
Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  is also eating their lunch  The leading search engine is gaining on all fronts  first through advertising fees that companies like Expedia and Priceline pay and second  through services like Book on Google that lead customers directly to the hotel s app or web portal 
The hotel  then  offers loyalty points and other incentives to encourage customers to come directly to them instead of through an online travel agent  A recent report from Skift estimates that Google s travel business is now worth a  100 billion  or more than Priceline 
OTAs can t afford to sit and wait until all the business is lost  So they are investing heavily in marketing  This  again  is hurting their profits 
If this is a depressing picture  it luckily isn t the only alternative for investors looking for travel exposure  And indeed  since hotels are pitted against OTAs in this battle  why not invest in hotels themselves  So here is a list of hotels that are worth investing in right now

index s total market capitalization  having already released their results Picture Thus FarPer the latest   total earnings of these companies are up 7 8  on a year over year basis  74 9  of the companies beat EPS estimates   Total revenues are up 6 5   65 7  of the companies beat top line estimates  The earnings performance of the same set of companies has been unimpressive compared with the previous quarter but in line with the four quarter average  Revenue growth is notably tracking higher Third quarter earnings of S P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 5 6  from the year ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 5 5   Notwithstanding the weak performance of the Finance sector  total earnings from the remaining index are expected to rise 11  while revenues are anticipated to grow 6 9  on a year over year basis Notably  earnings estimate revisions for the fourth quarter continue to be favorable On Nov 6  two Internet commerce stocks   The Priceline Group Inc    NASDAQ PCLN   and TripAdvisor  Inc    NASDAQ TRIP     are scheduled to announce their third quarter 2017 results  Let s have a close look at the factors that will impact their results Predictions for PricelineStrong agency revenues are expected to drive international results  Priceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular  This is reflected in the merchant agency split of revenues  which was 16 77  in the second quarter We expect agency revenues to grow both sequentially and year over year in the to be reported quarter  driven by strength across priceline com and booking com  While priceline com is expected to benefit from room night growth  booking com is likely to ride on vacation rental properties growth The Zacks Consensus Estimate for agency revenues is pegged at  3 5 billion  In the second quarter  agency revenues had increased 30 6  sequentially and 25 9  year over year We observe that Priceline shares have gained 30 1  year to date  underperforming the 58 7  rally of the  it belongs to Merchant revenues are also expected to grow both sequentially and year over year  driven by strength across agoda com and rentalcars com  While agoda com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets  rentalcars com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements The Zacks Consensus Estimate for agency revenues is pegged at  621 million  In the second quarter  merchant revenues were up 12 7  sequentially and 3 8  year over year The U S  Commerce Department estimates international travel to the United States to witness CAGR of 3 3  from 2016 to 2021  Inbound travel volumes from Mexico  China  Canada  India and South Korea will be the highest during this period  Visitor volume in 2017 is expected to be up 2 4  from 2016  Since it is a major international player  these trends play into Priceline s sweet spot and will have an impact on its quarterly performance Predictions for TripAdvisorIn the second quarter  TripAdvisor s average monthly unique visitors on the company s branded websites and applications were approximately 415 million  increasing 18  year over year  The number is expected to increase in the soon to be reported quarter driven by its rich content The company offers more than 465 million travel reviews and opinions  growing at more than 290 contributions per minute  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at  454 million TripAdvisor s Hotel segment revenues of  326 million increased 4  sequentially and 3   year over year in the second quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at  328 million  Average monthly unique hotel shoppers were 153 million in the last reported quarter  increasing 11  year over year  Click based and transaction revenues per hotel shopper decreased 2  year over year  We observe that TripAdvisor shares have lost 17 9  year to date  significantly underperforming the 58 7  rally of the  it belongs to Lately  the company has been making efforts to get travelers to book hotels directly on its website instead of just using it as a review site  These efforts will continue to boost the company s clicked based advertising and transaction revenues  expanding its top line growth in the third quarter TripAdvisor s non Hotel segment revenues of  98 million increased 69  sequentially and 31  from the year ago quarter  Growth will continue to accelerate  driven primarily by continued strength in attractions and restaurant businesses However  mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company s profits  Also  management has been spending huge amounts on acquisitions  Though these continued investments could boost the top line  it can have a negative impact on near term profitability What Our Model SaysPlease note that according to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or  3  Hold  has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or  5  Strong Sell  stocks are best avoided  especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP  You can

108756,330271,BKNG,Ecopetrol  Papa John s  Priceline  TripAdvisor And Weight Watchers Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 7  2017    highlights Ecopetrol   NYSE EC   as the Bull of the Day and Papa John s   NASDAQ PZZA   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN    TripAdvisor   NASDAQ TRIP   and Weight Watchers   NYSE WTW   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Ecopetrol  EC  is today s Bull of the Day and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in an industry which ranks in the Top 2  of our Zacks Industry Rank  but that s only part of the story  Ecopetrol S A  operates as an integrated oil company  It operates through three segments  Exploration and Production  Transport and Logistics  and Refining  Petrochemical and Biofuels  The company produces crude oil and gas  and engages in the extraction  collection  treatment  storage and pumping  or compression of hydrocarbons  It also transports and distributes hydrocarbons  derivatives  and products The main good being produced for Ecopetrol is crude oil  Crude has been very kind lately  breaking out from a downward trend channel in early September  pushing above the 50 day moving average and never looking back  Recently it butted up against resistance in the mid  50s but has since broken out to the upside  With crude at fresh highs and trouble brewing in Saudi Arabia  crude is off to the races You want to talk about a scary ride  just look at the tumble EC took from 2013 through 2015  The stock came all the way down from  60 single digits  That is enough to turn anybody green in the face  Note how the earnings estimates in the multi colored lines came down throughout those years  Something has changed here recently  Estimates have troughed and taken a turn to the upside  Not only are current year estimates on the rise but there is the promise of growth next year  That turnaround has been a major tailwind for the stock  Take one look at this  Dad bod  of mine and you ll see that I ve never shied away from a pizza  The Chicago pizza snob in me isn t the reason why I m making this stock my Bear of the Day  No  I m putting this one on the naughty list for a simple reason  analysts have been dropping their earnings estimates Today s Bear of the Day is Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Papa John s  Papa John s International  Inc  operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the Papa John s trademark in the United States and internationally  It operates through five segments  Domestic Company Owned Restaurants  North America Commissaries  North America Franchising  International Operations  and All Others  The company also operates dine in and delivery restaurants  As of December 25  2016  it operated 5 097 Papa John s restaurants  including 744 company owned and 4 353 franchised restaurants The company has been handed down a round of negative earnings estimate revisions  Over the last thirty days  two analysts have dropped their numbers for the current quarter  current year and next year  The bearish sentiment has had an impact on our Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of these periods  This quarter s number has dropped from 86 cents or 74 cents  while the current year acks Consensus Estimate has gone down from  2 85 to  2 77  The most dramatic impact is reflected in next year s consensus where the number has dipped 7 7  from  3 25 to  3  Investors have already felt the pain with the stock coming down from  90 in December to under  59 during Monday s trading session  Since topping out on December 21st  2016  shares have dipped 34 2  while the S P 500 has rallied 14 5   Meanwhile  forward valuations have been cratering  After trading over 30x forward 12 P E to start the year  PZZA now trades at a 20 72 multiple  There s still plenty of room to the downside as the S P 500 trades at about 18 7x right now Additional content Late Monday Q3 Earnings Reports  WTW  PCLN and TRIPTwo web based travel logistics service companies    Priceline and TripAdvisor    are both down in late trading following quarterly earnings results that disappointed  particularly on forward guidance  Priceline  the world s largest travel booker  brought in  35 22 per share on  4 43 billion in quarterly sales  both which beat the Zacks consensus of  34 31 per share and  4 31 billion  respectively  TripAdvisor beat on the bottom line by 2 cents to 36 cents per share on a big sales miss of  439 million  well beneath the  454 3 million expected Earnings guidance for both companies have taken the wind out of these stocks in the after market  Priceline by roughly 6 5  and TripAdvisor by 8   Priceline s room night booked for next quarter shows a high range of 13   beneath the 15  consensus  TripAdvisor hosts its earnings call tomorrowmorning  but traders are sending the stock lower largely on weak revenues in the quarter Weight Watchers again easily outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines  65 cents per share in the quarter amounted to a 35 4  positive surprise  and also swung to a gain year over year from the estimate of 48 cents per share  The trailing 4 quarters for WTW showed an earnings beat average of 34   Sales in the quarter of  324 million was better than the  316 million expected  Shares

108757,330272,BKNG,Priceline  PCLN  Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates  Stock Falls,opinion,The Priceline Group Inc    NASDAQ PCLN   reported better than expected third quarter 2017 earnings Non GAAP net earnings of  35 22 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 91 cents and were better than the guided range of  32 4  34 1 per share  Earnings increased over twofold sequentially and 18 6  year over year Revenues of  4 43 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  89 million and were up a whopping 46 6  sequentially and 20 1  year over year On a year over year basis  both agency and merchant business showed strong momentum  Room nights and Rental cars performed impressively  The only point of weakness was airline tickets  On the call  management stated that the company will continue to focus on investments in people  systems and marketing with a long term outlook Overall  we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market  Priceline s strong position in international markets  growth opportunities in the domestic market  good execution  prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position However  weaker average daily rates for accommodations  ADR   macro headwinds  increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax related litigation remain overhangs  Year to date  the stock has surged 16 5   significantly underperforming the  s gain of 61 5  Let s check out the numbers Revenues in DetailsPriceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular  This is reflected in the merchant agency split of revenues  which was 16 77  in the third quarter  previous quarter split was  15 79   Merchant revenues were up 37 4  sequentially and 10 3  year over year  Agency revenues increased 51 1  sequentially and 21 8  year over year Advertising   Other revenues were up 16 5  sequentially and 27 1  from last year  This is basically non inter company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable The Priceline Group Inc  Revenue  TTM    On a sequential basis  room nights volumes increased 4 3   However  rental car days decreased 8 9  and airline tickets were down 5 9   On a year over year basis  room nights were up 18 6   rental car days increased 5 5  while airline ticket volumes were down 11 8  Priceline s room night growth is attributable to its geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tends to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market  as well as growing competition from local and international players  The company saw average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs decline 1  year over year  Rentalcars com also did quite well but there was some softness in ticket volumes BookingsPriceline s overall bookings were up 4 6  sequentially and 17 9   16  in constant currency  year over year and were at the higher end of the guided range Merchant bookings were up 11 2  sequentially and 17 2  year over year  Agency bookings increased 3 6  sequentially and 18  from the year ago levels Margins and Net IncomePriceline reported pro forma gross margin of 98 7   up 106 basis points  bps  sequentially and 141 bps year over year Owing to the nature of its business and the mix of agency versus merchant revenues  management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter  Priceline s gross profit dollars were up 48 2  sequentially but up 21 9   19  in constant currency  from last year  It was also higher than the guidance  International gross profit grew 23   20  on a constant currency basis   U S  gross profit grew 11  from last year Priceline s adjusted operating income was up triple digit sequentially and 18 2  year over year to  2 1 billion  Operating margin of 48 4  was up 1749 bps sequentially but down 78 bps from the year ago quarter Priceline s GAAP net income was  1 7 billion or  34 43 a share  compared with  720 2 million  or  14 39 a share in the June quarter and  506 million  or  10 13 a share in the year ago quarter Balance SheetPriceline ended the quarter with cash and short term investments balance of  7 3 billion compared with  6 4 billion at the end of the second quarter  As of Sep 30  2017  Priceline generated  3 5 billion of cash from operations  It spent around  223 7 million on capex and  1 1 billion on share repurchases At quarter end  Priceline had  8 7 billion in long term debt  Net debt was  5 9 billion compared with net debt of  4 9 billion in the previous quarter GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of 2017  Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 8 13  and total gross bookings to increase 9 5 14 5  year over year  5 5 10 5  on a constant currency basis  Notably  this guidance indicates a slowdown in growth rates of room nights booked and total gross bookings as it is the lowest compared to the last five quarters  Investors seem to be worried about this overly conservative guidance as reflected in the 9 4  decline in stock price in afterhours trading Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 10 5 15 5   6  11  on a constant currency basis   with adjusted EBITDA in the range of  870 910 million Pro forma EPS is expected to come in the range of  13 4  14  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 6  GAAP EPS is expected in the range of  12 6  13 2 Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPriceline currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Adobe Systems Incorporated   NASDAQ ADBE    Fair Isaac Corporation   NYSE FICO   and Autohome Inc    NYSE ATHM    all sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Long term earnings growth rate for Adobe  Fair Isaac and Autohome is projected to be 17   10  and 18 8   respectively Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile

108786,330301,BKNG,Priceline  PCLN  Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates But Stock Falls,opinion,The Priceline Group Inc    NASDAQ PCLN   reported better than expected second quarter 2017 earnings Non GAAP net earnings of  15 14 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 89 cents and were better than management s guidance of  13 65 at the mid point  Revenues of  3 03 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22 million On a year over year basis  both agency and merchant business showed strong momentum  Room nights and Rental cars performed impressively  The only point of weakness was airline tickets At the call  management stated that the company s ongoing investments in people  technology  product and marketing are contributing significantly Overall  we remain positive about the secular growth trend in the online travel booking market  Priceline s strong position in international markets  growth opportunities in the domestic market  good execution  prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position However  weaker ADRs  macro headwinds  increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax related litigation remain overhangs  Year to date  the stock has surged 39 8   underperforming the  s gain of 49 3  Let s check out the numbers Revenues in DetailsPriceline s revenues were up 25  sequentially and 18 3  from the year ago quarter Priceline generates the bulk of its revenues from international markets where the agency model is more popular  This is reflected in the merchant agency split of revenues  which was 16 77  in the first quarter  previous quarter split was  18 74   The Priceline Group Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Merchant revenues were up 12 7  sequentially and 3 8  year over year  Agency revenues increased 30 6  sequentially and 25 9  year over year Advertising   Other revenues were up 1  sequentially and 4 9  from last year  This is basically non inter company revenues from Kayak and OpenTable On a sequential basis  room nights volumes decreased 2 2   rental car days increased 11 3  and airline tickets stayed flat  On a year over year basis  room nights were up 21   rental car days increased 11 7  while airline ticket volumes were down 8 7  Priceline s room night growth is attributable to its geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tends to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market  as well as growing competition from local and international players  The company saw average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs decline slightly year over year  Rentalcars com also did quite well but there was some softness in ticket volumes BookingsPriceline s overall bookings were up slightly sequentially and 16   19  in constant currency  year over year and were within the guided range Merchant bookings were up 11 9  sequentially and 14 3  year over year  Agency bookings decreased 1 1  sequentially but increased 16 8  from the year ago levels Margins and Net IncomePriceline reported pro forma gross margin of 97 6   up 112 basis points  bps  sequentially and 253 bps year over year Owing to the nature of its business and the mix of agency versus merchant revenues  management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter  Priceline s gross profit dollars were flat sequentially but up 21   24  in constant currency  from last year and higher than the guidance  International gross profit grew 24   26  on a constant currency basis   U S  gross profit grew 7  from last year Priceline s adjusted operating income was up 16 2  sequentially and 22 8  year over year to  935 4 million  Operating margin of 30 9  was up 615 bps sequentially and 9 bps from the year ago quarter Priceline s GAAP net income was  720 2 million or  14 39 a share  compared with  455 6 million  or  9 11 a share in the March quarter and  580 6 million  or  11 6 a share in the year ago quarter Balance SheetPriceline ended the quarter with cash and short term investments balance of 6 4 billion compared with  5 4 billion at the end of the first quarter  Priceline generated  1 6 billion of cash from operations  It spent around  147 3 million on capex and  555 3 million on share repurchases At quarter end  Priceline had  7 6 billion in long term debt with net debt being  5 billion compared with net debt of  4 9 billion in the previous quarter GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2017  Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 11 16  and total gross bookings to increase 11 16  year over year  9 14  on a constant currency basis  Notably  this guidance indicates a slowdown in growth rates of room nights booked and total gross bookings as it is the lowest compared to the last four quarters  Investors seem to be worried about this overly conservative guidance as reflected in the 6 7  depreciation in the stock price in afterhours trading Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 15 5 20 5   12 5 17 5  on a

108787,330302,BKNG,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  Amazon And Priceline,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 17  2017   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   With Q2 results from two thirds of the Retail sector companies out  total earnings for the sector are up only  0 1  on  6 4  higher revenues  with 76 9  beating EPS estimates and a very strong 84 6  beating revenue estimates  The Retail Sector s Mixed Q2 ShowingNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points      With Q2 results from two thirds of the Retail sector companies out at this stage  total earnings for the sector are up only  0 1  on  6 4  higher revenues  with 76 9  beating EPS estimates and a very strong 84 6  beating revenue estimates  This is a notably higher proportion of positive beats from the sector than has been the case historically      While the Retail sector has a sizable number of companies still to report Q2 results  the earnings season has come to an end for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with results from only 38 S P 500 index members still awaited at this stage  Total earnings for the 462 index members that have reported are up  10 7  from the same period last year on  5 8  higher revenues  with 74 5  beating EPS estimates and 68 3  beating revenue estimates      While growth is a bit on the lighter side relative to the preceding period for these 462 index members  the proportion of companies beating estimates  particularly revenue estimates  is notably tracking above other periods      For Q2 as a whole  combining the actual results with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings are expected to be up  10 2  from the same period last year on  5 4  higher revenues  This would be the second quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth performance for the S P 500 index      The Q2 growth is broad based and not concentrated in one or two sectors  The strongest growth is from the Energy  Transportation  Technology  Aerospace  Construction  Business Services  and Industrial Products sectors  Q2 earnings growth would fall to  8 5  on  4 8  higher revenues on an ex Energy basis       Beyond Q2  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to grow by  4  on  4 7  higher revenues in the September quarter and  8 7  on  5 6  higher revenues in Q4        Estimates for Q3 have come down  but they appear to be following the moderate revisions pace we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season  Estimates have fallen for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with the Technology and Industrial Products sectors experiencing positive revisions        For full year 2017  total earnings for the index are expected to be up  7 5  on  4 1  higher revenues  which would follow  0 8  earnings growth on  2 1  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 1  in 2018 and  8 9  in 2019 Retail Sector ScorecardThe official Standard   Poor s industry classification places the retail space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  but Zacks has a stand alone economic sector for the industry that enables us to have a more granular view of developments in this space  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar operators  the online vendors like Amazon NASDAQ   NASDAQ AMZN        Priceline NASDAQ   NASDAQ PCLN       and restaurant operators  Results from the online vendors and the restaurant operators are already behind us at this stage For the Q2 earnings season  we have now have results from 26 of the 40 retailers in the S P 500 index  Total earnings for the 26 retailers that have reported already are up  0 1  from the same period last year on  6 4  higher revenues  with 76 9  beating EPS estimates and 84 6  beating revenue estimates The proportion of retailers beating both EPS and revenue estimates is a very high 73 1   the second highest of all 16 Zacks sectors A big proportion of retailers are beating estimates  both EPS and revenue estimates  at rates that are significantly above what we have been seeing from the same group of 26 retailers  but the Q2 earnings growth rate represents a deceleration from the historical trend A big reason for the sector s weak earnings growth performance is Amazon s results  whose Q2 earnings were down  77  on a year over year basis even as revenues were up  24 8   Had it not been for the Amazon drag  total Q2 earnings for the Retail sector would be up  5 4   which would be an improvement over what we have been seeing from the ex Amazon group in other recent periods For the sector as a whole  combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still to come retailers  total earnings are on track to be modestly in negative territory   0 4   on  4 4  higher revenues About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity

One more reason I m retiring at the end of this week and month is my love of travel 
I m heading out for one last bike ride tomorrow for the rest of the week with an old friend I haven t seen in more than a decade so I ll knock out this letter and blog tonight  instead of the normal Tuesday  so I can enjoy my evening away and then I ll have one out on Thursday  for the final time 
We saw markets show a little weakness today along with the usual market leaders like Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB   Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  but you get the point 
That s why NASDAQ was down so much but many other stocks are holding up and continue to look great  so far 
I remain quite heavy into stocks but am being stopped out or locking in gains as my process unfolds  although I did buy some Eldorado Gold Corporation  NYSE EGO  today with gold taking the turn by the looks of it

108836,330351,BKNG,TripAdvisor Plunges To 52 Week Low  What s Pushing It Down ,opinion,"Shares of TripAdvisor  Inc    NASDAQ TRIP   hit a 52 week low of  36 10 on Jun 19 
The stock has declined 23 1  since its first quarter 2017 results on May 9 against the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry s gain of 4 6   Shares have lost a massive 43 8  over the last year in contrast to the industry s gain of 52 3  

Currently  TripAdvisor faces quite a few challenges  Let s check out the factors that have resulted in the new low 
Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Downgrade
Credit Suisse on Monday downgraded the company from  neutral  to  downgrade  slashing its price target from  40 to  34  The firm anticipates a 10  decline in TripAdvisor s EBITDA and a challenging third quarter based on higher 2018 television advertisement forecast 
Credit Suisse analysts pointed out TripAdvisor s higher valuation compared with its online travel industry peers such as Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN   and Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   despite disappointing earnings  weak growth and slow turnaround 
Disappointing Earnings
The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings and revenues in the first quarter  Revenue headwinds that originated from the 2016 instant booking roll out continue to impact the company s profitability 
TripAdvisor  Inc  Net Income  TTM 
   Rapid growth in mobile traffic has led to lower monetization benefits and huge investments and continue to impact TripAdvisor s financial results  Macro headwinds  increasing competition from Priceline  Expedia and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   and lack of visibility also remain overhangs 
The modest 5 7  year over year growth in revenues indicates a slow pace of transition from travel review to travel bookings  Last month  CFO Ernst Teunissen anticipated a decrease in click based and transaction revenues that forms a major part of the company s revenues  He expects it to fall to mid  to high single digits in the current quarter after coming in at 12  in the first quarter  These factors have been adversely impacting the company s share price 
Downward Estimate Revisions
For the full year  five estimates have moved down in the past 60 days  compared with two upward revisions  This has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from earnings of 81 cents a share 60 days ago to its current level of a loss of 78 cents 
Also  for the current quarter  TripAdvisor has seen six downward estimate revisions versus no upward revision  which dragged the consensus estimate down to 20 cents a share from 23 cents over the past 60 days    
To Conclude
Notwithstanding the challenges  the company has been making considerable progress with growth initiatives to boost hotel bookings  strong focus on developing mobile products  expansion into the international restaurant reservation space and improvement in user growth and engagement  especially related to mobile devices 
The company could turn the wheel in its favor by accelerating the pace of its transition

108866,330381,BKNG,Analysis And Earnings Trade Ideas For Priceline,opinion,"Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN  has been the darling of the on line travel industry over the past year  And why not  the stock is up over 40  since breaking out of a base in August last year  The chart below shows the price action since  There was a 3 month consolidation after the election in November that was followed by a 250 move higher  That led to another consolidation that the price broke out of at the end of April  A similar move to the upside would give a target to 2020 
Momentum indicators are running hot into the earnings report tonight  The RSI is in technically overbought territory and the MACD is at the March peak  But like in March  this can work itself out over time without a price pullback  or can just get more overbought  Both moves higher started with a jump off of tight 20 and 50 day SMA s  Notice that the Bollinger Bands  are opened to the upside  allowing it to rise 
There is support at 1880 and 1806 followed by 1795 and 1735  There is no resistance above the high at 1927  Short interest is moderate at 3 2   traders know not to short the Shat  The stock has moved about 7 42  after the last 6 reports  That would be about a  141 move at today s price  giving a range of 1765 to 2050  Wow  The weekly options chain is pricing in a smaller  80 move by Friday  with implied volatility elevated at 56  compared to the June options at 23   Open interest is largest at the 2000 strike on the Call side  with some size at 1975 as well  On the Put side the biggest open interest is at the 1800 strike with some size trading today at 1810  1830 and 1850 and 1877 5

Trade Idea 1  Buy the May 12 Expiry 1900 1850 1830 broken wing Put Spread for  16 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the May 12 Expiry 1910 1925 Call Spread   9  and sell the May 12 Expiry 1815 Puts for free 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the May 12 Expiry June 2000 Call Calendar   16  and sell the May 12 Expiry June 1850 Put Calendar   14 credit  for  2 
Trade Idea 4  Sell the May 12 Expiry 1800 2000 Strangle for  14 credit 
Trade  1 makes money on a close anywhere below 1884 Friday  Trade  2 gives some upside near the current price and protection down to 1815  near the breakout level  Trade  3 looks for any move higher to stall at 2000 this week and gives short term protection for downside below 1850 this week  Trade  4 is profitable on a close between 1786 and 2014 Friday  I like  1 and  2 the best

108892,330407,BKNG,Mettler Toledo  MTD  Q1 Earnings  Is A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Mettler Toledo International Inc    NYSE MTD   will report first quarter 2017 earnings on May 4 after the bell 
Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3 33    In fact  Mettler Toledo boasts a solid surprise history  having beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is a positive 3 4  
We also note that year to date  shares of Mettler Toledo outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  While the stock recorded growth of 23 4   the industry gained 19 6  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
The company has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an  of  0 33   a combination that increases the probability of a positive surprise  This is because  per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  to beat estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
We don t recommend Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement 
What Happened in the Fourth Quarter 
Mettler Toledo delivered strong fourth quarter 2016 results  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts 
Net revenue of  709 7 million was up 5 4  on a year over year basis  Non GAAP net income was  141 9 million compared with  130 6 million a year ago  The better than expected results were the result of strong market conditions and good execution 
Mettler Toledo International  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 
   
What We Are Looking at Ahead of ResultsMettler Toledo s strong global network of sales and service organizations offer significant revenue opportunities 
The company is focused on the development of advanced products and cost reductions by making prudent investments in research and development  
On the technological advancement front  the focus is on new or enhanced functionality  new applications  more accurate or reliable measurement  automation through robotics and additional software capability 
On the cost reduction front  the focus is on reduction of manufacturing cost through design and serviceability enhancements  We believe technology development and cost management will impact margins positively 
We remain positive about the company s Stern Drive program aimed at operational improvement through material cost reductions  shop floor productivity and back office productivity  We expect this program to complement existing Spinnaker and Blue Ocean programs and enhance supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies 
For the first quarter  Mettler Toledo expects local currency sales to grow approximately 8  Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 24  to 26  to  3 05 to  3 10 
Note that the company s business segments  especially the high end laboratory instruments business experiences seasonality  This segment experiences stronger demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter  relative to second and third quarters  The seasonality causes considerable fluctuations in revenues and profits and makes forecasting difficult 
Summing Up
Mettler Toledo s leading market position  focus on product development and cost reduction  sales and marketing efforts and the Blue Ocean program bode well  The company has a solid history of positive surprises and this quarter may not be different  Its positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  2 enhance the likelihood of a positive surprise

108918,330433,BKNG,5 Stocks To Watch  FOSL  CSCO  TRIP  MAR  DE,opinion,"Fossil Group  NASDAQ FOSL 
Consumer Discretionary   Textiles  Apparel   Luxury Goods   Reports February 14  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 22  one cent above the sell side consensus and 16  lower than the same period a year earlier  That estimate has decreased 4  since Fossil s last quarterly report  Revenue is anticipated to decrease 2  to  975 Million   5M below Wall Street 

What to Watch  Fossil has posted 5 consecutive quarters of negative growth and is about to make it 6  While the company s bet on smartwatches are expected to drive growth  that innovation has come at a price  and margins for those items are lower than traditional watches  The market for traditional watches and accessories remains challenging  however  which is why Fossil is hoping that diversifying into wearables will get them through the rough patch  Last quarter the company narrowed its 2016 outlook due to these factors 
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO 
Information Technology   Communications Equipment   Reports February 15  after the close 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 58  4 cents above the Wall Street consensus and up 2  from the same period last year  That estimate has decreased 5  since Cisco s most recent report in October  Revenue is anticipated to come in at  11 6B  2  lower than the year ago results  and  90M higher than the sell side s consensus 

What to Watch  Cisco has a history of beating analysts estimates and is looking to extend its streak tomorrow  Cisco s winning strategy includes expanding its product portfolio beyond switching and routing products to high growth markets such as cyber security and Internet of Things  Partnerships with Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  and Pure Storage  NYSE PSTG  along with the acquisitions of CloudLock will help secure greater market share and support top line growth  Unfortunately  Cisco still derives a large portion of revenue from networking switches and routers which continue to show limited growth and upside  As this continues to show weakness Cisco s other products will be relied on more heavily to carry performance  Analysts are expecting this quarter to worsen from previous quarters on the back of weakness in its legacy business  Additionally  increasing competition  weak IT spending  and currency headwinds should play a role in sluggish growth this upcoming quarter 
TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP 
Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog Retail   Reports February 15  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 31  1 cent above the Wall Street consensus  Revenue expectations of  326 6 million are roughly in line with the sell side consensus  Expectations have decreased 7  since last quarter  putting YoY growth expectations at  29  for EPS and 7  for sales 

What to watch  Stronger travel trends are emerging as evidenced by robust results from the airlines  and other travel booking sites such as Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  this earnings season  This should bode well for TRIP which has already seen shares rise 11  in 2017  The company has taken on several new initiatives recently  including the very successful Instant Booking  expansion into restaurant reservations and development of mobile offerings  TripAdvisor operates in a very competitive online travel agency market that is largely a two horse race between Expedia and Priceline  TRIP is beginning to close the gap though with the acquisition of CityMaps and a new more user friendly website  Expectations have still edged lower in the past 3 months with analysts calling for negative YoY earnings growth 
Marriott International  NASDAQ MAR 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports February 15  after the close 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 85  one cent above the Wall Street consensus  The Revenue expectation of  4 85 billion is  30M above sell side consensus  Expectations have decreased 4  since last quarter  putting YoY growth expectations at 10  for EPS and 30  for sales 

What to watch  Marriott is likely to benefit for the very same reasons as TRIP  Increasing travel demand along with continued expansion are expected to boost the quarter s results  While expected earnings of growth of 10  would be the lowest amount since Q1 2014  expected revenue growth of 30  would be the highest since MAR has IPO d in 1998  Its recent acquisition of Starwood Resorts makes Marriott the largest hotel operator in the world and provides a huge new layer of revenue 
Deere   Company  NYSE DE 
Industrials   Machinery   Reports February 17  before the open 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  0 62 on  4 925 billion in revenue  above Wall Street by 11 cents on the bottom line and  300M on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this reflects a 25  decrease in earnings and a 13  decrease on sales  Earnings estimates have increased 13  the last quarter  while revenues increased 5  

What to Watch  Deere and other machinery names have been seeing upgrades to their fundamentals in the wake of the nomination of President Trump and his promise to increase infrastructure spending in the US  Just this year  DE s stock is up 7 5   Deere has a great record of surprising to the upside  beating Wall Street estimates on EPS for the last 4 years  Investors are hoping they can do so again when they report on Friday ",2017-02-14,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-2-13---fosl,-csco,-trip,-mar,-de-200175680",200175680

108921,330436,BKNG,The Consumer Discretionary Sector Can Extend A Strong Q1 Into Q2,opinion,"Despite valuations that continue stretch above historical norms  the consumer discretionary sector rode an improved economic environment to become the second best performer in the first quarter 
The 8 4  return of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLY  easily bested the 5 9  return of the S P 500 and trailed on the technology sector s 10 7  return during the quarter  It was a strong performance from an area of the market that looks like it has the ingredients in place to continue its rally into the coming quarter 
Consumer discretionary stocks tend to do best in environments when people feel they have the money to buy things they don t necessarily need  It s characterized by growing personal incomes  low unemployment and high consumer confidence  According to the latest data  that s  for the most part  the type of economic backdrop we re experiencing right now 
The commonly used unemployment rate currently sits at 4 7   The U6 unemployment rate  which essentially counts anyone working less than full time as unemployed  is 9 2   a level similar to where the job market sat before the financial crisis  Those numbers in a vacuum suggest we re at full employment  Some will argue that the level of underemployment is too high or that labor force participation  which has been declining for the last 15 years  is still too low  but the overall picture painted by the BLS argues that the nation s job market is in good shape and most workers have good enough jobs to support increased consumer spending 
The other main factor supporting discretionary stocks  Consumer confidence is booming  The two most popular measures  from the University of Michigan and the Conference Board  both just hit levels not seen in roughly 15 years  The Conference Board s report also said that the percent of consumers stating that jobs are  plentiful  rose to over 31   a 16 year high  Consumer confidence is an opinion survey not necessarily backed by actual data but indicates the degree of optimism in the current economy  Consumers confident in their jobs and financial situation tend to be more willing to open up their wallets 
What could potentially derail the momentum of consumer discretionary companies  Wage growth is still relatively weak  At full employment  workers generally have the leverage to demand higher salaries  That hasn t really been the case in this recovery  While workers may have jobs  their real average weekly earnings growth  earnings growth adjusted for inflation  is flatlining  Consumers may be hesitant to increase spending without a corresponding rise in income  especially if inflation begins picking up 
The Fed  as usual  will play a large role in where the economy goes from here  The latest Dot Plot indicates that the Fed is anticipating further rate hikes in 2017  There s already some concern that if the Fed begins raising rates too quickly in a low wage growth environment  the economy could get pushed back into a recession 
The fund s solid first quarter was fueled by gains from top ten holdings Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   up 18   Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN   up 21   and Lowe s Companies Inc  NYSE LOW   up 16   The expense ratio is 0 14  
The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF is the biggest fund in the sector  Other options include the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary  NYSE VCR   the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary  NYSE FDIS  and the iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC  
The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLY  closed at  87 95 on Friday  up  0 01   0 01    Year to date  XLY has gained 8 05   versus a 5 46  rise in the benchmark S P 500 index during the same period

108922,330437,BKNG,TripAdvisor s New Strategy Brings New Opportunities,opinion,"Ever since Trip Advisor rolled out their Instant Booking platform to become a one stop shop for travel  their stocks have been suffering  Do we think it is all going downhill from here  Or do we think this is just a teething phase and its a good time to buy on the dip before it rebound  Let s take the  approach to find out 
1  Fundamental Points
Who the heck are they 
Needham  Massachusetts based TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP  is one of the first websites I visit whenever I think of a travel destination  They use their in depth travel related reviews to rate and rank popular travel destinations  hotels  and restaurants  Many travelers hold TripAdvisor s rankings in high regard  and base their travel decisions on what they read 
There is also a nifty online forum discussion page where you can ask questions about a travel destination such as  Which is the best restaurant to visit in the North Pole    or  Are there mosquitoes in Iceland    There is a strong community spirit on Trip Advisor where seasoned travelers help out other fellow travelers 
They recently seemed like they have moved away from their ad based model  and rolled out an instant booking service platform for booking hotels and flights directly on their website  making them a one stop shop for travel research  reviews  and bookings  Because of this move  they are putting themselves in direct competition with the online travel agencies  OTA  sector 
Who are their competitors 
The leaders of the OTA sectors are Washington based Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  and Connecticut based Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN   They are participating in TripAdvisor s Instant Booking platform  after much reluctance and hesitation   only because of TripAdvisor s wide customer reach  This participation allows for a win win relationship to develop  Talk about  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer   
Fun Fact  Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  owns Hotels com  Orbitz  Trivago  HomeAway  Egencia  Travelocity  Hotwire  Wotif Group  CarRentals com  and Traveldoo  Priceline Group owns bookings com  agoda com  KAYAK  RentalCars  and OpenTable 
With the rise of technology and social media brings about a new wave of competitors AirBNB  AirBNB is a community based online marketplace  They have been disrupting the scene of not only online travel agencies  but hotels as well  Many online travel agencies and hotels view AirBNB as a threat and have been pressuring governments to include more rules around their business model 
What are they doing differently TripAdvisor has built a strong online community over the years  They have almost 400 million monthly unique visitors and their user reviews doubled in 2016 to 465 million  They are unlike Expedia and Priceline  where users only go to their websites to make travel bookings  Although TripAdvisor has a much larger customer base than Expedia and Priceline  many of their users use TripAdvisor only for travel research  then moving on to Expedia or Priceline to make their bookings 
TripAdvisor s biggest hurdle is converting these travel researchers into actually making the booking on their website 
TripAdvisor has made this strategic investment into their company  We just have to wait it out to see it become a seamless one stop shop for travelers  When users do finally accept the transition and change  getting in now and holding the stock will reap tremendous benefits 
What s going on in their company structure 
TripAdvisor s CEO and co founder is 53 year old Stephen Kaufer  and he is committed to seeing Instant Booking s successful transition on TripAdvisor  He believes it is the right decision  and will see it through  His compensation in 2016 was  1 338 110 
There have been rumors through the great vine that TripAdvisor and Priceline may join forces 
This brings us to the second point of  for the TripAdvisor stock analysis  Technicals 
2  Technical Points  TripAdvisor Stock Analysis
TripAdvisor spun off from Expedia in December 2011 to go public  The stock peaked in spring 2014 at  110 per share but has been on the downhill since  There is a strong resistance level around the 50  Fibonacci retracement level at 67 62  It ranged between 60 70 in 2016  and plummeted down towards the end of last year while the global transition of Instant Booking was ongoing  It is currently being supported around the 78  Fibonacci zone at  41 64 

3  Market Sentiment
On the daily time frame  TripAdvisor appears to have formed a triple bottom around the 41 18 level  which is just below the 78  Fibonacci retracement  It seems like the TripAdvisor stock has bottomed out around there  If the price confirms or breaks above the neckline of the triple bottom  this could be our first indication of a reversal 

The stock price still remains below the  cloud  The Kijun line seems to be crossing above the Tenkan line as of now  If it does  it will be another confirmation of a bullish reversal

108941,330456,BKNG,Opening Bell  Election Day Is Finally Here,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Election Day is finally here  After Sunday night s FBI announcement that it wouldn t be pressing charges against Hillary Clinton  markets have mostly regained their confidence  although the possibility of a Brexit style shock remains 
World markets appear to be taking a wait and see approach  and were mostly unchanged overnight  The Nikkei dipped 0 03   to close at 17 171 38  the Shanghai Composite ticked up 0 44  to 3 147 08  and the Hang Seng closed at 22 913  up 0 49   
In Europe  the FTSE is currently up 0 09  to 6812 3  the DAX has moved up just 0 04  to 10 461  and the Stoxx 50 has gained 0 33   to 3 014  As US polls open  additional volatility might become a factor  as election results begin to trickle in 
With markets perceiving that Clinton s chances of a win have increased  the S P 500 gained yesterday  rising 2 22  to 2 131 52  the Dow climbed 2 08  to 18 259 60  and the NASDAQ gained 2 37  to close at 5 166 17  The S P 500  Dow  and NASDAQ are all 0 1 0 2  lower in premarket trading  The VIX is currently up 0 48   to 18 80 
Traders are expecting an approximately 2  stock price swing in either direction tomorrow  once results are publicized  Citigroup is estimating a 3 5  sell off in the event of a Trump victory 
Forex
The US Dollar Index is down 0 08  at 97 70  but the dollar has mostly steadied against the euro  pound  yen  and the Swiss franc  The Mexican peso is also up  since FX markets appear to believe that Trump s chances are slim 
Expect volatility at least until after the US election news is behind us  anticipate some temporary movement toward safe havens including the yen and the Swiss franc 
Commodities
Gold spiked higher last week during the FBI s re opened investigation  but the precious metal appears to have stabilized  Analysts believe a Clinton victory is now priced in and commodities markets have begun eyeing next year s   Of course  should Trump do well as the day progresses  gold will likely move higher 
Crude oil saw a slight bump up yesterday  following an earthquake near the Cushing storage facility in Oklahoma  but gains were capped by the rising dollar  It is currently trading up 0 40  at  45 08  Brent is also up  0 59  to  46 41  OPEC is now claiming that Russia is on board with a deal to limit oil production  but the news hasn t significantly swayed prices  perhaps traders are getting wise to the production freeze game 
Stocks
Most polls are now showing Clinton as the likely winner which is also the prevailing market sentiment heading into the election  And  since Wall Street has been a big supporter of Mrs  Clinton s campaign  equity markets are also largely optimistic 
Nevertheless  a Clinton victory  especially if the Democrats also take the House  would pose concerns for biotech  insurance  and healthcare stocks  The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  alone  after Clinton tweeted she would lay out a plan to take on  price gouging  in the specialty drug market  Since then  the Index has fallen 16  in total  to 2634 3  At the same time  the NASDAQ Health Care Index has lost around 14   and is currently down to 596 9 
Trump s vision of making America energy independent  creating millions of new jobs  and unleashing  50 trillion in untapped shale  oil  and natural gas reserves  would mean a potential resurgence for US oil and gas companies

In a   Alphabet Inc  s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google division announced that it will be updating its GFlights  or Google Flights  app to include notifications informing users when a current fare will expire  as well as how much money you can save by booking a flight before that expiration happens  Users can also keep watch on fare changes on flights or specific routes through email notifications 
GFlights offers tips on discovering the lowest price for a certain flight route  and even suggests alternate airports and travel dates  It lets you know about any expected price hikes based on historic prices as well  The update is set to be rolled out in the next few weeks  says Google 
Users can use GFlights for more than booking airfare  too  The app provides ways to scoop up deals on hotels by  label ing  deals when a hotel s price is lower than usual compared to historical pricing  or if there are discounts to the normal rate for those dates   the company said  GFlights also notifies users when savings are available to loyalty members on a hotel s website

108965,330480,BKNG,Priceline  PCLN  Q3 Earnings Preview  What s In The Cards ,opinion,The Priceline Group Inc    NASDAQ PCLN   is slated to report third quarter 2016 earnings on Nov 7 after the bell The company is one of two leading players in a highly fragmented online travel booking market  the other one being Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   But the two companies are different because Priceline generates most of its revenues overseas particularly Europe while Expedia is more focused on North America  Both companies are expanding geographically Priceline is focused on improving the travel booking experience  Booking com is now harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to increase personalization in phases   This is likely to have an impact on results  Another emerging trend is the alternative accommodations segment  where both Priceline and Expedia have been strengthening their presence  Privately held Airbnb is the frontrunner here  but the leading Open Travel Alliances  OTA  has a huge reach and can come up strongly from behind Let s take a quick look at how Priceline has been doing recently Factors to ConsiderLast Quarter Recap  In the second quarter  Priceline beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines Both agency and merchant businesses remained strong  with room nights growing much faster than in recent history  The rental cars business was also quite strong  The only point of persistent weakness was airline tickets Though management had expected currency impact to be neutral  it continued to put pressure on results since most of the business is generated overseas  But the company s revenues grew anyway and margins also went up sequentially Terrorist attacks had a negative impact on bookings and resulted in increased cancellations in affected areas but the total impact on Priceline was negligible Management said that Brexit and the devaluation of British currency will have a limited impact on Priceline as UK destination gross profit and UK source gross bookings were only around 10  of the business Third Quarter Expectations  For the third quarter  Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 18 23  and total gross bookings to grow 14 19  year over year  15 20  on a constant currency basis   This is expected to yield a year over year revenue increase of 12 17    3 55 billion at the mid point   below the  3 59 billion analysts were expecting Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 15 20   16 21  on a constant currency basis   with adjusted EBITDA in a range of  1 73  1 83 billion Pro forma earnings per share are expected to come in a range of  28 30  29 80  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  28 64  GAAP net income is expected to be  1 30 1 38 billion  or  26 10  27 60 a share Attractive IndustryThe U S  Commerce Department estimates international travel to the U S  to grow at a CAGR of 3 1  from 2015 to 2020  Visitor volume is expected to grow from 0 4  in 2015 to 2 6  this year  Inbound travel volumes from Mexico  China  Canada and the UK will be the highest during this period  Moreover  market research data indicates that prices are rising across the world  with the biggest increases in Central South America and the Middle East Africa  Since it is a major international player  these trends play into Priceline s sweet spot PRICELINE COM Price and EPS Surprise   What Do the Numbers SayThe company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 6 60   Not just that  the company hasn t missed estimates in any quarter since 2012  which is a very big deal and seems to indicate that this quarter will be no different But the Zacks methodology indicates that this alone may not be a reason to buy the shares heading into earnings According to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or  3  Hold  will have a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   The Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and  5  are best avoided Priceline has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of  3 77   Hence  it s difficult to predict a positive surprise  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises Summing UpPriceline belongs to an attractive industry and has a strong international presence  which is particularly positive for the business although it

108966,330481,BKNG,4 Things To Watch When Priceline Reports Earnings On Monday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
The Priceline Group  NASDAQ PCLN  a provider of travel and restaurant reservations and related services  which offers consumers an array of accommodation reservations through its Booking com  priceline com  agoda com  Kayak  Rentalcars com and OpenTable brands will release its Q3 2016 earnings report on Monday  November 7  after the closing bell 


1  Earnings and Revenue
Priceline is expected to report earnings of  29 54 per share  on  3 61 billion in revenue  representing 16 5  growth for each measure  since the company s 2015 Q3  After logging 20   growth during 2014  followed by disappointing single digit growth for full year 2015  9    PCLN is back on track to achieve substantial growth this year  of about 15   The company has registered positive revenue growth during every quarter for the past twelve years  its last negative report dates back to Q3 2004 
Founded in 1997  Priceline almost bit the dust in 2003 after a number of disastrous management decisions including inappropriate line extensions  caused the company to burn through its cash  driving down the stock to a point where management had to implement a reverse 1 for 6 split in order to remain listed  To the company s credit  since the end of 2004 Priceline shares have been on a vigorous  and seemingly endless rally 

2  Management
Too often  management specifics are given short shrift when investors make buying decisions  most likely because researching management can be difficult  and because retail investors often trust the company s board or big activist investors  if there are any   Sometimes  however  the spotlight shines directly on management  Unfortunately  when it does  it s usually not in a positive way  Darren Huston  Priceline Group s CEO since January 2014  was  this past April  after an internal investigation affirmed that a whistelblower s tip claiming Hudson was having an affair with a female employee was true and violated the company s code of conduct for Priceline executives 
Two months later  Paul Hennessy  then the CEO of the Group s flagship US based priceline com brand resigned for professional reasons  During that period  Jeff Boyd  Chairman of the Group stepped in for Hudson  and Brett Keller  Priceline s COO  became the interim CEO in place of Hennessy  While Hennessy s departure wasn t as critical  nor as fraught  and the management situation isn t yet a full blown crisis  investors and would be investors should follow these changes closely  since new leadership specifically should someone be brought in from outside the company may cause disruption in the short term 

3  Operational Results
As mentioned  Priceline has been on a growth streak for almost 12 years now  and its numbers look great  Since the beginning of the year  room nights booked through the Priceline Group s various brands grew 27  to 277 million nights  The company also makes an effort to continually expand its offering  and Booking com  its most significant brand  crossed the one million listed properties benchmark during this quarter  The company has also seen 9  growth through Rentalcars com with 34 7 million days worth of car rentals booked since January 2016  Airline tickets are the travel niche where Priceline is weakest  Only priceline com enables airline bookings  among other things  and the site has seen a decline of 7  in the number of flights booked annually 
From a revenue perspective  while the portion of the business that operates as a reservations agency such as Booking com and agoda is growing  this business brings in only a small percentage fee for each room booked  Priceline sells rooms and flights directly  including via its signature  Name Your Own Price  service   thus recouping the full transaction fee upon sale  Currently  the agency portion of the business is responsible for 70  of PCLN s total revenue  while the sales portion brings in just 21  of overall revenue and is in decline  However  there s quite a bit of good news as well  the agency segment generates almost three times more revenue than its mercantile counterpart  and is growing four times more quickly  showing 20  growth compared to a 5  decline for the sales business  We see this as the business evolving rather than regressing 

4  Competitive Challenges Ahead
Apart from a global recession which would hurt the travel business alongside the entire economy  Priceline s challenges come from direct competitors  mainly Airbnb the peer to peer online short term rental marketplace and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  which operates Hotels com and a year ago completed its purchase of Orbitz and HomeAway for  5 5 billion  For now  Priceline remains the leader of this group  and should continue to see ample growth for as long as people continue to increase the frequency with which they travel 
Conclusion
Although its price of  1445 per share may be intimidating to many  astonishingly  Priceline is not overly expensive relative to its value  Priceline strikes a fine balance between proven  past growth alongside good  still growing potential  It s a much more mature company than Expedia and trades at an earnings multiple of 27 5  compared to Expedia s 117 
Of course  with a P E of 27 5 it is still far from being a classic value play  Priceline is adequately priced at the moment and isn t a must own stock for the future  Still  barring any additional management shakeups  it s a steady  solid company to own or add to your portfolio  We see it as a traditional buy the dip play  if the dip moves the stock at least 10  lower  which would bring it below its all time high ",2016-11-07,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-things-to-watch-when-priceline-reports-earnings-on-monday-200163016,200163016
108971,330486,BKNG,Opening Bell  Risk On Returns To Markets On Positive Clinton News,opinion,"by Eli Wright
Global markets continue to be driven by the uncertainty surrounding tomorrow s US elections outcomes  Yesterday s announcement by FBI director James Comey that the re opened investigation into Mrs  Clinton s emails has been concluded with no further action to be taken has injected a note of risk on sentiment back into the markets this morning 
Asian markets reacted accordingly  the Nikkei closed at 17117 21  1 61  higher than where it ended last week  down 3 1   the Hang Seng gained  closing at 22839  up  87   the Shanghai Composite inched higher  to 3131 52 up 0 2  
In Europe this morning markets are reacting favorably to the positive news for Mrs  Clinton  the Stoxx 50 is currently up 1 37  to 2997  FTSE 100 is trading at 6781  up 1 43  at time of writing  and DAX is trading at 10403  up 1 04  
US markets experienced increased volatility on Friday  The Dow and NASDAQ both reached three month lows  each closing down 0 24  on the day  while the S P 500 edged down 0 17  and recorded its ninth straight losing session  the longest such streak since 1980  However  all three indices are up in premarket trading 
The VIX  which reached 22 51 on Friday its highest level since June is heading down  currently at 19 72  reflecting the markets  relief at the positive Clinton news 
US 10 year and 30 year bond yields are moving higher as risk appetite improves once again 
Barring any unexpected events outside the US  the week ahead will be dominated by news about the US elections  with many observers using Brexit as an analog for how markets might react in the wake of a surprise election result  Polls have largely been predicting a Clinton victory  and many analysts believe the market hasn t accurately priced in the risk of a Trump win 
If there s anything to be learned from Brexit it s that one shouldn t necessarily trust the polls  Until the final outcome of the vote is known  it s probably best to go with the prevailing trend while bracing for the possibility of a shock to the markets  at least in the short term 
Forex
Friday s NFP results were mostly solid  The headline number came in lower than expected  with 161k new jobs compared to the 175k forecast  However  unemployment ticked lower to 4 9   from 5    and average hourly earnings rose 2 8  YoY  the US dollar edged higher vs the euro and other currencies  Irrespective of recent upticks in nonfarm payroll releases  indicating a strengthening US economy and the increased possibility of a December rate hike  at the moment the only thing traders are paying attention to is the US election result 
A Clinton victory would boost the dollar and provide knock on support for the Canadian dollar  Australian dollar while safe havens such as the yen and Swiss franc could weaken  Perhaps the biggest gainer  however  would be the Mexican peso  which many see as a barometer of Trump s presidential chances  A Trump victory would send traders scrambling toward safe haven currencies and the Mexican peso would be  
Commodities
Gold  perhaps the world s most popular safe haven asset  rose 2 6  during October  but is currently down 1 45  trading at  1285  with major resistance levels at  1400 and  1500 waiting to be breached  Indeed  according to HSBC Chief Precious Metals Analyst James Steel  gold will enjoy  whoever wins the race 
Oil prices nose dived at the end of last week  after yet another OPEC deal failed to materialize  Brent closed down 8 3  on Friday  at  45 56  Crude ended the week down 9   closing at  44 11  However  currently prices are moving up 
Despite election uncertainty weighing on markets  in a positive sign for the global economy    Copper rose 3 3  on the week  to close at  2 26  trading yet higher today  currently at  2 30  Additional industrial commodities  including aluminum  nickel  and zinc  are all up as well 
Stocks
The election s affect on US markets can t be regarded in simple positive or negative terms  with a Clinton victory viewed as a driver of upward momentum and a Trump win causing prices to fall  Rather  there are likely more complex possible outcomes  In the event of a contested election  markets could get damaged when Al Gore challenged the 2000 election results   post election through December 20  a week after courts ruled in Bush s favor 
Additionally  biotech stocks appear to dislike the idea of a Clinton victory  The S P Biotech Index has fallen off a cliff down more than 26  this year  compared to a gain of 2  for the S P 500

Marriott International  NASDAQ MAR   Marriott is likely to benefit for the very same reasons as Priceline  Increasing travel demand along with continued expansion are expected to boost the quarter s results  Its recent acquisition of Starwood Resorts makes Marriott the largest hotel operator in the world and provides a huge new layer of revenue  Revisions activity has been muted despite all these positive initiatives  Fortunately  estimates are calling for a 20  increase on the bottom line and 11  on the top  reflecting a significant improvement from previous quarters  Marriott is also susceptible to many of the near term headwinds threatening Priceline and the rest of the travel industry 
Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN   Align is emerging as a popular alternative to traditional orthodontic treatment used with teens  The recently launched Invisalign G7 is expected to better facilitate tooth movement in young patients  Tying technology with dental care has propelled earnings potential in recent quarters  Align recently introduced a new treatment software that will provide a more realistic 3D visual mode to compare treatment plans  The technology is not only more cost effective but will minimize margins of error  Expectations are edging higher on these new initiatives with analysts now calling for a 60  increase in earnings and 32  in sales 
New Relic  NYSE NEWR   As has been the case with most new IPOs  New Relic has had its struggles in recent quarters  Decelerating revenue and consistent losses have led to nearly 20  decline in share prices in the past 12 months  The stock has largely recovered those losses in the past 6 months and is only down 4  since its IPO  Expectations for the quarter to be reported are largely consistent with the recent trends  Analysts are calling for a 9  increase on the bottom line and 46  on the top  reflecting a stark slowdown from prior reports  As the company continues to expand and release new products that harness the power of cloud computing  earnings growth and share prices will likely follow  We are still too early though in the maturation process to know where the long term outlook is heading

Priceline is scheduled to report second quarter earnings tomorrow  after the market closes  The online travel operator isn t a name that frequently beats or misses its expectations  This quarter might be different though  given its exposure to Europe 
Between Brexit and the recent terror attacks  travel to Europe has started to slip  Expedia cited waning demand in the region as a key factor of its undesirable results  These sentiments will likely be echoed in Priceline s conference call tomorrow 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  12 85 on  2 60 billion in revenue  18 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Compared to a year earlier  this represents a 4  increase in earnings coupled with 14  sales growth  That said  profit estimates have been cut by 6  in the last 3 months in light of Brexit and currency concerns  
In recent months  Priceline has been in the hot seat  The initial sign came during the company s first quarter earnings call when management issued weak guidance  cautioning investors of difficulties ahead  However  the bigger concern came in late June when the UK voted to leave the European Union  which sent major currencies plunging  Priceline currently generates more than two thirds of its revenue from Europe  so this could be a major blow for earnings in the near future 
Another emerging trend is the alternative accommodations segment  popularly referred to as the sharing economy  Both Priceline and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  have been bolstering their presence in this sector to compete with Airbnb  There is still room to grow here  but if Airbnb gets any bigger it could spell trouble 
Long term  Priceline still has considerable upside  The company s investment in Chinese travel company Ctrip and the handful of acquisitions made in recent years will be an important source of revenue moving forward  Investors will likely need to withstand a few down quarters before reaching potentially better results in the future

108994,330509,BKNG,Priceline Earnings Beat As Usual  Shares Up,opinion,"Priceline com   NASDAQ PCLN   beat second quarter guidance on all counts and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenue and earnings  Both agency and merchant businesses are showing strong momentum  room nights are growing much faster than in recent history  rental cars are also going strong  The only point of persistent weakness is the airline tickets PRICELINE COM Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
After Expedia s   NASDAQ EXPE   disappointing results  investors cheered the performance and for once  rewarded management for the tradition of guiding conservatively  As This was reflected in the 5 7  appreciation in share prices  
Currency did have a negative impact on the quarter s results although management had expected the impact to be neutral 
Easter falling in the first quarter this year had a negative impact on quarterly performance  especially with respect to the sequential comparison 
Terrorist attacks also had a negative impact on booking and resulted in increased cancellations in affected areas but the total impact on Priceline was negligible 
Management said that Brexit and the devaluation of British currency would have a limited impact on Priceline as UK destination gross profit and UK source gross bookings were only  around 10  of the business 
So with that  let s dive into the numbers 
Revenue
Priceline reported revenue of  2 56 billion  up 19 0  sequentially and 12 1  from the year ago quarter  Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 5  but were better than management s guidance of  2 52 billion at the mid point 
Revenue by Channel
Priceline generates the bulk of its revenue from international markets where the agency model is more popular  This is reflected in the merchant agency split of revenue  which was 22 70   in the last quarter  previous quarter split was  20 72   
Merchant revenues were up 10 2  sequentially and down 5 2  year over year  Agency revenue grew 23 5  sequentially and 17 1  year over year 
Advertising   Other revenue was up 3 9  sequentially and up 21 6  from last year  accounting for the balance  This is basically non inter company revenue from Kayak and OpenTable  of which OpenTable grew 22  year over year  The restaurant reservation service that Priceline acquired some time back is rapidly building on the number of restaurants in North America and also expanding internationally 
Room nights  rental car days and airline ticket volumes grew a respective 3 1   14 2  and 11 1  sequentially and a respective 24 4   7 6  and  4 8  from last year  Priceline s room night growth is attributable to its very geographically diverse inventory and brand recognition that tends to balance out macro uncertainties related to any one market as well as growing competition from local and international players  The company did however see ADRs declining  Rentalcars com also did quite well but there was some softness in ticket volumes 
Bookings
Priceline s overall bookings were up 7 3  sequentially and 19 4   21  in constant currency  year over year  better than guided 
Management stopped breaking out U S  and international bookings this year but is still providing some color on the respective gross profit contributions 
Merchant bookings were up 17 7  sequentially and 19 1  year over year  Agency bookings grew 5 7  sequentially and were up 19 4  from year ago levels 
Operating Performance
Priceline reported a pro forma gross margin of 95 1   up 106 basis points  bps  sequentially and up 329 bps year over year 
Because of the nature of the business and the mix of agency versus merchant revenue  management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter  Priceline s gross profit dollars were up 20 3  sequentially and 16 1   27  in constant currency  from last year  just above guidance  International gross profit grew 17   19  on a constant currency basis   U S  gross profit grew 8  year over year 
Priceline s operating income grew 30 8  sequentially and 7 6  from the  721 0 million reported last year  The operating margin of 30 3  expanded 275 bps sequentially while shrinking 128 bps from the year ago quarter  Advertising expenses as a percentage of sales grew sequentially but remained below year ago levels  Other expenses were also down sequentially and all except S M were up from last year 
Priceline reported adjusted EBITDA of  867 1 million  up 7 8  from the year ago quarter  better than management s expectations of adjusted EBITDA in the  740 795 million range 
Net Income
The pro forma net income was  649 8 million  or 25 4  of revenue  compared to  472 8 million  or 22 0  in the previous quarter and  592 8 million  or 26 0  in the year ago quarter  Our pro forma estimate excludes amortization of intangibles and other charges as well as tax adjustments  and includes stock based compensation in the last quarter 
Including these items  Priceline s GAAP net income was  580 6 million or  11 60 a share  compared to  374 4 million  or  7 47 a share in the Mar quarter and  517 0 million  or  9 94 a share in the year ago quarter 
Balance Sheet
Priceline ended with a cash and short term investments balance of  4 37 billion  up  988 2 million during the quarter  Priceline generated  966 0 million of cash from operations  It spent around  60 4 million on capex and  265 8 million on share repurchases 
At quarter end  Priceline had  7 26 billion in long term debt with the net debt position being  2 88 billion  down from a net debt position of  2 94 billion at the beginning of the quarter  Days sales outstanding  DSOs  went from 36 to around 35 
Guidance
For the second quarter  Priceline expects room nights booked to grow 18 23  and total gross bookings to grow 14 19  year over year  15 20  on a constant currency basis   This is expected to yield a year over year revenue increase of 12 17    3 55 billion at the mid point   below the  3 59 billion analysts were expecting 
Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 15 20   16 21  on a constant currency basis   with the adjusted EBITDA at  1 73  1 83 billion 
The pro forma EPS is expected to come in at  28 30  29 80  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  28 64

108995,330510,BKNG,Company Notes Digest 8 26 16,opinion,"This Week s Post  Dog Days of Summer
The last two weeks of August are typically two of the slowest weeks of the year for the business community  Not many companies were speaking this week  but the comments seemed to reflect the seasonal mood  Although the economic weakness from the beginning of the year has bottomed out  the upswing doesn t seem too exciting  It s worth noting that upswings never do feel exciting until the wall of worry has been climbed  Still  it s difficult to see how we get an acceleration in growth rates without inflation  The most optimistic actors seem to be focused on just trying to control what can be controlled 
The Macro Outlook 
Companies continue to find ways to be pleased with relatively anemic growth
 In our domestic segment  revenue increased a greater than expected 0 1  driven by comparable sales of 0 8  As it relates to our expectations  maybe our expectations were too low  But the other thing is that frankly our team is executing extremely well     Best Buy  NYSE BBY   Consumer Electronics 
CEOs are trying to stay optimistic that good execution can carry the day in a tough environment
 The consumer is going through a period around the world of uncertainty but ultimately at the end of the day if we can deliver a better experience day in and day out in our restaurants  we re confident we can win that market share fight     McDonald s  NYSE MCD  CEO Steve Easterbrook  Fast Food 
 the retail environment has softened since we last talked  and our sales are being impacted by a more cautious consumer As always  our focus is on what we can control  which includes our supply chain and inventory initiatives     Williams Sonoma  NYSE WSM  CEO Laura Alber  Home Goods 
 I think we re going to be in a more moderate growth world for a long time and a low   lower interest rate environment for a long time  but I still think that you ll be able to   good investors will still be able to make a lot of money     Brookfield Asset Management  TO BAMa  CEO Bruce Flatt  Asset Management 
Sentiment can swing rapidly when your baseline growth is close to zero
 the early part of the  fiscal  third quarter where sentiment was a bit more positive as those commodity prices were up that can change in a hurry  and it certainly with the commodity prices coming down  I think it s fair to say the overall mood would be less positive than it was a couple months ago even     Deere   Company  NYSE DE   Farm Equipment 
There continues to be a glut of inventory in a number of capital goods industries
 there continues to be a glut of trucks entering the market  And so it s been transportation  construction  and we re still seeing a decline of pricing on oil and gas related equipment  And also anything tied to mining as well    Ritchie Bros Auctioneers  NYSE RBA  SVP Doug Olive  Used Industrial Equipment 
Retailers are carrying less inventory but they may still be carrying too much
 I still believe that even with less inventory  there s so many uncertain factors out there  the macroeconomic environment  political environment  even though stores are positioned perhaps with less inventory than they have last year  that doesn t necessarily mean that  that sales will materialize    Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  CEO Barbara Rentler  Off Price Retail 
There are shortages developing in some parts of the technology supply chain though
 we are seeing on the horizon some shortages  particularly around LCDs  DRAM and Flash memory  And it s not so much coming from the PC industry  It s more coming from adjacent categories going to   glass going into televisions  memory going into phones that are likely to double density  which is putting pressure on the overall industry     HP Inc   NYSE HPQ  CEO Dion Weisler  Printers 
Wages also continue to rise
 I think we ve done a good job so far as Michael Hartshorn said in absorbing those wage rate increases in the last couple of years  But that s probably a limit to how much we can absorb      Ross Stores Inc  NASDAQ ROST  President Michael O Sullivan  Off Price Retail 
Shortages and wage increases can lead to higher inflation  The Fed is signalling that it is closer to making a move
  Employment has increased impressively over the past six years since its low point in early 2010 core PCE inflation  at 1 6 percent  is within hailing distance of 2 percent and the core consumer price index inflation rate is currently above 2 percent  So we are close to our targets     Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer  Central Bank

The British economy appears to have emerged from the Brexit vote unscathed

Europe seems very healthy to PVH
 Europe seems much healthier as a market to us  I know all the headlines about Europe and what you see  But as far as the consumers being   spending discretionary money  it s very healthy there     PVH  NYSE PVH  CEO Manny Chirico  Apparel 
There may have even been a bit of a boost
 interestingly we saw an uptrend in the UK sales almost immediately following the vote  We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination     Tiffany  NYSE TIF  IR Mark Aaron  Jewelry 
It s really too early to tell though
 we saw very  very limited impact from Brexit  so  Q3 was really a non event  On a go forward basis  it s unclear exactly what the impact is going to be  We are definitely seeing and  in some cases  following with our own pricing increases  What s less clear is what is going to be the impact on demand And it s just too early to tell     HP Inc   NYSE HPQ  CFO Cathie Lesjak  Printers 
Canadian regulators are taking a closer look at home price appreciation
 Regulatory bodies are also responding to the combination of rising house prices and record levels of consumer leverage  We support the Canadian federal government s recent action to form a working group to study the housing market and develop appropriate recommendations     Royal Bank Of Canada  NYSE RY  CEO David McKay  Bank 
The impact of currency fluctuations on financial results are starting to balance out
 There was no translation effect on total sales as the stronger yen offset the negative translation effects from the stronger US dollar against other currencies     Tiffany IR Mark Aaron  Jewelry

The financial industry is being very cautious with capital spending
 discretionary spending in the banking sector remained soft  weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and a prolonged low interest rate environment We see the banking sector being more cautious in spending over the near term     Cognizant Technology Solutions  NASDAQ CTSH   IT Consulting 
Consumer 
There may be some weakness in the high end consumer
 There s obviously some strength out there in different parts of retail  In apparel specifically  the environment remains challenging  and quite frankly  it remains most challenging in the higher end of the market     Gap Inc   NYSE GPS  CEO Arthur Peck  Apparel 
 We can only speculate on why domestic US consumer spending at the high end has been generally soft  but we believe that macro market and political uncertainties are likely playing a role in restrained consumer behavior     Tiffany IR Mark Aaron  Breakfast 
If there is weakness at the high end  Toll Brothers isn t seeing it though
  While there has been a lot of discussion about weakness in the luxury new home market  we just aren t seeing it based on this quarters contract growth across all of our regions    Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  CEO Douglas Yearley  Homebuilder 
The retail landscape continues to be very promotional
 when the industry s on sale 365 days a year  when there s free delivery  when there s 70  off merchandise  I don t think the promotional activity can get much stronger     La Z Boy  NYSE LZB  CEO Kurt Darrow  Home Goods 
More athletic apparel is sold for fashion than function

PVH believes that it is close to profitable scale in e commerce
 And I think from a pure profitability point of view  the only issue we re dealing with on our own e commerce sites is scale  As that business continues to grow we re 12 months away from going from a loss position on those businesses to a profit position on those businesses we truly are becoming agnostic about where the customer shops     PVH  NYSE PVH  CEO Manny Chirico  Apparel

of companies that have reported so far  This has lured investors back to the equity markets from safe haven assets like government bond and gold As investors scout for cherry pickings  they are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE   A Key Financial MetricROE   Net Income Shareholders  EquityROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is a useful tool for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify those stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher investor returns instead of piling up the dry powder Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  However  these are not the ultimate criteria for short listing stocks  As such  we have added a few additional criteria to arrive at a winning strategy    Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of its assets  which include cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength    Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform

Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   Expedia and Priceline  NASDAQ PCLN  are neck and neck in the race for supremacy in the online travel industry  Expedia s report today will be a benchmark for Priceline in the next couple weeks  Expedia itself is coming off a promising first quarter  topping expectations on both the top and bottom line  The company has been quick to snatch up its competitors and consolidate the industry  Past acquisitions such as Travelocity and HomeAway provide Expedia with new revenue streams that aren t likely to cannibalize its business  Based on the success of the airlines  travel trends also appear to be picking up  which bodes well for Expedia  The biggest concern  however  is Brexit and what it means for future travel and currency translation  Any indication of it having an adverse impact on future earnings could send the stock into a tailspin

109054,330569,BKNG,Priceline Will Not Stop This Time,opinion,"There has been a force field in place around Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN   The 1365 price area will not stop it this time as it s time to make a move to the upside 
The chart below gives several reasons why  After completing a bearish Butterfly harmonic in early November  the PCLN reversed  A lot  It retraced over 150  of the Butterfly  But what is interesting in that downward move is where it started  The gap down day opened at 1362 60  And that price area has been a brick wall ever since 

It took until the market bottom in February for the destruction to end  Then with a gap up over the 200 day SMA it cruised higher to 1361  Another pullback to the 200 day SMA  then it ran back up to 1369  A second pullback broke through the 200 day and oscillated around it for a month  As it did so  the Bollinger Bands  squeezed in and the momentum indicators found their bottom  As the RSI and MACD started higher  the Bollinger Bands opened to the upside and it has been a quick move back to 1373 
Slightly higher highs  Will the third time be the charm  Momentum supports continuation as do the opening Bollinger Bands  A break into the gap has until 1430 to fill it  And a Measured Move from the February low supports a lot more  up to 1650  A close over 1380 could be considered a buy trigger against a stop at that 1360 area or slightly below ",2016-06-07,Gregory W.

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for a loss of 63 cents per share on  636 13 million in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  3 million on the top
Ctrip has seen revenue steadily rise while earnings decline over the past 2 years
The travel industry is still one of the fastest growing industries which bodes well for industry leading Ctrip 
Chinese travel has been a fast growing industry in the past few years  prompting travel booking companies to rush to get a piece of the pie  Ctrip has reaped the rewards of this trend  posting better than expected earnings in each quarter of 2015  However early indications look as though the company will disappoint investors when it kicks off fiscal 2016 
The Estimize consensus is calling for a loss of 63 cents per share on  636 13 million in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  3 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier profitability is projected to decline by 656  while sales could increase 70   Earnings per share estimates have been cut over 1000  since its last report  reflecting the company s inability to turn a profit  Given the sudden downward momentum  it s not surprising that the stock has fallen 17 8  in the past 6 months 
The booming travel industry in China has been the primary driver of steadily increasing revenue in the last 2 years  Last quarter  revenue grew 50  on increases in net commision  accommodation reservation and transportation ticketing  Leisure and outbound tourism have been the two biggest drivers in the travel market and are seeing the largest gains  Ctrip should have no problem generating revenue as it holds a dominant market share in the region 
Recent partnerships with eLong and Qunar are expected to propel Ctrip s market share in Chinese hotel and airline bookings to about 70  80   Moreover  Priceline s  NASDAQ PCLN  recent  500 million investment in Ctrip will help bolster its expansion in outbound travel  Ctrip s consolidation of the Chinese travel industry and growth in the global market gives it the scale and distribution power to generate more meaningful margins 
While Ctrip maintains a stranglehold in the China travel industry  its mounting losses could become problem in the near future  if it hasn t already  Shareholders could bare the brunt of its shortcomings if Ctrip is unable to turn a profit ",2016-06-15,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-this-travel-company-soar-on-earnings-200136003,200136003
109056,330571,BKNG,What s The Best Internet Stock For The Summer ,opinion," Internet stock  is a reference to a rather broad spectrum of companies that depend on the Internet for revenue  This includes content providers  platform providers  data aggregators and various other facilitators including software makers 
Here I m narrowing it down to Internet retailers including platforms like Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and eBay   NASDAQ EBAY    daily deal providers like Groupon   NASDAQ GRPN    retailers like Petmed Express   NASDAQ PETS    Blue Nile   NASDAQ NILE   and CNOVA NV and travel booking service providers like Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN   and Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   
The secular drivers for this market in the last few quarters have been and continue to be mobile device adoption and the transfer of offline shoppers to online channels 
In fact  free shipping is now the norm in most cases and the convenience of armchair shopping with no waiting lines and no load to carry have also pretty much been taken for granted  Feedback from other shoppers is also easily available  further easing the purchasing process 
Adding to these very strong drivers are social networking platforms like Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twitter and other online players like Alphabet s Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  that create online real estate for advertising and also supply effective tools that help advertisers track the ad to the sale  direct response ads are one such format   So online retailers can generate traffic from Internet users on other services through the ads they place on the web  And netizens continue to increase as a natural corollary to mobile device adoption 
The question that arises then is the sustainability of this model  It s obvious that not all sales will move online  Online retailers are damaging traditional retailers  many of which have however been building goodwill and customer relations  Some customers also prefer to look and feel the things they re buying and the personal touch that friendly sales staff bring   
But the items being sold online are also increasing as customers are increasingly comfortable buying high value items online  Additionally  online retailers have greater access to customers because of the Internet so selling internationally has become much easier  especially with platforms like Amazon that facilitate sales  So growth can slow down but isn t about to go away 
Zacks Rank
Choosing a stock in a market with a large number of variables can be tricky  But when you ve got the Zacks Rank as guide  you need look no further 
Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have a good chance of appreciation within the next month or so  So adding them to the portfolio can lead to short term gains 
Unfortunately  most of the companies in the sector have various issues and therefore can t be recommended  Also  the sector being in growth mode means that valuations might not make a whole lot of sense 
Randomly picking up and comparing companies we find that some have posted strong earnings surprises over the past year  However  they all have Zacks Ranks of  3  Hold  or lower  meaning Sell rated  a low VGM score  meaning that neither value nor growth nor momentum investors would fancy them   
One stock stands out  however  and that is Petmed Express  So that s the one we are highlighting today 
Petmed Express 
Petmed Express is America s largest pet pharmacy  delivering prescription and non prescription pet medications and health and nutritional supplements for dogs and cats at competitive prices direct to the consumer through its 1 800 PetMeds toll free number and on the Internet 
The company reported fourth quarter results on May 9  but despite an initial positive reaction to the news  shares have fallen off slightly since then  Results nonetheless are positive  showing revenue  earnings  new orders  re orders and average order value growth from the year ago quarter  Customer acquisition accelerated to 116K from 97K a year ago 
Management attributed the results to the unseasonably warmer weather that helped flea and tick demand  Most significantly  customer acquisition cost was down from  42 to  32  Another positive is the balance sheet where the company has a healthy cash balance and no debt  This might be something that will change in the future though as it moves to expand its online advertising and sales   
The best part of all  Petmeds has a Zacks Rank  1  Its 1 16 beta indicates relatively low risk  Moreover  our value style score for the stock is B  so value investors might want to accumulate the shares

109057,330572,BKNG,Priceline Group Inc Pops After Upgrade,opinion,"The Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN  received a key upgrade from analysts at Barclays this morning  They moved from Equal Weight to Overweight and raised their price target 15  from  1 300 to  1 500 per share  saying that there isn t much priced into the current valuation  Analysts at Piper Jaffray issued a positive report on the online travel firm on Tuesday  while Cantor Fitzgerald issued a positive report on it last week 
Barclays raises earnings estimates for Priceline
Barclays analyst Christopher Merwin said he has been expecting Priceline to enjoy long term structural growth in what s a  compelling end market   and he also likes the company s strong execution track record  Despite these positives  he thinks investors are pricing in a  fairly bearish scenario of falling take rates and margin de leverage  and that the near term concerns create a buying opportunity for investors 
He added that the  only amplified the bearish sentiment  but he thinks the reasons for the weak outlook were mostly related to timing and thus don t impact his long term view of the company  Management had warned that sporting events and the timing of Ramadan could be headwinds for summer travel  but Merwin believes this will simply shift demand into late in the second quarter and early in the first quarter  resulting in a net neutral impact for the year 
He believes take rates are finally stabilizing as the transition to the agency model is almost finished  and he expects margins to improve as time goes on and ad spend moves toward channels with higher returns on investment  just as it has on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   He estimates that Priceline spends more than 80  of its marketing dollars on Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  where return on investment has started to decline  but he expects the company to gradually shift this spend over to Facebook and other channels with better return on investment 
Is Priceline s new CEO too conservative 
Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson is also bullish but with a slightly different take on the issues facing Priceline as he believes the recent CEO change is driving guidance that s too conservative  He noted that in the past  the company has guided overly conservatively during times of macroeconomic issues and internal shifts like getting a new CEO  He explained that in 27 of the last 30 quarters  the company beat pre guidance bookings growth consensus  Additionally  in three of the five quarters in which it guided the high end of bookings growth below the consensus  it outperformed 
Olson already had an Overweight rating and  1 500 per share price target  both of which he maintained in his June 21 report  As a result  he sees a favorable risk  reward in owning the online travel firm s stocks as the  over conservative  stands  against a backdrop of stable global travel trends  
The analyst expects margin expansion in the second half of this year because he sees the outlook for 575 basis points of margin compression as being too conservative  and almost definitely not something to extrapolate throughout the year  
Positive checks for Priceline
Last week Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Naved Khan and team said last week that their intra quarter checks for the second quarter were positive  They have a Buy rating and  1 525 price target on Priceline 
They said that although growth in travel demand eased in April and May compared to first quarter levels  the second quarter room nights growth and bookings seem to be heading toward the high end of management s guidance  They said room rates increased 2 8  in Europe on a currency neutral basis  while occupancy increased 1 4   Additionally  they report that worldwide searches for Booking com were ahead of expectations  rising 100 basis points in the U K  and Germany and 800 basis points in the U S  but declined 900 basis points in France 
Based on search trends for Booking com  Priceline itself  and Agoda plus mobile booking growth  they believe the company is at the upper end of guidance for 22  growth in room nights and 18  in bookings

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share  9 85 on  2 13 billion in revenue  15 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  8 million on top
Priceline recently partnered with TripAdvisor to feed Instant Booking with inventory
Priceline operates in a heavily concentrated industry with names like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE 
What are you expecting for  
Lately the online travel industry has been one of the hottest industries much to the delight of Priceline and its peers  In the past 3 months  shares of Priceline skyrocketed 23  on indications of a reversing trend in the travel industry  Both Marriot International  NASDAQ MAR  and Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  s better than expected earnings reinforce that travel demand is rebounding  For Priceline  this sets the stage for another strong quarter  in what could be the 9th consecutive beat on the bottom line 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share  9 85 on  2 13 billion in revenue  15 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  8 million on top  Both Estimize and Wall Street are high on Priceline this quarter  topping corporate guidance by nearly 50 cents  Compared to a year earlier  EPS is forecasted to grow 21  with revenue expected to climb 15   Given Priceline s track record  it s not surprising that the stock is a frequent mover around earnings season  In the 30 days leading up to earnings  Priceline shares witness a 4  increase and cool down to 2  gains through earnings  
Priceline s fourth quarter was highlighted by significant gains on both the top and bottom line  This featured a 10  increase in gross travel bookings  12  increase in international operations  and continued growth in Booking com  Priceline has guided for double digit growth in almost all key metrics for the first quarter  Including a 20 27  increase in room nights booked  total gross travel booking growth of 12 19  and gross profits increasing 12 21  
Unlike Expedia  Priceline has a far bigger position in international markets which could be hurt from unfavorable currency headwinds and a slowdown in China  On the brightside  the travel industry has not been materially impacted from recent terror attacks in Europe  That said  the industry is highly competitive across Expedia  Google  TripAdvisor  AirBnB and Priceline  The competitive landscape in online travel is just another roadblock for Priceline in the near future

109075,330590,BKNG,Priceline Earnings Top Estimates  Guidance Disappoints,opinion,"Priceline com   NASDAQ PCLN   beat first quarter guidance on all counts and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenue and earnings  Both agency and merchant businesses are showing strong momentum  room nights are growing much faster than in recent history  rental cars are also going strong  The only point of weakness that we can tell at this point is the airline tickets  which could be a onetime affair  we ll probably know more on the call  
But investors moved straight on to the guidance  which was conservative as usual  This is one of the reasons the shares have been punished in the past and they are being punished again today 
One good thing is that the company is not expecting any currency impact in the next quarter 
So with that  let s dive into the numbers 
Revenue
Priceline reported revenue of  2 15 billion  up 7 4  sequentially and 16 7  from the year ago quarter  Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 3  and were also better than management s guidance of  2 07 billion at the mid point 
Revenue by Channel
Priceline generates the bulk of its revenue from international markets where the agency model is more popular  This is reflected in the merchant agency split of revenue  which was 22  70   in the last quarter  previous quarter split was  22  70   
Merchant revenues were up 5 4  sequentially and down 5 0  year over year  Agency revenue grew 7 1  sequentially and 25 1  year over year 
Advertising   Other revenue was up 16 0  sequentially and up 21 4  from last year  accounting for the balance 
Room nights  rental car days and airline ticket volumes grew a respective 37 7   32 8  and 5 9  sequentially and a respective 30 5   11 0  and  10 0  from last year 
Bookings
Priceline s overall bookings were up 38 6  sequentially and 20 9  year over year  better than guided  Gross bookings of  16 7 billion grew 21  from last year  or 26  in constant currency  again better than guided 
Management stopped breaking out U S  and international bookings from this quarter but is still providing some color on the respective gross profit contributions 
Merchant bookings were up 26 9  sequentially and 13 5  year over year  Agency bookings grew 40 5  sequentially and were up 22 1  from year ago levels  Both growth rates display strength versus a year ago  
Operating Performance
Priceline reported a pro forma gross margin of 94 0   up 4 basis points  bps  sequentially and up 405 bps year over year 
Because of the nature of the business and the mix of agency versus merchant revenue  management usually uses gross profit dollars rather than margin to gauge performance during any quarter  Priceline s gross profit dollars were up 7 5  sequentially and 22 0   27  in constant currency  from last year  better than guided  International gross profit grew 23   31  on a constant currency basis  
Priceline s operating income dropped 15 4  sequentially but was up 28 6  from the  460 9 million reported last year  The operating margin of 27 6  shrank 744 bps sequentially but expanded 255 bps from the year ago quarter  Advertising selling and marketing expenses increased sequentially as a percentage of sales  Advertising and personnel costs also increased from last year 
Priceline reported adjusted EBITDA of  676 3 million  up 27 2  from the year ago quarter  better than management s expectations of adjusted EBITDA in the  580 620 million range 
Net Income
The pro forma net income was  472 8 billion  or 22 0  of revenue  compared to  561 5 billion  or 28 1  in the previous quarter and  375 4 million  or 20 4  in the year ago quarter  Our pro forma estimate excludes amortization of intangibles and other charges as well as tax adjustments  and includes stock based compensation in the last quarter 
Including these items  Priceline s GAAP net income was  374 4 million or  7 47 a share  compared to  504 3 million  or  10 00 a share in the December quarter and  333 3 million  or  6 36 a share in the year ago quarter 
Balance Sheet
Priceline ended with a cash and short term investments balance of  3 38 billion  up  734 3 million during the quarter  Priceline generated  344 3 million of cash from operations  It spent around  53 3 million on capex and  259 4 million on share repurchases 
At quarter end  Priceline had  6 32 billion in long term debt with the net debt position being  2 94 billion  down from a net debt position of  3 51 billion at the beginning of the quarter  Days sales outstanding  DSOs  went from 29 to around 36 
Guidance
For the second quarter  Priceline expects room night bookings to grow 15 22  and total gross bookings to grow 11 18  year over year  11 18  on a constant currency basis   This is expected to yield a year over year revenue increase of 7 14    2 52 billion at the mid point   below the  2 69 billion analysts were expecting 
Priceline expects gross profit dollars to increase 9 16   9 16  on a constant currency basis   with the adjusted EBITDA at  740 million to  795 million 
The pro forma EPS is expected to come in at  11 60  12 50  well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  14 12

109082,330597,BKNG,Priceline Group Stock Declining Despite Solid Earnings,opinion,"Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN 
Priceline Group is having an incredibly hard day in the market today  and for good reason  The company recently reported its earnings  and while earnings came in far ahead of analyst expectations  guidance was not exactly what investors wanted to see  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from the earnings report  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from PCLN moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
PCLN Reports Strong Earnings  But Weak Guidance
As mentioned above  Priceline Group is having an incredibly hard day in the market today after reporting its earnings  While earnings and revenue were strong  guidance proved to be a cause for concern  Here s what we saw from the report   
Earnings   In terms of earnings per share  PCLN did incredibly well  During the first quarter  analysts expected that the company would generate earnings in the amount of  9 66 per share  However  the company actually reported earnings  0 88 ahead of expectations  coming in at  10 54 per share 
Revenue   Revenue also proved to be an incredibly strong point for PCLN  During the quarter  analysts expected that the company would generate revenue in the amount of  2 12 billion  However  the company actually reported revenue in the amount of  2 15 billion  about  30 million ahead of expectations 
Guidance   While revenue and earnings were overwhelmingly positive  there was one area where Priceline Group concerned investors  That area was guidance  The company said that in the second quarter  it is expecting to generate earnings in the range between  11 60 per share and  12 50 per share  While this would represent strong quarter over quarter growth  it does represent a relatively large drop from the current consensus estimate of  14 98 per share 
As you can see from the information above  the earnings report released was positive  but guidance is a big of a concern  In a statement  Jeffery H  Boyd  Chairman and Interim CEO at PCLN had the following to offer with regard to the quarter s performance 
 The Priceline Group delivered strong top line growth and attractive margins in the first quarter    Growth in room night reservations of 31  reflects continued solid execution in the market for global travel    The Group is looking forward to continued investments in product  service and branding that will drive long term growth for our leading brands  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  With PCLN beating expectations with regard to both revenue and earnings  at first glance the earnings report was overwhelmingly positive  However  with the poor guidance in mind  investors are taking the news as negative overall  As a result  we re seeing declines in the value of the stock today  Currently  9 48   PCLN is trading at  1 235 45 per share after a loss of  119 19 per share or 8 80  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively mixed opinion of what we can expect to see from the Priceline Group  In the short term  we re likely to see further declines as concerns over guidance remain  However  in the long run  I have a bullish opinion of what we can expect to see  PCLN has done an incredible job with branding  product management  and sales  and in the long run  I don t expect for this to change

109083,330598,BKNG,Market Holding On By A Thread,opinion,"The Nasdaq has long ago broken down below all key  exponential moving averages  Bad action there  but this has been an S P 500 bull market for the most part the last year plus  The Nasdaq has been performing poorly due to those higher beta  higher P E stocks the big money wants nothing to do with  Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN  was down 100  today on their earnings report  No mercy anywhere if you have higher P E stocks  The big boys and girls want lower beta  They want lower P E and they want lower risk  A healthy bull is a frothing bull  It s been gone for some time now  That said  the market has remained resilient as you know thanks to Ms Yellen  and her good tidings for the bulls in the form of low rates and lots of stimulus  Mr Draghi  over in Europe  has done his fair share of keeping things up as well  Will they be able to keep this up  I don t know  of course  and neither do any of you  It is the mystery of this market  and also what makes it so tough  Trying to playing on its own is tough  but when you add in interference from the fed  it makes it that much harder to figure out the puzzle 
Today was a day for the bears as they are nearing the break down level on the S P 500  which  to be exact  is 2043  or where the fifty day exponential moving average currently lives  The Nasdaq has long ago lost all of those key averages  but for the market to confirm a true trend change the S P 500 needs to confirm the Nasdaq breakdown  Ever so close for the bears  We saw another gap down today followed by additional selling as the day went along  The S P 500 getting within a couple of points of breaking down  but finding enough energy to barely hold off the bears  The damage today allowed the bears to break this down tomorrow with a gap if they have what it takes  which they usually don t  but just may this time  For the bulls  it would be great if they gap it down  but run it back up and close with a bottoming stick  That would at least hold off the bears for a little while longer  No guarantee for good  but would allow them to catch their breath  They could use a time out here as the selling has been very intense  Bottom line is today allowed the bears to see the light in terms of changing the short  to medium term trend 
Markets are always interesting  If you ve watched the financial stocks over the past many months you ve been a guest in to the world of make believe and hope  We know that these stocks do well when interest rates are rising  If not rising just the perception that they will is more than enough  That happens when there s good economic news because that gets folks to believe fed Yellen will start a rate hike cycle  and if not a cycle  at least some further rate hikes  However  reality comes back when we see bad economic reports come in  We ve had quite a few lately from the ISM Manufacturing Report to the GDP number to the ADP payrolls number today  Not good since this puts the fed on hold for further rate hikes  The overall perception is they won t be raising rates any time soon  and  thus  the banks are now struggling once again  Without the financial stocks participating in the up side it s hard to imagine the S P 500 not losing key support at some point in the future  We shall see  but the market needs a few good reports  and they need them badly and they need them very soon  The financial stocks will be worth watching daily here 
So support held at the end of the day  Good news for the moment  but we re at an inflection point here folks  If we do lose 2043 with force  we deal with the 200 day exponential moving average next at 2020  If we lose 2020 we see the 1900 s very quickly in all likelihood  For this market to break out one would think the fed has done all she can  thus  it ll need something it s not getting  That would be real economic growth and a real pick up in earnings  They are on the decline  and in many cases it s quite severe  Keep an open mind  Let s see if the fed has any more tricks up her sleeves  Day to day with our sole focus being S P 500 2043 ",2016-05-05,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-holding-on-by-a-thread.-200128051,200128051

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS or  11 96  13 cents higher than Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  1 987 billion  roughly  11 million higher than the Street
Priceline has invested heavily in developing operations in China which is viewed as the fastest growing travel market in the world
Despite currency headwinds  Priceline has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters 
For years  online travel has been a high growth industry  but recent headwinds have come at the expense of profit growth for Priceline  PCLN  and its peers  Lately  though  the impact of stiffer competition  weaker conditions in China and currency headwinds have put Priceline under pressure  In the last 3 months  shares have fallen 18 5   leading to a downgrade of its rating from buy to neutral 
Coming into Priceline s fourth quarter earnings  investors are increasingly nervous about the company s ability to regain its earnings potential  The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS or  11 96  13 cents higher than Wall Street  and revenue expectations of  1 987 billion  roughly  11 million higher than the Street  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY increase in EPS by 11  and revenue by 8   Priceline has consistently delivered positive earnings surprises  beating in each of the trailing four quarters  This is a company that often beats on the bottom line  surpassing the Estimize EPS estimates 94  of the time 
A substantial part of the plunge in share prices came after Priceline s third quarter earnings  when the company delivered weak guidance about future earnings  However  nothing has changed in the business s core strengths as Priceline continues to deliver impressive earnings despite weak economic conditions 
The company s sheer volume in available properties compared to its peers  has put Priceline in a position in which it can afford to place excess inventory on TripAdvisor s Instant Booking platform without giving up its competitive advantage  The company s recent partnership with Facebook  O FB  and the open integration of OpenTable in its legacy platforms are expected to gain further traction 
Despite a weakened economy in China  Priceline sees huge potential there  as the expanding Chinese middle class has led to increased travel  China is arguably the most sought after travel market in the world  projected to eclipse  75 billion in revenue by 2017  Priceline has sought partnerships in the region  including pumping  2 billion in Ctrip  China s leading travel booking site  Moving forward  Priceline should see further market share gains across international markets as currency headwinds subside 

While Priceline remains dominant against direct competitors such as Expedia  O EXPE  and TripAdvisor  they are starting to see stiff competition from vacation rental sites such as Airbnb and even Google  O GOOGL   Amid concerns that Airbnb is infringing on Priceline s user base  major banks downgraded the company s stock rating to neutral 
Google  on the other hand  aggregates travel resources on its website  eliminating the need to visit sites like Priceline  That said  if Priceline can deliver better than expected earnings to cap off fiscal 2015  then it should be able to regain recent losses ",2016-02-16,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/priceline-expected-to-report-strong-q4-earnings:-here’s-what-to-watch-200118486,200118486

However when Priceline released its better than expected financials in February  Wall Street had a change of heart  and the stock quickly bounced back up  Priceline shares have been steadily climbing since early February  It has gained back all of its January losses and has currently returned about 6  year to date 
Many investors consider Priceline to be a blue chip company that is relatively safe  It s also 97  owned by institutional investors so there is a lot of smart money invested in Priceline at the moment  The only thing that might be considered a problem for income investors is that PCLN doesn t pay a dividend  This could be a deal breaker for some  but fundamentally the company is still growing at a very generous rate  According to Thomson Reuters Stock Reports  the annual Earnings Per Share trend going forward for PCLN is that the company will make  69 share this year   81 share in 2017  and then  93 in 2018  Since most analysts are expecting a 20  EPS growth for PCLN this year  the 27x price to earnings ratio makes sense given how stable the travel industry is most of the time  Even though the current P E ratio is 27  the forward P E ratio is a more modest 16x  With a current ratio of 2 5 times  the company s balance sheet looks rather stable as well 
It s easy to see how investors are torn about this stock  On one hand it has a decent earnings growth potential and could be more profitable in the future  But on the other hand the stock appears to be fully valued  In fact the 12 month target for the stock ranges from  1250 per share on the low side which is about 8  lower than its current market value  to  1470 on the high side  which is about 9  higher than the stock s current price 
Airbnb may be a threat to Priceline  but the two companies ultimately serve different segments of the travel industry  Even though Airbnb has expanded to many countries and has disrupted traditional travel businesses  it will not replace the professional and predictable properties of the hotel business  The fact that hotel room prices have not fallen over the past 5 years is an indication that the market is large enough for both Airbnb and traditional hotels to operate  As oil continues to be cheap  more people should be willing to travel  and Priceline will be able to take advantage of that by making money on rental cars  hotels  and other accommodations  Although Airbnb and other companies may compete in this space  Priceline still appears to be the global leader in the travel industry

109106,330621,BKNG,Can Priceline  PCLN  Stock Post An Earnings Surprise This Q1 ,opinion,"Priceline   NASDAQ PCLN   is slated to report first quarter earnings results on May 4 after the bell 
The company has been in the news recently because its CEO Darren Huston resigned recently following an internal investigation on his personal conduct with a female employee  One would have thought that such news would lead to investor concern about the company s future given the competitive and dynamic market scenario  But the company assured us that there were suitable people to take over his roles  former CEO and current Chairman Jeffery Boyd as interim CEO of Priceline com and Gillian Tans as CEO of Booking com  
Another factor  and perhaps the more significant one  was Expedia s strong results that made investors optimistic about Priceline s results as well  To see if the optimism is justified  let s take a quick look at how it has been doing recently 
Quarter Four Highlights
In the last quarter  Priceline beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines  It exceeded its own  albeit conservative  guidance on revenue  bookings  EBITDA and earnings 
Currency continued to pressure results since most of the business is generated overseas  But the company grew ADR  revenue and margins regardless  after adjusting for seasonality  
The relatively benign oil prices had a positive impact on consumer discretionary spending  Also  air tickets were cheaper as a result  another incentive for people to spend on air travel 
For the first quarter  Priceline estimated that room night bookings would grow 20 27  and total gross bookings would grow 12 19  year over year  18 25  on a local currency basis   Gross profit dollars were expected to increase 14 21   20 27  on a constant currency basis   with the adjusted EBITDA at  580 million to  620 million  The pro forma EPS was expected to be  9 00  9 60  based on a 16  tax rate and 50 5 million shares  The GAAP EPS was expected to be  6 90 to  7 50 
The Industry Is Attractive
The U S  Commerce Department estimates international travel to the U S  will grow at a CAGR of 3 1  from 2015 to 2020  Visitor volume is expected to grow from 0 4  in 2015 to 2 6  this year  Inbound travel volumes from Mexico  China  Canada and the UK will be the highest during this period  Moreover  market research data indicates that prices are rising across the world  with the biggest increases in Central South America and the Middle East Africa  Since it is a major international player  these trends play into Priceline s sweetspot 
What Do the Numbers Say 
The company has topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 4 81   Not just that  the company hasn t missed estimates in any quarter since 2012  which is a very big deal and seems to indicate that this quarter will be no different 
But the Zacks methodology indicates that caution may be in order 
According to Zacks  a company with a Buy  Zacks Rank  1 or  2  or Hold rating  Zacks Rank  3  will have a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive ESP  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and  5  are best avoided 
Priceline satisfies neither of the criteria since it has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and ESP 0 00  Hence it s difficult to predict a positive surprise 
Besides  valuation looks rich  which could mean limited upward movement in response to results  Priceline s price chart shows that a positive surprise hasn t always led to an upward movement in share prices  So this is another reason for caution 
Summing Up
Priceline belongs in an attractive industry and has a strong international presence  which is particularly positive for business although it means that FX is always an important factor  The company has a solid history of positive surprises and this quarter may not be different  However  given its Zacks Rank  2 and rich valuation it is difficult to recommend the shares at this point 
Safer bets would be Travelport Worldwide   NYSE TVPT    which has a Zacks Rank  1 or Mercadolibre   NASDAQ MELI    which has a Zacks Rank  2 ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-priceline-(pcln)-stock-post-an-earnings-surprise-this-q1-200127399,200127399
109107,330622,BKNG,What To Watch When H  HOT And MGM Report This Week,opinion,"Changing trends and preferences over the past 5 years has put the hotel industry in the hot seat while giving the consumer more options  Companies like Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE  and Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN  provide thorough price comparisons across the whole industry to help consumers make more informed choices  while Airbnb bypasses hotels all together  providing alternative lodging arrangements  Regardless  many of these trends have left hotel companies vulnerable to inventory accumulation and deep discounts  However  early indications this earnings season suggest those trends might be beginning to turnaround  
Last week we got strong earnings from Marriot International  NASDAQ MAR  and Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE   suggesting that hotel demand is gaining traction  This week we get results from Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE H   Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  and MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM  and perhaps a clearer picture of where the hotel industry is headed 

Hyatt Hotels Corporation    Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports May 3  Before Market Opens
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of a quarter on  1 09 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  6 million on top  Compared to a year earlier  profits are forecasted to rise 122  with revenue increasing a meager 3   On average  the stock comes into earnings season with positive momentum and tails off soon thereafter  Investors are looking for anything to spark share prices which are down 17 4  from a year earlier  
What to Watch  Hyatt is coming off a mixed fourth quarter in which it topped revenue expectations but fell short on profitability  Much of this dichotomy was due to strength in the U S  markets and weakness globally  Domestic markets saw key metrics like RevPAR  revenue per available room  increase across all reporting segments  RevPAR for full services domestic hotels increased 4 2   group room revenue increased 8 3  and select service hotels increased 6 4   Hyatt also added nine new hotels to its portfolio across a number of major cities in the United States 
On the other hand  Hyatt fared far worse in international markets primarily driven by unfavorable exchange rates and the continued slowdown in China  The hotel company saw double digit declines in Europe  Africa and Middle East segments with Asia Pacific segments declining nearly 5   Unfortunately  many of Hyatt s past problems will continue to pose a threat this quarter 
Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide    Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports May 3  Before Market Opens
The Estimize community is looking for earnings per share of  0 61 on  1 35 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  6 million in sales  Compared to a year earlier  profits are expected to fall 6  with sales falling as much as 4   Luckily  the stock doesn t move much leading up and through earnings seasons so a slightly disappointing earnings shouldn t be a setback 

What to Watch  The biggest news this quarter has been the back and forth negotiations between Starwood and Marriott  After all the hoopla  it would seem as if Starwood is going to be bought by Marriott instead of China s Anbang that had placed a bid  The deal should benefit companies and consumers with substantial synergies  Meanwhile  more than half of Starwood s properties are located outside the U S  which significantly exposes them to exchange rate fluctuations and weakness in China  Last quarter  Starwood saw RevPar increase in North American locations but decline over 5  in all of its international segments 
Nevertheless  earnings are expected to improve in North America moving forward while volatility abroad persists 
MGM Resorts International    Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports May 3  Before Market Opens
The Estimize consensus is looking for EPS of  0 13 on revenue of  2 29 billion  right in line with Wall Street on the bottom and nearly  20 million below on the top  Earnings per share estimates have dropped 17  since its last report and contribute to a forecasted 55  decline in profitability  Despite steadily declining earnings and a big miss last quarter  the stock has remained unscathed 

What to Watch  All eyes will be on casino performance in Las Vegas and Macau when MGM reports this week  The company is expecting steadily improving demand at its properties in Las Vegas to offset sluggish growth in Macau  Last quarter saw room revenue from Las Vegas increase 10  with a 12  increase in RevPAR while MGM China witnessed a decrease of 31  and 29   respectively  The Chinese government s focus on boosting tourism in the region may provide some relief from the ongoing decline in traffic and revenue 
On the other hand  MGM Las Vegas is expected to continue to grow over the long term  driven by a strong event calendar and several successful investments on the Strip  MGM is also poised to spin off its properties to create a REIT to strengthen its balance sheet  The REIT will initially hold nine MGM resorts  6 of them in Las Vegas  which could raise as much as  1 2 billion at a  18 to  21 price range  Overall  strong performances from Las Vegas  non gaming sectors and a lucrative REIT spinoff should be enough to weather MGM s losses from Macau

109136,330651,BKNG,The Real Bounce,opinion," An obstacle is often a stepping stone   Prescott

If breakouts or breakdowns do not work then chances are we go the other way and we saw many breakdowns fail today so I did buy a few in medium size like SPDR S P 500  N SPY   Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL  and I also tried Priceline com Incorporated  O PCLN  but stopped out just under cost since it was acting a bit strange and that one can gap huge so I didn t want to risk it 
I m still very cautious but we need a bounce and we ve got the surest sign of it being here for real now and I ll talk about that  being iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  N TLT   later on in tonights full letter 
So  while the bounce does finally look to be here  and real I have to watch closely and make sure we don t see the strength sold into as we have seen  or I ll be back to cash quickly 
The damage is very severe to the charts so there will likely be more downside at some point which will take us to new lows but this is just speculation  I have to see what the charts build and it will tell me everything I need to know to make 2016 a success 

A good strong bounce for SPY here but we need to close above todays close at 185 65 for this bounce to get going 
Resistance above is 187 50 then 190 and then 192 50 then 195 so let s just see if this attempt at a bounce can beat out the sellers or not 
I m medium size in my positions and ready to exit if need be  or if this bounce continues I may add or try a few other stocks 
All I can do it keep losses small and let winners run 
I bought 10  into SPY at 185 77 and I ll look to cost and perhaps 185 23 as stop levels now ",2016-01-21,Warren Bevan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-real-bounce-380933,380933
109137,330652,BKNG,Daily MACDs Just Too Strong For Now  Rates Falling,opinion,"The bear market almost took another turn down today as the S P 500 threatened to blow through the last gap up at 1869  but after coming within three points the bulls kicked it in to high gear and blasted the market higher  There have been quite a few tests of this last gap up on the S P 500 that remains open  but the bulls have taken over the market once the bears get close  The move down off the top needs more unwinding upward on those MACDs  before trying lower over time allowing for an eventual test of 1812  but that will take quite a bit of time from here  The MACDs over the past two days showed no inclination to trend lower as price dove down on those key  daily index charts  I don t know that the MACDs have to get back to zero  but they are still quite compressed lower  thus  more up time seems right  even if it s nothing on the dramatic side of the ledger  It is possible for the S P 500 to still get to the 50 day  exponential moving average at 1970  while the Nasdaq lags  but clears the 20 s  and falls short of the 50 s 
Today s action away from the Nasdaq was simply fantastic for the bulls  The MACDs were pointing higher while the market fell  but once the market reversed  they did move higher  which is a positive sign for the market very short term  The Nasdaq lagged badly today with a close well below the open  but some beaten up areas  such as the biotech stocks put in great bottoming reversals that are hard to trust  but they did reverse at new lows with some oscillators diverging positive  It s their chance to bounce and lead up a bit  but I wouldn t count on anything for certain  The charts are saying higher  but we shall see  A gap up that holds in the mornings first candle stick would be encouraging  The market isn t happy big picture  but should be opening up a small window of upside action  Let s see if the bulls can take today s candle sticks and run with them a bit 
The Nasdaq is lagging quite a bit these days  and that s due mostly to the old leaders starting to show their very first cracks  Some have fallen apart such as Priceline Inc   O PCLN   Amazon com Inc   O AMZN   and LinkedIn Corporation  N LNKD   while others are showing the very first signs of trouble  That would be from Facebook  Inc   O FB  and Google Inc  O GOOGL   O GOOG   Still strong overall but showing some cracks  The thirst for higher P E and higher beta stocks just isn t there for now  That s the world of the Nasdaq  The market is more interested in the safety trade or the world of the Dow and the S P 500  With the bull bear spread still minus  folks appear to be very fearful of a turn lower 
These folks also know that the market is taking down the Nasdaq stocks with ferocity  They re staying out of the way and running to those lower P E  higher dividend stocks  The one area of lower P E s not getting any love is the banks  This is a real concern  The reason is simple  The action in this sector is similar to how they acted in 2007  which was the prelude to a very nasty bear market  No one wants the banks  and with rates dropping  see the CBOE Interest Rate 10 Year T No   TNX   the market is no longer enamored with this group  If the banks stay depressed  the market is likely to as well  except for the usual bounces  Banks need to find a reason to rally hard if the market is to have any chance of getting out of its current down trend  If the banks can t get going on any market rally the rally is doomed to fail before being able to clear any key levels of resistance  No matter what we trend very short term  the Nasdaq should lag other than the occasional one day of out performance from being too oversold 
A quick note on sentiment  The bull bear spread came in at  4 1  today  Still in the red  which is a bit surprising to see  With Friday of last week being quite strong  I thought we d see a number at the zero line or possibly a bit positive  Fewer and fewer folks are trusting moves higher  Fewer are getting bullish now on rally attempts  and that s a major change from what we saw one year ago  An amazing loss of market trust  No shock since the market hasn t been good for over a year now  even though the losses are still quite minimal  With the S P 500 only down 11  off the all time highs  it is amazing to see the bull bear spread in minus territory since it was less than a year ago we saw readings of  40  
Fear comes in very quickly  Always fun and interesting to watch human emotion in action  For now  the numbers are a bit market favorable  but not a reason to go long in an overall  down trending market with any force  A drop of longs or shorts is fine  but careful getting too aggressive  even with fear still ruling the roost ",2016-02-04,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/daily-macd’s-just-too-strong-for-now....rates-falling...sentiment-still-383139,383139

Last year Expedia  O EXPE  improved earnings thanks to continued acquisitions  and consolidation in the industry
Expedia s international segment has not been hit as hard as its contemporaries

The core retail sales  excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food  rose 0 6  in January  As private consumption accounts for 2 3 of the US GDP  several investment banks have revised up its growth outlook for Q1  For instance  Morgan Stanley  N MS  bank has revised up the estimate from 1 2  to 1 5   This week the core economic data will come out on Friday   the US January inflation  In the absence of significant data the uptrend in the stock markets may persist  Note  that shares prices may depend on the Priceline com  O PCLN  and Wal Mart  N WMT  retailers  financial statements to be released on Wednesday and Thursday  respectively 

On the daily chart  S P 500  D1 is in downtrend and is struggling to break out of the triangle to head upwards  In such a case the double bottom chart pattern may be formed like in August September last year  Now the MACD and Parabolic indicators still give sell signals  RSI is neutral and near 50  It has formed the positive divergence  The Bollinger bands have contracted  which means lower volatility 
The trend reversal and bullish momentum may take place in case S P 500 surpasses the last fractal high  the Bollinger band and the Parabolic signal at 1947  This level may serve the point of entry  The initial risk limit may be placed below the Parabolic signal and the last fractal low at 1807 
Having opened the pending order we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Parabolic and Bollinger signals  Thus  we are changing the probable profit loss ratio to the breakeven point  The most risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop loss level at 1807 without reaching the order at 1947  we recommend cancelling the position  the market sustains internal changes which were not taken into account

109162,330677,BKNG,Forget Priceline  Grab These 3 Momentum Stocks,opinion,"Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  has charmed us for a long time  guiding conservatively and consistently beating estimates quarter upon quarter  As a result  investors piled on  sending prices higher and higher  In fact  in the month before its first quarter earnings announcement  share prices rode up close to 9     not a mean feat for a stock that trades at over a thousand bucks 
So what changed  At the risk of beating a dead horse  we have to say it was the stronger dollar  Quite honestly  Priceline did everything the way it always has  ex FX international bookings growth of 29  is nothing to scoff at  and it also beat estimates for the quarter  But management could no longer explain away the fact that they didn t hedge the FX risk 
The best way to do that would have been through strong growth in outbound travel from the U S   which has gotten cheaper due to the currency effect  But this didn t happen and the sluggish domestic business couldn t be ignored any longer 
So shares lost momentum right away  earning Priceline a Zacks Momentum Style Score of  F  
So What s a Momentum Style Score 
As evident from the Priceline story  stocks can take a sudden turn for the good  or bad   making stock picking a risky game  Every good stock also has its bad day  which further adds to the risk  At the same time  this volatility can be exploited to make significant profits  which is where the Momentum Style Score enters the picture 
The Momentum Style Score is an indication of the time to buy a stock to benefit from rising share prices  The highest score is an A  so getting in on an A and out on a B or C could be a strategy for short term gains  For a more in depth understanding  check out our  
But investors should bear in mind that this is a speculative strategy and not meant for the weak of heart 
That said  we pair the momentum score with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   which as you know indicates stocks with high chances of outperforming the market over the next 1 3 months  One of the main factors driving the Zacks Rank is estimate revisions  so stocks with high ranks as well as high momentum scores have even greater chances of short term appreciation 
Here  we ve picked out a few stocks based primarily on these two factors 
Ctrip com International Ltd   NASDAQ CTRP 
Chinese travel company Ctrip offers hotel accommodations  airline tickets and package tours  The company s brand value has increased in recent years as it tapped into the growing middle class to sell leisure travel  It also caters to business customers 
Ctrip has a Zacks Rank  2 and a Momentum Style Score  A   The company has been topping expectations in recent history with the last four quarters averaging 19 3   What s more  estimates for 2015 and 2016 have jumped a respective 136 4  and 30 3  in the last seven days 
The shares jumped 13  over the past month  10   in the last five days following better than expected results  
Stamps com  NASDAQ STMP 
The company operates an online mailing and shipping business across the U S  It helps individuals  and small and medium businesses select carriers  print shipping labels  schedule pickup  track packages and manage and account for shipping costs 
Stamps com has a Zacks Rank  2 and Momentum Style Score  A   The company has consistently topped estimates with the last four quarters averaging 35 2   Moreover  2015 and 2016 estimates are trending up 
Shares are up 23  in the last three months  The first driver was its acquisition of Newell Rubbermaid  NYSE NWL  subsidiary Endicia  which offers high volume shipping technologies for the U S  Postal service at March end  The second driver was strong earnings results in May 
Blue Nile Inc   NASDAQ NILE 
Blue Nile is the leading seller of online diamonds and jewelry made out of precious metals  gems  diamonds and pearls  The company s website includes independently certified diamonds and jewelry 
Blue Nile also carries a Zacks Rank  2 and Momentum Style Score  A   Its estimate surprise history hasn t been too great although in the last quarter it beat by a strong 25 0   Earnings estimates are edging up

Next Week s Outlook 
Stocks plunged on Thursday following a record breaking run of gains  For most of the week and even earlier  markets were buoyed by hopes of further government measures to boost the economy  The decision to allow cross border sales and optimism about further steps to be taken by the government to boost the economy were largely responsible for the benchmark s record breaking gains 
But the dramatic plunge on Thursday indicates that further monetary stimulus may not be forthcoming  The prospect of further reductions in the reverse repo rate now seems dim  This effect of this move was compounded by restrictions on lending by brokerages and resulted in severe losses 
Crucial economic reports on manufacturing and services are lined up for release next week  It is likely that the nature of this data  along with further moves by the central bank will guide markets going forward  Any announcements to boost the economy by the government will go a long way in helping stocks return to their winning ways ",2015-05-29,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-stock-roundup:-ctrip-buys-elong-stake,-trina-solar-beats-estimates-253331",253331

Investors will also be interested in gaining more information with respect to management s decision to invest circa  250M in a Chinese Travel Portal called Ctrip com International Ltd  NASDAQ CTRP   Priceline engaged in the buying of convertible bonds and if triggered  would give Priceline more than a 10  stake in the firm  This initiative by management is likely to pay dividends in the future as the strategy attempts to further diversify Priceline s revenue streams and increase its exposure to a rising U S  dollar  Priceline has made it clear to the market that they have every intention of making the most out of emerging economies in the future  With a rising consumer class in Asia and in particular China  Priceline stands to benefit from increasing demand as more and more individuals in those regions begin to travel internationally 
The report for Priceline will be crucial this morning  With the stock trading sideways since the company s FQ1  15 release  the market is looking for a catalyst to send the stock in either direction  Given management s track record of overachieving guidance and expectations  the market is likely to be expecting a beat tomorrow morning  The big question for investors is whether or not management can deliver on its global strategy or not  Competitors to date have struggled in their expansions and some nervousness around Priceline s ability to buck the trend still exists  In reality  if Priceline can in fact continue to successfully expand its operations and offering into growing international markets  the long term outlook for Priceline looks strong  Investors are encouraged to take a long term view when deciding whether or not Priceline is a good investment and should focus on the fundamentals of the company and also the travel industry as a whole ",2015-08-05,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-priceline’s-big-move-into-china-pay-dividends-260560,260560
109166,330681,BKNG,Might Be Time To Put Some Money Into The Banking Sector,opinion," A sign on the door of Opportunity reads Push  

 Anonymous
The financial sector has pulled back nicely during the market sell off in August  setting up a nice opportunity for the contrarian player  The masses are fixating on whether or not the Fed will raise interest rates by a minuscule 0 25   While they fixate on this issue  opportunity could be at hand  now might be the time to put some money into banks  One simple way to achieve this would be via KBW Nasdaq Bank Index  BKN  
A number of analysts are comparing the fact that Citibank  N C  and Deutsche Bank  N DB  are still trading well below their pre 2008 highs  as a sign that the markets are going to crash and burn  They are trading below their 2008 highs  that part is true  The same argument could have made for the NASDAQ  but it did eventually test its old highs  even though it took a long time to do so  If you look at a long term chart from 1999 to present  the trend was generally up after the correction ended in 2003  Now you could have moaned and groaned as the NASDAQ trended higher  stating that this was not a valid rally as the index was trading well off its highs  Misery and loss of profit would have been your only rewards  Many stocks such as O PCLN  O AMZN  etc  raced to all time new highs even when the NASDAQ was slowly meandering upwards to eventually challenge its all time highs of 2000  The point we are trying to make is that naysayers will always find something to scream about  It does not mean that prudence is not warranted from time to time  It just means that you should never become one with fear  
A look at the banking index shows that it is consolidating  and as long as it does not trade below 65 00 on a monthly basis  the outlook will remain bullish  There is overhead resistance at 74 50  and it will take a weekly close above this level to suggest a move to the 80 ranges is underway  If it is going to trade any higher  a monthly close above 81 will be required  If it achieves this  it will be on its way to put in a series of new highs  
This 10 year chart illustrates how much the banking index has recovered from the mortgage crisis  Many might look at the chart and state   well  it s still trading significantly below its all time highs   so the outlook must be downright negative  These individuals conveniently forget to take into consideration just how long it took for the index or market to reach that point in the first place  If you look at things from this perspective  then every correction would have to be viewed through a negative lens  For a brief period of time  the pattern would not look great  For example  you could make the same argument by looking at a market over a very short term time frame  such as 60 minutes  or even a one minute chart  etc  On a 60 minute chart  a market that looks bullish on one year chart could look like it was crashing because  on the 60 minute chart  the pattern is completely different  You have mini corrections and rallies occurring all the time  and even more so if you move to a one minute chart  you would see crashes and strong rallies taking place on a much faster scale  Thus  at any given point  the market could appear to be rallying or crashing  The time scale could distort your view  one person could walk away with the feeling that the market was in bullish phase while the other would feel certain that the markets were in a bearish phase  The time scale in this instance could push one towards forming the wrong conclusion  Instead of looking at how far a market has to rally to catch up to its old highs  why not look at how far it has already traded  The importance should always be on the now  the now is all you control  the second before is gone and unchangeable  the second to come is beyond your reach     So what s next 
Unless the index closes below 45 on a monthly basis  there is nothing to worry about  The index is topping because it has run into strong zones of resistance established in 2008  former support now turned to resistance   these levels held for so long  one should expect a market to pull back on a test of these levels  Ideally  the index would pull back to the 60 ranges  knocking out the weak players in the process and paving the way for the next leg up  A monthly close over 83 should set the path for a test of 105 107 ranges  The following stocks are the strongest in the regional banking sector  so you could consider opening positions in them  N PNC  N BKU  N STI and N JPM",2015-10-20,Sol Palha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/banking-sector-now-looking-in-the-money-268718,268718

109187,330702,BKNG,5 Stocks To Watch This Week  FOSL  ANGI  PCLN  WMT  DE,opinion,"Fossil   Tuesday
Luxury brand and watchmaker Fossil  NASDAQ FOSL  is set to report its holiday quarter earnings on Tuesday after the close  Shares of Fossil got a boost in November when the company blew fall expectations out of the water  In the third period of 2014 Fossil reported earnings of  1 96 per share and revenue of  894 5 million  Contributing analysts on Estimize had only predicted EPS of  1 84 and sales of  882 9 million 
On Tuesday Fossil is expected to report hearty growth and reveal a 16  increase to year over year earnings  Revenue is expected to rise by 7  to  1 132 billion 

Fossil s growth has largely been propelled by double digit gains in watches  its largest segment by far  Last quarter Fossil s net sales of watches increased 12  
Like many other multinational companies  currency headwinds are the risk factor to keep an eye on  In the third quarter total net comparable sales dropped slightly  They were dragged down by a decline in North America  but partially offset by gains in Europe and Asia Pacific  Relative strength in international sales compared to domestic could cause profit trimming due to the high value of the US dollar 
Angie s List   Wednesday
Angie s List  NASDAQ ANGI  stock has been trending lower since the mid part of 2013  Shares are now valued around  5 00  just 20  of what they were worth 18 months ago  Over the past 2 years the subscription based business reviews site has posted great but rapidly declining rates of revenue growth  Meanwhile the company has struggled to turn an annual profit  Contributors on  expect Angie s List to miss the Wall Street consensus by 1 cent per share on Wednesday bringing 2014 to a yearly loss of 23 cents per share 
Angie s List  by smaller more focused reviews sites and assaulted by free online directory competitors  most notably Yelp  Pressure from competitors with alternative business models has challenged Angie s List s opportunity to turn profits  This quarter contributing analysts on Estimize are setting the bar low  expecting Angie s list to miss the Street s consensus by 1 cent per share on the bottom line and come in slightly below on revenue 
Priceline com   Thursday

In the second and third quarters of 2014 Priceline saw its EPS increase by 29  and 28  respectively  Over that same period revenue climbed 26  and 25   Thursday Estimize contributors predict that Priceline will outperform the Wall Street consensus but top and bottom line growth rates will drop to 2 year lows  Year over year revenue gains are expected to drop to 16  and sales are projected to increase 19  
Walmart   Thursday
Giant discount retailer Walmart  NYSE WMT   will also release earnings on Thursday  Walmart s earnings are expected to take a hit because of international currency headwinds  Revenues are projected to continue growing 

The Estimize community is forecasting a 2  drop in EPS and a 2  boost in revenues this quarter  Critics have pointed to consistently declining foot traffic as a sign of weakness  It s true that fewer customers have been entering Walmart stores  but the company s e commerce sales are booming  Last quarter Walmart reported a 21  increase in online sales on a constant currency basis  Currency headwinds and the thinner margins associated with e commerce could limit earnings growth while revenue climbs this period 
Deere   Friday

Marriott reported 4th quarter financial results after the closing bell Wednesday  Marriott s profits came in at 68 cents per share  well above investors  expectations  The hotel company s guidance from the prior quarter suggested that EPS would fall between 62 cents and 66 cents 
Wall Street had come to a consensus expectation that Marriott would report 65 cents in earnings per share  Contributing analysts on Estimize were slightly more optimistic  forecasting 66 cents 

Marriott s 39  year over year increase in earnings per share was driven by 11  revenue growth and an aggressive stock buyback program  In 2015 Marriott spent  1 5 billion to repurchase 24 2 million of its own shares  7 7 million of those shares were bought back in the holiday quarter for  544 million 
Stock buyback programs have become a popular way for companies to boost earnings without requiring much revenue growth  Here Marriott s 11  sales increase is a 5th quarter high

Technically  Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN   can be viewed as a massively wide bull flag after a run higher from the 650 area  That would target 1700  Probably not Thursday  But the price action is positive short term  A higher high this week gives a target on a Measured Move to 1380  The RSI is rising and the MACD is going up as well  There is support lower at 1250 and 1220 followed by 1180 and 1130  There is resistance higher at 1315 and 1375 before free air

But with the options market closed it is time to look at what to do as the price reacts to the report Thursday morning  With the chart above as a guide the long term view looks best to the upside  provided any pullback does not break below the yellow rectangle  A short pullback can be viewed as a technical buying opportunity  Personally I would wait a few days to see if you can get the stock even lower if that is the case  But with the implied volatility wrenched out of the options by mid day a buy with an options hedge should be all right as well  Just not below the yellow box

Another day  another failure  but you are all used to that by now  Right  Hello  Look folks  we ve seen this so many times over the past five months it shouldn t have a single adverse effect on you  Wash  rinse and repeat for so long it s off the charts  That said  we need to study how the market sold off today and ask ourselves if the selling that took place below the breakout level of 2119 to  let s call it  2125 was really bearish  I would suggest it was not  The volume was light and the oscillators were leading  while price fell very little  meaning solid unwinding without a lot of price depreciation  It would be very bad for the bulls if price was leading lower with force while the oscillators stayed up there  No longer are we overbought  and no one should feel as if today s selling was anything bad in terms of price We were simply too overbought coming in to the day s trading and needed to fall and unwind the right way  and that s what we did  Nothing bearish to be found  but that doesn t mean the market has to break out  Nothing is coming easily for the bulls  and clearly not so for the bears as we sit in the land of whipsaw to nowhere big picture  Short term we get a lot of head fakes  but in the end nothing of significance  It feels significant as we get close on both sides but in the end nothing of significance has occurred in nearly half a year  Choppy and boring  I think  would best describe it  So yes  we failed today  but it wasn t the type of failure that should completely deflate the hopes of the bulls  That s for another day  Well  maybe  We can laugh at it all by now  can t we  I hope so  The bulls have hope  We shall see It is too easy to get caught up in this market so I think there are a few ways to play if you must participate all the time or at least most of the time  Many of you come to the casino every day with the prospect of playing   Why else be here   is often the attitude  I get it  I don t agree with it  but I definitely get it emotionally  So  if you re going to play  try playing when the short term oscillators have unwound to close or at oversold conditions  If the market breaks out first then wait for the back test from overbought  Those are the two choices That said  with the constant failures off the top  you can find plenty of times to get in near oversold oscillators  Try not to chase strength  especially if that strength is occurring below the breakout level  The closer the breakout and the more you re overbought the more you should be thinking about cash  but  of course  do what feels right to you  I m not saying buying strength can t work  It can  but the odds are clearly lower if you re playing that way over the past many  many months  Patience in an inpatient game is not an easy practice but if you can t practice it well you re probably practising being very frustrated and disappointed The market is still playing the game of rotation even though more and more big players are falling down in to either corrections of bear markets  We ve lost so many and are losing more all the time  Leaders  such as LinkedIn Corporation  NYSE LNKD   Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN   Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   and many others are struggling instead of leading  but for now the financial stocks are holding up  Overbought  but holding up overall  Money in droves is still not leaving the market  When rotation stops we re in trouble from a bullish perspective  but  for now  that is occurring  You know the story  It s old and boring Let s start with a close over 2119  and then over 2125  Do it with force and we re in business for the next breakout  If we lose 2045 we re headed lower in all likelihood  Sadly  the one day at a time environment is still with us  Adapt or find trouble  It s your call ",2015-05-12,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/another-try...another-failure.....but-not-bearish..-251392,251392

With more than 80  of Q3 results already on the books  the picture emerging from this reporting cycle is decent enough  it s not great  but it s not bad either  In terms of growth rates  beat ratios and guidance  it s a mixed bag when Q3 results are viewed in the context of other recent periods  Some metrics are showing an improvement  such as a modestly bigger ratio of companies is beating earnings estimates and the revenue growth rate appears to have picked up  But other metrics are showing weakness  such as the relatively lower earnings growth rate and the fewer positive revenue surprises  The guidance picture is no different from what we have been seeing in recent quarters  with a majority of the companies providing guidance guiding lower  with Michael Kors  NYSE KORS   Priceline  NASDAQ PCLN  and Este Lauder  NYSE EL  as the latest in a long line of leading operators providing weak outlook  As a result  estimates for the current quarter  2014 Q4  are following the all too familiar pattern of sliding down  as the chart below clearly shows 

In some aspects  the negative revisions trend for the current quarter is somewhat more pronounced than what we had seen at a comparable stage in the preceding reporting cycle   More on that on page 10 Q3 Earnings Scorecard  as of November 5th  2014  Including this morning s earnings announcements  we now have Q3 results from 414 S P 500 members that combined account for 86 7  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these 414 companies are up  7 4  from the same period last year on  3 9  higher revenues  with 72 9  beating EPS estimates and 56 3  coming out with positive revenue surprises  The two charts below compare the Q3 growth rates and beat ratios for these 414 companies with what these same companies reported in 2014 Q2 and the 4 quarter average  through Q2  

As you can see  the earnings and revenue growth performance for these 414 companies   7 4  for earnings and  3 9  for revenues  are below what we got from these same companies in Q2  but compare favorably to the respective 4 quarter averages  With respect to surprises  the earnings and revenue beat ratios are following divergent paths  with earnings surprises notably more widespread while revenue surprises a little hard to come by  Looking at Q3 expectations as a whole  combining the actual results from the 414 S P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the remaining 86  total earnings are expected to be up  6 3  on  3 7  higher revenues  The composite growth has started going up as more companies report and beat estimates  The overall level of total earnings in Q3 are on track to be the second highest ever  second only to the record level of the preceding quarter   2014 Q2

109234,330749,BKNG,Retracement Is Due  And Charts Look Lower,opinion," If you can find a path with no obstacles  it probably doesn t lead anywhere     Frank A  Clark
Yesterday  was a relatively quite day until the last half an hour when markets and stocks finally began to show some weakness 
With the amazing strength we saw early this week some retracement is due and still charts do look lower over the next couple of weeks or so till the next major move 
I m still playing very small in this market but we did try some PCLN and GOOGL shorts today using options and I was stopped out for about a  400 loss on PCLN but we are up nearly  1100 in GOOGL so I sold about half my position and am letting the rest ride 
Trading is always about making more than you lose and everyone loses sometimes 

SPY is rolling over from the top end of this triangle  Looks like we should move down to the 200 area now before perhaps a break lower towards 190  I still have some weekly SPY puts from Monday that are well underwater but they could come back and be profitable shortly Still  it is embarrassing how I totally ignored my stop levels in the SPY trade after harping on about tight stops  I m not perfect unfortunately but it isn t often this error happens ",2015-02-05,Warren Bevan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reversing-off-range-240935,240935

A pretty quiet Friday all in all as we continue to consolidate recent gains 
Really great action for the most part that will lead us nicely to the upside again and by mid week or so we should get some new buy levels appear 
We didn t do much Friday but I did add to Clovis Oncology  NASDAQ CLVS  and also tried a bounce trade in Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  that showed me a small loss so I was out 
Let s move right to the charts 

SPY is so far holding the 193 level I talked about but I think a little more downside looks to be in order 
192 would be a nice level to test but if that fails then we should probably move back to fill the gap near 190 and that would be fine as well 
This is a good example of what I mean when I talk about the great swing trading environment we are in at the moment 
We saw a nice breakout in SPY at 190  then 193 and then hit the 196 level I ve talked about  before reversing 
Had you held you d just be giving up recent gains so why not book gains once we reverse from a resistance level and then reload as we move off support

109266,330781,BKNG,What OpenTable Acquisition Means For Yelp  GrubHub,opinion,"Last Friday shares of Yelp  NYSE YELP  and GrubHub  NYSE GRUB  took off as Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  announced a deal worth  2 6 billion to acquire online restaurant reservation platform OpenTable  NASDAQ OPEN   Yelp stock rose 14  on Friday and GrubHub shares gained 7  after Priceline agreed to pay a 47  premium on top of OpenTable s market capitalization  Yelp is the most widely predicted takeover target on the crowdsourced M A predictions platform Mergerize com  and last week s news has investors betting that an acquisition might be in the near future for Yelp as well 

Yelp s stock hasn t performed particularly well in 2014 as the company was adversely affected by the rotation from high momentum growth names to more stable and larger companies  The swing was especially brutal between March and April when Yelp shares tumbled from a high of  101 75 to  54 68 for a loss of nearly 50  

Although Yelp has struggled with profitability over the past 2 years and has failed to post positive earnings in any single quarter  the company s revenue has been increasing steadily  In March the broad selloff targeted stocks with high  or negative  price to earnings ratios like Yelp  but consistent revenue growth and the promotion of their 2013 acquisition  SeatMe  leaves plenty of upside in play for Yelp 

SeatMe is a online and mobile reservation app designed to go toe to toe with OpenTable  which currently dominates the market  Yelp offers similar user generated content  ratings and reviews  compared to OpenTable  but its SeatMe app its poised to become a much cheaper alternative for restaurants to fill available seats than OpenTable  On average OpenTable s combined monthly subscription and per reservation charges add up to a  697 monthly bill to restaurants using the service  Comparatively  SeatMe offers a similar service for only  99 per month  with no additional variable costs 
For obvious reasons  SeatMe could quickly become a thorn in OpenTable s side if the platform can gain some traction among diners  The only potential roadblock here is the first mover advantage that OpenTable has  OpenTable already has table hunters on its platform which it offers to users for free  But it s not an impossible problem for Yelp to solve  
Yelp has become one of the most well known and trusted mobile and desktop app for restaurant reviews  Many OpenTable users go on Yelp first to find which restaurant they would like to eat at before switching back over to OpenTable to book a reservation  Yelp is already dangling its reservation app on its review pages  with more promotion SeatMe may be able to cut OpenTable out of the reservation booking process completely and gain adoption from restaurants and users alike  

GrubHub recently had its IPO and unveiled fundamental financial information to investors  GrubHub  which merged with Seamless in 2013  offers online and mobile apps where customers can order and pay for online restaurant deliveries  Like Yelp and OpenTable  much of the value of GrubHub comes from its user generated ratings and reviews  The large premium that Priceline paid to acquire OpenTable is a sign that companies are placing a ton of value in community assets that generate their own content 
GrubHub has its own restaurant ratings and reviews  but the company is still somewhat vulnerable to Yelp in a similar fashion to OpenTable  The advantage that GrubHub has over OpenTable is that its platform carries a lower risk of being copied  Reservation search and booking isn t too complicated of a process  There are only 3 variables involved  the name of the restaurant  party size  and the desired time of the reservation  The real differentiators for reservation booking apps are the quantity and quality of content  and the price point for restaurants  two areas where Yelp may have a leg up on OpenTable  On the other hand  building a platform where restaurants can create their own clickable and customizable online menus including a mobile payments system is a much more difficult undertaking  and that offers some hope of protection for GrubHub  

Although GrubHub s revenue has more than doubled on a year over year basis in each of the previous 2 quarters  Yelp is the king of content and the food tech company getting all the attention in the rumor mill  On Mergerize 14 predictions have been made that Yelp will be acquired within 1 year  The mostly commonly predicted acquirer is Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO  with 7 analysts believing Yahoo  will look to acquire Yelp after its windfall from the Alibaba IPO  The average predicted takeover price on Mergerize is  7 81B  and the news of the OpenTable deal just increased Yelp s market capitalization by over  750M to  5 34B  If Yelp were to be acquired today for the same 47  premium that Priceline paid for OpenTable  the sale price would be around  7 85B  Maybe there is some wisdom in the crowd for M A after all ",2014-06-18,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-opentable-acquisition-means-for-yelp,-grubhub-216573",216573
109267,330782,BKNG,Priceline s Long Term Rising Wedge,opinion,"Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  Confirmed a Price Channel Then Broke Out of it This Morning on the BOJ Yen Meltdown 
PCLN had confirmed a new price channel  then broke out of it this morning on the yen meltdown 
A price channel breakout would usually retest the top of the old channel   That retest establishes the new steeper channel  as drawn on chart  
Because of the point PCLN was in within its blue channel  the breakout move can either be the start of a topping pattern  green scenario  or a lead in to a move further up the channel 
These short term moves are occurring with a long term rising megaphone that broke out the top and has been making big volatile moves since   These moves are consistent with the formation of a major top 

PCLN Long Term Rising Megaphone
Usually a long term rising megaphone formation would have a VWAP up near where a move to the megaphone bottom would be a retest of VWAP  But in PCLN s case  the VWAP of the rising megaphone is far below 
That means that after PCLN tops  it s headed for a breakout from the rising megaphone to get to that retest of VWAP 
Sometimes a price won t get all the way to a VWAP that far down  Instead  you ll see it start a sideways move roughly 2 3 of the way to the VWAP  But in those cases  the price will usually be stuck in a relatively small trading range for a very long time  years    long enough to move the VWAP up to that level 
Where the short term chart and long term chart intersect is that PCLN price channels may have it starting a short term top right now   If that is the case  that top will be forming across the topping formation VWAP  horizontal pink line on chart  
A downward breakout from a topping formation at that VWAP targets at least the bottom of the long term rising megaphone  and likely a big breakout through it ",2014-11-02,Trader Moe,https://www.investing.com/analysis/priceline's-long-term-rising-wedge-231040,231040
109289,330804,BKNG,What To Make Of Google s Hotel Move,opinion,"Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL  has set its sights on the hotel listing industry  Google announced earlier this week that it will be adding more pictures and reviews to its hotel listings  What exactly does this mean 
Google has become a sort of tech ETF  Over the past decade Google has expanded out from their search business into a variety of other verticals including email  cloud data storage  maps  web analytics  wearable technology  driverless cars  and a zillion other secret projects they are working on in unmarked warehouses out in Silicon Valley 
The company s latest announcement to get into the hotel listings industry takes them back to what they do best  data and search 
Some of the biggest advertisers on Google might be uneasy about the announcement  Online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline com Incorporated  NASDAQ PCLN  represent a major chunk of Google s advertisement revenues  Mark Mahaney  an analyst from RBC Capital Markets  claims that despite over having 1 million ad customers Priceline and Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE  are expected to pay for over 5  of Google s ad sales this year  By convincing travelers to start their hotel search on Google Search rather than TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP   Priceline  or Expedia Google is making a powerplay against two of its biggest customers  If Google becomes the new king of hotel search  advertisements on Google Hotels will become that much more critical and online travel agencies will hand over mounds of cash for premium advertising spots 
Some suspect that Google will use its search platform to encourage hotels to advertise direct listings to potential lodgers if there is a sufficient data match  cutting out the online travel agencies completely  Everyone knows that Google has boatloads of user data  Targeted advertisements could be a compelling proposition for hotels which seek to avoid the fees from Expedia and Priceline which can be as high as 25  
The company that is most directly targeted by Google s move into hotels however is TripAdvisor  Like Google Hotels  TripAdvisor is a search platform for travelers where they can find hotel listings they can book through the online travel agencies 
Just like everything else happening in tech right now  there is strong reason to believe that Google Hotels will be focused on mobile engagement  One successful and emerging mobile hotel booking app that Google may be taking a look at is Hotel Tonight  Hotel Tonight is an Android and iOS app that launched in 2010 and has now been downloaded over 8 million times  The app is perfect for travelers on the go because it specializes in matching buyers and sellers for last minute hotel bookings  Adding this type of service on top of Google Hotel s mobile app which launched in November 2013 would put even more emphasis on Google s mobile engagement which is already quite entrenched 
So how will Google s expansion of Google Hotels effect the fundamentals of the relevant players  Off the bat it s important to note that travel and tourism within the United States is a  450 billion industry that is expected to continue expanding  The World Travel and Tourism Council suggests that the industry will grow 3 5  this year  Over the past two years earnings and revenue charts from both Priceline and Expedia look fairly attractive 

But if Google can begin to attract direct hotel advertisements or increases its position of leverage against the online travel agencies  they could be hurting  If Google can become the king of hotel search  it will increase the priority of advertising with Google which may enable Google to extract higher prices for hotel search advertisements  pressuring margins at Expedia and Priceline  The reverse point of view is that even though advertisements might become more expensive  they could also become more efficient and actually boost the business of the booking agencies  If Google s search and data team can improve the matching between travelers and targeted advertisements from the travel agencies  advertisements might become more cost effective despite becoming pricier 
The third lurking possibility  which should have the online travel agencies uneasy  is that Google may just start selling hotel advertisements directly  How do you think Google s expanded operations in hotel search will shake out  Come onto the Estimize com platform and submit estimates for Google  Expedia  Priceline  and TripAdvisor to share your opinion  Do you think Google will make an acquisition to boost Google Hotels on Mobile  Will it be Hotel Tonight  or something completely different  If you have any predictions about merger or acquisition activity within the hotel bookings space submit your guess on our M A platform  mergerize com ",2014-04-11,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-to-make-of-google’s-hotel-move-209356,209356
109290,330805,BKNG,The Earnings Expectations That Sinking Priceline com Needs ,opinion,"Priceline com  NASDAQ PCLN  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Thursday  May 8th  Priceline com is an online travel reservations website which has beaten the earnings expectations from Wall Street in each of the past 6 quarters  There are high expectations that customers booking travel plans on mobile devices will bolster Priceline com s earnings this quarter  Wall Street is looking for an increase in earnings of  1 09 per share and a 25  gain in year over year revenue  While the consensus is that robust earnings growth will be reported  the stock has not been doing so well  Here s what investors expect from Priceline on Thursday 

The information below is derived from data submitted to the  platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Priceline com to report  6 85 EPS and  1 632B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 41 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  7 15 EPS and  1 660B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Priceline com to beat EPS estimates from Wall Street by 30c per share and  28 million in revenue 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Priceline com s EPS and revenue in every single quarter  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a larger than usual differential between the EPS expectations from Estimize and Wall Street and an average differential in revenue 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  6 50 to  7 84 EPS and from  1 580B to  1 800B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a larger than usual range of estimates on Priceline com than usual 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of EPS estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter  the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from  7 26 to  6 85 while the Estimize consensus also dropped from  7 54 to  7 15  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus sank early in the period before flattening out at  1 632B while the Estimize consensus decreased from  1 730B to  1 660B   Timeliness and the directionality of analyst revisions are often a leading indicator  however the consensuses from Estimize and Wall Street are flat going into the earnings report 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is WallStreetBean who projects  7 35 EPS and  1 675B in revenue  WallStreetBean is ranked  among over 4 400 contributing analysts  This season WallStreetBean has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 55  and 53  of the time respectively throughout 58 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case WallStreetBean is making a bullish call expecting Priceline com to beat the expectations from both Wall Street and Estimize 
Despite the very high fundamental growth expectations for Priceline com the stock has been selling off alongside other web companies with high price to earnings ratios like Twitter and Amazon com  This quarter the market as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Priceline to beat the Street by 30c per share in earnings and  28 million in revenue  The earnings bar has been set high for Priceline  we ll see if they can live up to it in the morning

109317,330832,BKNG,Forecasting Future Earnings  Key To Successful Stock Investing,opinion,Putting Analysts  Estimates Into Perspective I believe that estimating future earnings growth is a major key to successful long term stock investing  If you re a true investor  then you are actually investing in the business  Consequently  the success of the business that you invest in is going to be the primary determinant of how much money you can expect to earn on that investment  Stated more directly  when you invest in a stock you are buying its future earnings potential   To my way of thinking  the only logical reason I would ever want to own any stock  business  is because I believe that the company is a profitable enterprise  But not just in the past  or the present  but most importantly in the future  After all  and as I previously stated  future profits will be the source of any long term return expectations I might have  Moreover  the growth of those profits will be a primary contributor to the total annualized return I can expect the investment to produce on my behalf   Therefore  I believe as investors  we cannot escape the obligation to forecast future earnings  because our results depend on it  Furthermore  we should not guess  nor should we simply play hunches  Instead  we must attempt to calculate reasonable probabilities based on all the factual information that we can assemble  Then we should apply analytical methods based upon our earnings driven rationale that provide us reasons to believe that the relationships producing earnings growth will persist in the future  In other words  we must strive to forecast future earnings as accurately as we possibly can  On the other hand  we should simultaneously realize that perfection is not to be expected   As an aside  there are many who criticize or even claim that we should eschew utilizing forward earnings forecasts when trying to determine fair value  or even when trying to decide what stock to own  I find these positions rather bizarre  I cannot think of any logical reason why anyone would invest in a business  unless they had a reasonable expectation of that business s ability to generate future profits  Since I am confident that both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of the company s future earnings power  estimating future earnings must be the essential element of long term success   The Selection Dilemma But here is the dilemma  With all the thousands of companies to choose from  how can I forecast future earnings accurately enough in order to pick the stocks that might best meet my goals and objectives  I believe the obvious answer is by initially relying upon the consensus estimates of leading analysts following a given company  These estimates are readily available and provided by earnings estimate aggregators such as Standard   Poor s Capital IQ  Zacks  Thomson Reuters IBES  Institutional Brokers Estimator Service  and others  Moreover  earnings estimates can be found on most major financial websites and blogs   Admittedly  consensus estimates may not be perfect  in fact  I would almost guarantee that many estimates will be wrong  On the other hand  I also believe that consensus estimates are generally accurate enough to be of value  especially for stock screening purposes  And more importantly  the closer to current time the estimate that you re relying on is  this year or next year s estimate   the more likely it is that they will be accurate enough to be of value   At this point  I am sure many readers skeptical of analysts  estimates will cite numerous studies by academics suggesting that analysts  estimates are not accurate enough to be of value  Perhaps the most famous study on the accuracy of earnings estimates is the McKinsey study  Frankly  I have read the McKinsey study  and the majority of other similar studies  and found that they provide little evidence to deter me from relying on  and benefiting from analysts  estimates   For example  one prominent study suggests that analysts  estimates are often off by factors of 12  or more  Later in this report  I will illustrate why I believe that margins of error at that magnitude are not really relevant deterrents against relying on analysts  estimates  This is especially true if forward earnings estimates are utilized and viewed correctly   Consensus Earnings Estimates Accuracy Perhaps most importantly  we must ask ourselves the question  just how accurate do analysts  estimates need to be to be of real value  I believe the answer to this important question is   within a reasonable range of probability  Since forecasting is all about the future  and much of the future is an unknown  we must accept the fact that estimates will contain a level of imprecision  Therefore  we should expect discrepancies to manifest when our forecast eventually turns to actual reality  reported earnings   Furthermore  I believe it would be na ve to expect analysts  estimates  or even consensus estimates  to be perfect  There are a lot of unknown variables in the future that could affect the ultimate results  Furthermore  many companies  especially multinationals with numerous divisions and diverse businesses  are complex enterprises with a lot of moving parts  Therefore  and once again  I believe that the best that a rational person can hope for is that estimates fall within a reasonable range of probability and accuracy   Moreover  I have always believed in running the numbers out to their logical conclusions  In other words  let s calculate and think through what an earnings miss might actually mean in numerical terms  For example  a very common miss that the media seems to take great glee and relish in reporting  is a plus or minus by a penny  In other words  XYZ Company reported earnings today that missed analysts  expectations by one cent  We ve all seen the stock price of the company reporting such a miss often fall by ridiculous percentages of 5   10   or more   However  let s do a simple calculation and apply some basic logic to what a one penny miss might actually mean  If we assume that the normal PE ratio of the average company is 15  then a company that delivered one penny less than expected should only have a market value that is   15 less than what our original estimate indicated  For a very fast growing company  let s say one growing by 20   a one penny miss might require a discount of   20  i e  PE 20 x one penny   My point being  that a one penny earnings miss does not really amount to very much in the long term scheme of things  Moreover  consider that this same math applies whether the earnings miss is plus a penny  or minus a penny   As an aside  based on my own  albeit anecdotal experience  there tend to be more earnings misses on the plus side than there are on the negative side  I believe this is because a significant portion of the ultimate estimate that an analyst makes is significantly based on guidance from the company itself  I believe that prudent  smart  management teams are more likely to guide lower and therefore exceed expectations  than the other way around  This presents the argument that relying on the forward earnings estimates of analysts may be a very conservative way to base stock investing decisions on   What If Calculations   Running The Numbers To Their Logical Conclusions Next I will run through a few sample companies with varying historical growth rates in order to illustrate the magnitude  or lack thereof  of what an earnings miss truly represents  The companies I m going to utilize in this example are only offered because they represent low growth  moderate growth and fast growth examples  To be clear  I am not recommending or building a case for investment  or against investment  in any of these samples  Instead  I am utilizing them to provide some mathematical realities of what earnings estimates are actually all about   Stryker Corp   SYK  A good example of a company with a history of beating consensus earnings estimates is Stryker Corp  The following graphics are provided courtesy of MSN Money reporting earnings estimates on Stryker provided to them by Zacks   I believe the most important benefit that earnings estimates provide is a perspective of whether a company is going to grow in the future or not  as well as an idea of what magnitude that growth may fall into  Although it would be wonderful to know precisely what that growth would be  it s more important  as I will illustrate later  that earnings actually grow rather than shrink   According to the consensus of approximately 16 to 18 analysts reporting to Zacks  the estimated earnings growth rate for Stryker over the next 5 years is 8 5   Later  I will present the consensus of 29 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ reflecting their expectation that Stryker will grow earnings over the next 5 years at 9 1  per annum    My goal is to illustrate that the 7  magnitude of difference  8 5  versus 9 1   is really not material  In other words  Stryker would be an attractive investment if either one of those milestones were achieved  Obviously  Stryker is a better investment at 9 1  growth than at 8 5  growth  However  both of these 5 year growth rates would be acceptable   At this juncture the reader might recall that I hypothesized that near earnings are likely to be more accurate  and perhaps more meaningful  than long term estimates like the five year growth rate estimates presented above  Therefore  this next graph  again provided courtesy of MSN Money based on the consensus reported by Zacks  provides closer estimates  I am focusing on fiscal year ends  December 2013 and December 2014 of  4 33 and  4 70 respectively  However  estimates are also provided for the next couple of quarters on the table under the graph   Next I m going to turn to the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator courtesy of F A S T  Graphs  to provide a second opinion  as well as the opportunity to run a few varying what if scenarios  The consensus of 29 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ expects Stryker to grow earnings at a rate of 9 1  over the next five years   Furthermore  they expect fiscal 2013 earnings of  4 33  identical to Zacks   and  4 71 for fiscal 2014 earnings  or one penny more than Zacks  Therefore  regarding the next two years  there is a high consensus among the two earnings aggregators  Zacks and Standard   Poor s Capital IQ  However  remember there is a 7  magnitude difference  9 1  is 7  higher than 8 5   between the two five year estimated earnings growth rates   When running these numbers to their logical conclusion through the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator  calculates an expected five year total annualized return  including dividends  of 8 6   per annum   However  what if Zacks  analysts were correct  and Stryker Corp only grew at 8 5   and if earnings in fiscal 2014 were only  4 70 instead of  4 71  The five year estimated total annual return only dropped to 8 2  from 8 6    Now when you consider that both of these numbers are more likely than not to be moderately imprecise  you should start getting a perspective on why estimates do not need to be exact  However  they do need to be within a reasonable range of accuracy  and frankly  they usually are   Southern Company  SO  Next  let s run a slow growth example  Southern Company  through similar what if scenarios  I will utilize the same graphs from the same sources in all following examples as I did with my first example  Zacks forecasts that Southern Company will grow earnings at 5  per annum rate over the next five years   Zacks also reports that consensus  expectations of earnings per share for fiscal 2013 and 2014 are  2 75 and  2 92 respectively   According to 15 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ the following F A S T  Graphs  Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator expresses the same 5  five year earnings growth rate but only  2 90 earnings per share for fiscal 2014  This calculates out to an expected five year annualized total return  including dividends  of 6 8   In contrast  utilizing the override feature of the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator  we discovered that calculations based on Zacks  estimates have very little effect on the estimated total annualized rate of return  In this example  the only differences are the  2 90 earnings per share estimate for 2014 by Capital IQ versus  2 92 earnings per share for 2014 by Zacks  In other words  the difference is immaterial The remaining examples  United Technologies Corp  and Priceline com Inc  run the same comparisons as previously presented based on estimates

109349,330864,BKNG,Can Expedia Replicate Outstanding 2012 Results ,opinion,Travel agencies are competing for a slice of a shrinking industry and the battle is now wagered online  where Expedia  EXPE  has established a strong foothold  While it is still trailing market leader Priceline  PCLN   the company has achieved remarkable results in 2012 and is one of the stocks that binary options traders should pay attention to  The stock has doubled its worth in a bit over a year  which explains why investors are suddenly bullish towards a company that used to fly below the radar  Is this kind of growth sustainable  Assuming that Expedia will perform at least as well in 2013  we would be tempted to believe that another doubling up is in order and there are some arguments in favor of this theory  The internet is truly the final frontier and Expedia has an outstanding business model that makes it the first choice for those who use the Internet for booking tickets  Now that they have also increased international operations  prospective customers have even more reasons to use their service  One way of replicating 2012 performance is by further consolidating its position in the OTA industry  something that Expedia diligently does  It acquires smaller companies and tries to buy its way to the European and Asian markets  where the number of international travelers has increased  While all these arguments are in favor of binary options traders willing to buy call options  there are some potential perils that need to be taken into account  What could stall Expedia stock There is one downside caused by the recent surge in stock price  as traders are now right to regard Expedia as expensive stock  It trades above the industry average and it has a low dividend yield  which makes people think twice about whether it is wise to purchase Expedia or not  The competition is increasingly intense in this industry and now that new players such as Google  GOOG  and Facebook  FB  have entered the race  it is about to be taken to a whole new level  Expedia does a great job in staying up to date with technology  but with these new players entering the game it might be very difficult to get the upper hand  Last but not least  the inability of maintaining a stable margin and the sub par revenue growth are also arguments against Expedia doubling up again  Binary options traders should trust this stock and call options still make perfect sense  but should refrain from making risky bets based on 2012 results ,2013-02-10,Martin Kay,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-expedia-replicate-outstanding-2012-results-154669,154669

109351,330866,BKNG,Forecasting Future Earnings Is The Key To Successful Stock Investing,opinion,Forecasting Future Earnings Is The Key To Successful Stock Investing  Consensus Analysts  Estimates Provide A Solid Starting PointLooking for good dividend paying stocks to add to your retirement portfolio  You might want to try trusting analysts  estimates to aid in your selection process Putting Analysts  Estimates Into PerspectiveI believe that estimating future earnings growth is a major key to successful long term stock investing  If you re a true investor  then you are actually investing in the business  Consequently  the success of the business that you invest in is going to be the primary determinant of how much money you can expect to earn on that investment  Stated more directly  when you invest in a stock you are buying its future earnings potential To my way of thinking  the only logical reason I would ever want to own any stock  business  is because I believe that the company is a profitable enterprise  But not just in the past  or the present  but most importantly in the future  After all  and as I previously stated  future profits will be the source of any long term return expectations I might have  Moreover  the growth of those profits will be a primary contributor to the total annualized return I can expect the investment to produce on my behalf Therefore  I believe as investors  we cannot escape the obligation to forecast future earnings  because our results depend on it  Furthermore  we should not guess  nor should we simply play hunches  Instead  we must attempt to calculate reasonable probabilities based on all the factual information that we can assemble  Then we should apply analytical methods based upon our earnings driven rationale that provide us reasons to believe that the relationships producing earnings growth will persist in the future  In other words  we must strive to forecast future earnings as accurately as we possibly can  On the other hand  we should simultaneously realize that perfection is not to be expected As an aside  there are many who criticize or even claim that we should eschew utilizing forward earnings forecasts when trying to determine fair value  or even when trying to decide what stock to own  I find these positions rather bizarre  I cannot think of any logical reason why anyone would invest in a business  unless they had a reasonable expectation of that business s ability to generate future profits  Since I am confident that both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of the company s future earnings power  estimating future earnings must be the essential element of long term success The Selection DilemmaBut here is the dilemma  With all the thousands of companies to choose from  how can I forecast future earnings accurately enough in order to pick the stocks that might best meet my goals and objectives  I believe the obvious answer is by initially relying upon the consensus estimates of leading analysts following a given company  These estimates are readily available and provided by earnings estimate aggregators such as Standard   Poor s Capital IQ  Zacks  Thomson Reuters IBES  Institutional Brokers Estimator Service  and others  Moreover  earnings estimates can be found on most major financial websites and blogs Admittedly  consensus estimates may not be perfect  in fact  I would almost guarantee that many estimates will be wrong  On the other hand  I also believe that consensus estimates are generally accurate enough to be of value  especially for stock screening purposes  And more importantly  the closer to current time the estimate that you re relying on is  this year or next year s estimate   the more likely it is that they will be accurate enough to be of value At this point  I am sure many readers skeptical of analysts  estimates will cite numerous studies by academics suggesting that analysts  estimates are not accurate enough to be of value  Perhaps the most famous study on the accuracy of earnings estimates is the McKinsey study  Frankly  I have read the McKinsey study  and the majority of other similar studies  and found that they provide little evidence to deter me from relying on  and benefiting from analysts  estimates For example  one prominent study suggests that analysts  estimates are often off by factors of 12  or more  Later in this report  I will illustrate why I believe that margins of error at that magnitude are not really relevant deterrents against relying on analysts  estimates  This is especially true if forward earnings estimates are utilized and viewed correctly For more color on the relevance and importance of incorporating forward earnings estimates into your investing toolbox  I refer readers to the following article written by one of my favorite financial writers  Jeff Miller Consensus Earnings Estimates AccuracyPerhaps most importantly  we must ask ourselves the question  just how accurate do analysts  estimates need to be to be of real value  I believe the answer to this important question is   within a reasonable range of probability  Since forecasting is all about the future  and much of the future is an unknown  we must accept the fact that estimates will contain a level of imprecision  Therefore  we should expect discrepancies to manifest when our forecast eventually turns to actual reality  reported earnings  Furthermore  I believe it would be na ve to expect analysts  estimates  or even consensus estimates  to be perfect  There are a lot of unknown variables in the future that could affect the ultimate results  Furthermore  many companies  especially multinationals with numerous divisions and diverse businesses  are complex enterprises with a lot of moving parts  Therefore  and once again  I believe that the best that a rational person can hope for is that estimates fall within a reasonable range of probability and accuracy Moreover  I have always believed in running the numbers out to their logical conclusions  In other words  let s calculate and think through what an earnings miss might actually mean in numerical terms  For example  a very common miss that the media seems to take great glee and relish in reporting  is a plus or minus by a penny  In other words  XYZ Company reported earnings today that missed analysts  expectations by one cent  We ve all seen the stock price of the company reporting such a miss often fall by ridiculous percentages of 5   10   or more However  let s do a simple calculation and apply some basic logic to what a one penny miss might actually mean  If we assume that the normal PE ratio of the average company is 15  then a company that delivered one penny less than expected should only have a market value that is   15 less than what our original estimate indicated  For a very fast growing company  let s say one growing by 20   a one penny miss might require a discount of   20  i e  PE 20 x one penny   My point being  that a one penny earnings miss does not really amount to very much in the long term scheme of things  Moreover  consider that this same math applies whether the earnings miss is plus a penny  or minus a penny As an aside  based on my own  albeit anecdotal experience  there tend to be more earnings misses on the plus side than there are on the negative side  I believe this is because a significant portion of the ultimate estimate that an analyst makes is significantly based on guidance from the company itself  I believe that prudent  smart  management teams are more likely to guide lower and therefore exceed expectations  than the other way around  This presents the argument that relying on the forward earnings estimates of analysts may be a very conservative way to base stock investing decisions on What If Calculations   Running The Numbers To Their Logical ConclusionsNext I will run through a few sample companies with varying historical growth rates in order to illustrate the magnitude  or lack thereof  of what an earnings miss truly represents  The companies I m going to utilize in this example are only offered because they represent low growth  moderate growth and fast growth examples  To be clear  I am not recommending or building a case for investment  or against investment  in any of these samples  Instead  I am utilizing them to provide some

109373,330888,BKNG,Priceline Com Finds Support  Baidu Breaks Out,opinion,  interesting charts are bound to appear everywhere  Priceline com  PCLN  and Baidu  BIDU  are two of many with interesting post earnings patterns  I covered the post earnings set up on priceline com  PCLN  on August 11th  see      PCLN never closed below the critical  560 support line and is now bouncing in picture perfect form  The charts below show the origin of the support line and then a close up of the recent trading action I still think that this rally will end at the looming resistance from the 200 day moving average  DMA   Then again  if the market rally continues because of expectations of an imminent recovery in Europe  then PCLN could keep zipping along to close its post earnings gap down ahead of schedule Baidu  BIDU  is even more interesting because it is already up 34  in just one month as the stock recovers from a 19 month  intraday  low  BIDU showed relative weakness as it continued to sell off past the general market s June low  Now  with the stock gapping up post earnings and following through in a convincing fashion  it is difficult to understand what fear so gripped the market about BIDU earlier BIDU broke out above its 200DMA a week and a half ago on August 6th  The stock went nowhere until today  BIDU s 2 7  gain breaks out from the mini consolidation pattern and brings fresh life to the stock s post earnings rally  Of the two stocks  BIDU holds the most bullish promise  Both stocks provide very clear stop loss points  but only PCLN becomes a short below that line   560 for PCLN  200DMA for BIDU  Be careful out there Full disclosure  no positions,2012-08-17,Dr. Duru,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/priceline.com-finds-support,-baidu-breaks-out-133274",133274
109374,330889,BKNG,Growth Stocks With Value  Part 2,opinion,Introduction In part one of this series we introduced the notion that in all markets whether bear or bull  there will always exist individual stocks that are fairly valued  overvalued or undervalued  In this same vein we argued that it s a market of stocks  not a stock market  For those who missed it  here s a link to part one  To put this into context  we are simply suggesting that the discerning investor can always find bargains if they are willing to look and do their homework  However  we should also add that bargains can come from many different types of equities  Therefore  this and the following articles in this series will look at bargains that can be found within various equity classes  In this part two  we will look for bargains in high growth stocks  Although this may be the riskiest equity asset class of all  it is also the most profitable  as long as sound and prudent investing principles are adhered to High Growth Stocks DefinedOne of my favorite quips is about Tennessee Ernie Ford leading his church s choir when he allegedly said   everyone turn to page 26 and sing along with me  but if you don t have page 26 then sing page 13 twice  because we all need to be on the same page   Therefore  as it relates to this article  in order for us all to be on the same page  we need to share a common definition of growth stocks  before a fair and impartial analysis can be conducted Consequently  for purposes of this article  we define growth stocks as follows  In order to be considered a growth stock  the company must have a history of growing their earnings in excess of 15  per annum  while simultaneously possessing a forecast expected future growth rate of at least 15  or better  For companies that possess these levels of past and future growth  we will utilize a PEG  PE equals growth rate  formula to calculate fair value  The valuation theory being applied states that companies possessing these significantly above average growth rates deserve a premium valuation over slower growing peers The premium valuation concept presented above represents one aspect of why growth stocks  under our definition  possess higher risk than blue chips  First of all  achieving these high levels of growth are not only rare  but also extremely difficult to accomplish  Consequently  it is a challenge for companies to maintain high rates of growth  and this challenge is amplified the bigger the company gets  Therefore  we offer this very important caveat  Regarding growth stocks  it is even more imperative to focus on future growth over historical growth  than it is for any other equity class There is a second factor related to the above caution and that is the importance of valuation  Typically  Mr  Market will ask the prospective investor to pay a higher valuation  PE ratio  to buy a growth stock than most other equity categories  Having to pay a higher valuation for above average growth is usually not only necessary  but also rational to a point  In fact  due to the high rates of potential growth  coupled with the power of compounding  means that above average rates of return can be achieved with growth stocks  even if you pay a little more to buy one than you should  In other words  the compounding power of rapid earnings growth can bail you out from an aggressive purchase over time On the other hand  one of the most common mistakes investors make with high growth stocks is overpaying for them  This usually occurs because of the hype that often leads to hysteria which tweaks the greed response  Companies with extremely high rates of growth can for a time attract significant investor interest leading to incredible short term momentum  Consequently  a rapidly rising stock price can excite investor greed to the point of irrational behavior  One place where this psychological response is often seen is with hot IPOs  Later in this article we will present a vivid example of how dangerous this can be High Growth Stocks In The S P 500This series of articles is oriented to dealing with the wide diversity of equity classes that make up the S P 500  Therefore  we are only going to concern ourselves with high growth stocks that are constituents of the S P 500  Of course  this also means that there are many very high growth stocks that will be excluded from this discussion  Consequently  what follows is by no means presented as a comprehensive list of high growth stocks Moreover  and most importantly  the following tables comprised of high growth stocks in the S P 500 also had to meet the hurdle of reasonable valuation  As a result  there were several S P 500 growth stocks that did not make the cut  In other words  the following tables look at S P 500 high growth stocks that appear to be at or near fair value based on expected future rates of growth  S P 500 growth stocks that we believe are overvalued were not included We have listed 17 S P 500 high growth stocks that met our criteria and we have organized them based on capitalization and earnings growth rate  Interestingly  all of the S P 500 high growth stocks that made our list are large cap companies  Our first table reports on seven companies with earnings growth rates exceeding 20  per annum  The reader should note that both the 15 year historical EPS growth rate and the estimated 5 year EPS growth rate are both in excess of 20  in table 1   Our second table covers 10 additional S P 500 growth stocks with historical and estimated growth rates in excess of 15  per annum Both of the following tables provide a summary of important fundamental measurements  The first two columns list historical earnings growth  followed by forecast EPS growth rates  The next two columns are focused on valuation by showing the historical normal PE followed by the current market PE  Then we provide debt levels and sector  followed by annualized historical performance  and finally  an estimate of future potential compounded annual rates of return   It is important to note that the reader should understand that any companies on the list with poor historical returns  highlighted in red  can be assumed attributed to beginning overvaluation   Analyzing S P 500 High growth Stocks Through The Lens Of F A S T  Graphs Next we re going to evaluate several examples from our list of S P 500 high growth stocks in value  utilizing the F A S T  Graphs  fundamentals analyzer software tool  This exercise will serve the dual purpose of allowing us to analyze the fundamental value of each company and to illustrate and elaborate on several of the points previously presented in this article  Furthermore  although we believe that the following analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the fundamentals underpinning each of these examples  additional due diligence is recommended Cognizant Technology Solutions  CTSH Cognizant Technology Solutions is a leading provider of custom information technology  consulting and business process outsourcing services  The following earnings and price correlated graph on this quality company depicts a quintessential example of a true growth stock  Not only has earnings growth averaged 38  per annum  the consistency of the growth has also been extraordinary  This rate of growth is very rare  as few companies are capable of growing this consistently fast Furthermore  notice how stock price  the black line on the graph  has closely tracked earnings  the orange line on the graph  up through calendar year 2007  but has since deviated  see red circle   This long term picture of the earnings and price relationship clearly alerts us that something has changed since 2008  The first reaction of course would be that the great recession of 2008 made an impact  However  upon further review we discover that the recession did impact stock price for sure  but we also see that earnings growth continued to advance nicely  thereby suggesting that this company was clearly recession resistant On the other hand  a glance at the bottom of the graph  see yellow highlights  shows that the earnings growth rate  although continuing to be strongly above average  had slowed down  However  thanks to the dynamic nature of the F A S T  Graphs  research tool  we can run a graph since 2008  the recession   and analyze this inflection in earnings growth and the impact it had on price and valuation  However  before we do  let s take a look at performance since calendar year 1999 in order to illustrate just how powerful a return generator that a high growth stock can be When we calculate the performance that Cognizant Technologies has produced for its shareholders since calendar year 1999  we see a stunning example of the incredible power of compounding  and the incredible economic benefit it can provide  A simple  1000 investment in Cognizant s stock on December 31  1998  and held till now would have turned a  1000 initial investment into over  54 000 today  Comparing this more than 33  per annum compounded rate of return from this S P 500 constituent to the S P 500 itself  clearly illustrates just how powerful the return that this growth stock has produced A quick glance back at the historical earnings and price correlated graphic above shows that the company was reasonably priced with a PE ratio of just under 40  or only slightly above its 38  per annum earnings growth rate on December 31  1998  Remember  the formula used to value high growth stocks is the PEG  PE equals growth rate  formula  Consequently  even though the company appears undervalued during the later years based on its historical growth which averaged 38  per annum  the compounded rate of return it provided shareholders is highly correlated to its long term earnings growth Next  and as promised  let s use the dynamic feature of F A S T  Graphs  and look at Cognizant Technologies since the beginning of calendar year 2008  the great recession   Here we discover that our research tool has recalculated the company s earnings growth rate and simultaneously provides a more recent iteration of fair valuation  Since calendar year 2008  Cognizant s earnings growth rate has fallen from averaging 38  per annum to averaging 22  per annum Nevertheless  although this is still significantly above average earnings growth  it does imply a valuation adjustment  Consequently  by applying the PEG ratio valuation because earnings growth is over 15   we see that the market has been rationally valuing the company at its adjusted growth rate since 2008  Therefore  although it is useful to see how powerful this growth stock has been since 1999  it is also both imperative and useful to evaluate it based on its more recent history  This explains why the price was not tracking its long term earnings growth rate during the latter years on the long term earnings and price correlated graphic above When we review the performance of Cognizant since calendar year 2008  and consider that it was moderately overvalued with a PE ratio above 25 relative to an earnings growth rate of 22   we continue to see evidence of the strong returns that a high growth stock can provide  Furthermore  this also illustrates that you can moderately overpay for a high growth stock  and still generate a significant long term rate of return Astute investors who purchased Cognizant on December 31  2007  would have more than doubled their money  averaging approximately a 15 7  per annum return  When you compare this to investing in the S P 500 Index  the value of owning a high growth stock bought at a reasonable valuation is vividly revealed  Remember  that even though Cognizant was moderately overvalued  the power of compounding earnings growth during and through the great recession  allowed the company to provide its shareholders very attractive and highly above average returns When we turn our attention to the future  we discover that expectations are high that Cognizant Technologies can continue to grow earnings at a very high rate of growth  The consensus of 21 analysts expect the company to continue growing at approximately 20  per annum  and therefore  the current PE ratio of 21 would imply that the company is reasonably priced based on its expected high future growth  However  the reader should remember the caveats mentioned above regarding the difficulty of achieving such a high rate of growth  Here the concept of risk versus reward comes into play Priceline Com Inc   PCLN The long term graphic on Priceline com provides a lot of lessons on investing in general  but most importantly  on investing in growth stocks specifically  Additionally  the importance of investing at sensible valuations is clearly articulated  Furthermore  we can use this example to reflect on lessons to be learned when investing in IPOs  as promised earlier in this article Priceline com went public on April Fools  Day 1999  however  investing in its initial public offering was no joking matter  From the graph below we can see that for the first month after its IPO  Priceline com s stock price almost doubled in value  However  for the next 20 months or so following its price peaking  the stock fell from a high of over  974 per share to a low of  6 38 per share  Furthermore  it should be pointed out that there were no earnings being generated by the company at this time to support its high price When you calculate Priceline com s performance since its IPO to current time  we discover how devastating overvaluation can be to long term performance  Even though the company eventually began earning money  its first earnings occurred in 2002   and even though its long term rate of earnings growth has been extraordinary  long term shareholder performance has been rather anemic  This week performance is attributed solely to its stock price being irrationally priced by the market at its IPO  With no earnings to buoy the stock price  a fundamental collapse was inevitable One of the valuable attributes of the F A S T  Graphs  research tool is the ability to go back in time and focus on historical periods in order to learn from the past  The following graphic looks at Priceline over the historical timeframe 1999 to 2003  This time period covers the company from its IPO to its first years of generating a profit  From this perspective  the collapse in stock price following the first three years or so after its IPO are easily understood and justified  In other words  hype and hysteria eventually gave out to sound fundamental value When you measure the company s price performance from its IPO in 1999 to year end 2003  we see just how devastating overvaluation can be  A  1000 investment in Priceline at its IPO would have generated a compounded 50  per annum loss on its shareholders behalf  thereby turning the original  1000 investment into a mere  35 98 The moral of this story is to not invest in IPOs no matter how enticing  think Facebook  unless the company s initial earnings support the stock price  Since the company is going to trade for a long time  the patient investor would more often than not find a more attractive and rational entry point than they typically find at the IPO  With our next look at Priceline we will show how profitable this kind of patience can be Next  let s take a look at Priceline after they became a profitable business in 2003  Here we find that earnings growth has averaged over 60  per annum  and has been extremely consistent since calendar year 2005  There are two additional things to take notice of  Number one  Mr  Market has historically priced Priceline at a premium PE in excess of 30  however  this valuation is only half its actual earnings growth rate  the blue line   normal PE   Second  we see that the company has achieved this remarkable growth without needing to take on any long term debt In contrast to investing in Priceline at its IPO  let s take a quick look at Priceline and the returns they generated for shareholders after they became a profitable enterprise in calendar year 2003  The same  1000 investment on December 31  2002 would have grown to  64 803  which translates into an exceptional compounded annual rate of return of almost 54  per annum  Furthermore  notice how this extraordinary record was achieved by shareholders without receiving even one penny in dividends  As a final statement on Priceline  we must remember that as investors we can only buy the future and not the past  Consequently  based on the fact that the consensus of 24 analysts reporting to Capital IQ expects the company to continue growing at 20  per annum  indicates that the company may be fairly priced today  However  this also means that future expectations for profit  although appearing quite attractive  will not come close to their historical average F5 Networks Inc   FFIV Our final example looks at F5 Networks Inc   a leading provider of application delivery networking technology  There are several lessons regarding investing in growth stocks that we believe this fast growing technology enabler can teach us  First of all  we see another example of the extraordinary benefit provided from investing into a company with a powerful earnings record  Additionally  this company also teaches us a thing or two about valuation  and finally provides lessons on intelligently dealing with volatility From the earnings and price correlated graphic below we see that F5 Networks has generated earnings growth averaging 29 8  since calendar year 2005  Furthermore  we can clearly see that the company s stock price  although generally tracking earnings  has experienced extreme bouts of high volatility on more than one occasion But even more importantly  we see the importance of trusting fundamentals over stock price movement  because every time stock price deviated from fair value over or under  inevitably it returns to fair value  We believe this validates our thesis that price volatility will only hurt you when you overreact to it while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge intrinsic value based on fundamentals  We believe there are two performance measurements for every stock  The first is price volatility  which can t be trusted  and the second is fundamental value  which in truth matters most  Unfortunately  most investors ignore fundamental value as they are fixated on fickle price When you look at the performance that this high growth company has generated for shareholders  we once again see a high correlation between return and earnings growth  adjusted for valuation  In other words  it is only because the company is currently trading at a discount to its historical earnings justified valuation that has caused its 20 8  compounded annual return to be less than its 29 8  earnings growth achievement  Summary And ConclusionsOur primary objective with this series of articles is to illustrate the truth that there is a lot of value in this market  With this part 2  we focused on high growth stocks that were constituents of the S P 500 that are currently trading at fair value based on their earnings potential  Although many of the stocks on our master list of 17 are currently trading at above market PE ratios  we think the valuations are justified based on the earnings power of these extraordinary growers  This teaches us a lesson that valuation is a relative concept  In other words  a company with an extraordinary potential for growth is worth more than a company with a lower potential for growth The companies that we have featured in this article appear to be attractive high growth candidates for the aggressive investor seeking maximum capital appreciation  However  this statement is based on a combination of the company s historical operating history  coupled with consensus estimates for future growth  Furthermore  because these numbers are significantly higher than average  the notion of greater risk should be kept firmly in mind  On the other hand  the old adages that no risk  no return  also come into play  The bottom line is that although we feel this is an excellent list of S P 500 constituents with high growth potential  additional due diligence is highly recommended Disclosure  Long AAPL  V  GOOG  MA   NOV at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should

109395,330910,BKNG,Kayak Software  Riding The Wave Of Interest In On Line Travel Search,opinion,Based in Norwalk  CT  Kayak Software  KYAK  scheduled an  82 million IPO with a market capitalization of  907 million  at a price range mid point of  23 50 for Friday  July 20  2012  KYAK will sell 9  on the IPO  a relatively low IPO percentage  Most recent S 1 filed  Initial S 1 filed November 17  2010  KYAK was postponed May 30  2012 KYAK is a travel search engine  For the four quarters ended March 2012 KYAK generated  245 million in revenue  and  17 5 million in after tax income  see  FINANCIALS  below  SUMMARY KYAK is a travel search engine  For the four quarters ended March 2012 KYAK generated  245 million in revenue  and  17 5 million in after tax income  see  FINANCIALS  below  A concern to investors is KYAK s reliance on the ITA contact for airline search inquires  The contract expires the end of 2013 and ITA is owned by Google  GOOG   a competitor  KYAK  however  has substantially reduced it s reliance on ITA results  For the nine months ended September 2011 ITA produced 61  of KYAK s airline search inquires  The four months ended April 2012 that percentage dropped to 39    It was smart of Kayak to postpone its IPO on May 30 for two reasons  1  KYAK Needed to get out of the way of the Facebook  FB  pricing disaster  2  The travel search group of Orbit  OWW   Trip Advisor  TRIP    Expedia  EXPE  continued to go up in the last month  As a group they are up 36  on average in the last three months  KYAK expects to ride the current wave of investor interest in travel search companies  VALUATION COMPARISON Relative to TRIP   Kayak s gross margins are similar  above 92     Kayak s is priced at a premium price to earnings multiple  52 to 34    Kayak is priced at a price to sales discount  3 7 to 9 2  CONCLUSION IPOdesktop believes that KYAK will be priced favorably for initial IPO investors  BUSINESS KAYAK s services are free for travelers  KYAK offers travel suppliers and online travel agencies  OTAs   an efficient channel to sell their products and services to a highly targeted audience focused on purchasing travel  KYAK earns revenues by sending referrals to travel suppliers and OTAs and from a variety of advertising placements on KYAK websites and mobile applications  Cofounders of Expedia  Travelocity and Orbitz started KAYAK in 2004 to take a better approach to finding travel online  KYAK SPENDS MORE ON MARKETING Notice below that KYAK spent 56  of revenue on marketing  compared to the average for Orbitz  OWW   Expedia  EPXE    Tripasvisor  TRIP  of 39  for the three months ended March  2012  As a result of spending so much on marketing  KYAK s after tax profit margin was 7  compared to TRIP s after tax profit margin of 27  for 2011  On a go forward basis is that there is room for Kayak to increase its after tax profit margins  if it can get it s per cent of revenue marketing expenses more in line with OWW  EXPE   TRIP  SLIGHT POSITIVE Concurrent Private Placement Up to  9 2 million of Class A common stock may be issued at the initial public offering price  if the initial public offering price is less than  31 09 per share  RELIANCE ON Google s ITA DECLINING ITA overall airfare query results dropped from 61  to 39  from September 2011 to April 2012  S1 filing dated November   This faring engine software directly provided approximately 61  of our overall airfare query results for the nine months ended September 30  2011  Additionally  26  of our overall airfare query results during such period were obtained from other sources which  in turn  utilized the ITA faring engine software   July 9  2012 S 1  This faring engine software directly provided approximately 39  of our overall airfare query results for the first four months of 2012  Additionally  16  of our overall airfare query results during such period were obtained from other sources which  in turn  utilized the ITA faring engine software    ITA ISSUE In July 2010  Google  GOOG  announced an agreement to acquire ITA Software  ITA licenses its airfare search and pricing software to Kayak under an agreement which expires in December 2013  With the regulatory approval of the acquisition in April 2011  Google can create its own flight search tool which enables people to find comparable flight information on the Internet without using Kayak s services  The ITA faring engine software directly provided approximately 39  of KYAK s overall airfare query results for the first four months of 2012  Additionally  16  of KYAK s overall airfare query results during such the same period were obtained from other sources which  in turn  utilized the ITA faring engine software   ITA Software   ITA SERVICES AGREEMENT On March 3  2005  KYAK entered into a Services Agreement with ITA for the licensing of airline faring engine software  The agreement was subsequently amended on July 18  2007  March 11  2008 and January 1  2009  KYAK paid ITA an initial payment of  166 666 followed by a monthly service fee based on the number of queries performed  subject to a minimum of  83 333 per month  a software maintenance and operation fee of  225 per hour and a hardware fee per month of  1 450 per dual processor server used  On March 11  2008  in addition to KYAK s arrangement with ITA  KYAK agreed to assume payment obligations of SideStep to ITA following KYAK s acquisition of SideStep  On January 1  2009  KYAK agreed to amend the fee schedule as follows  to increase the monthly service fee to a minimum of  500 000 for the period until January 1  2010  and a minimum of  583 333 per month thereafter until the aggregate payments for 2012 equal certain agreed upon amounts  following which KYAK would cease such monthly minimum payments until January 1  2013  whereupon KYAK agreed to pay a minimum monthly fee to be calculated based upon the number of queries performed in 2012  For the period from January 1  2012 through December 31  2012  KYAK had an estimated minimum commitment of  7 million related to this agreement   ALSO Google threw in a surprise with the launch of a hotel search tool called Hotel Finder  announced August 2  2011  Google s  GOOG  Hotel Finder does not use ITA s technology and is being viewed as a threat to other travel search engines such as Kayak  Priceline  PCLN   Expedia  EXPE   Tripadvisor  TRIP  and Orbitz  OWW     ONLINE TRAVEL INDUSTRY The travel industry in the U S   Europe  Latin America and Asia Pacific accounted for  910 billion in global expenditures in 2011  and is projected to increase 6  in 2012  Of this amount  approximately  284 billion  or 31   was purchased online in 2011 representing a 16  compound annual growth rate  or CAGR  between 2005 and 2011  KYAK believes that travel  with its research and information intensive nature  real time pricing  electronic fulfillment capabilities and thousands of travel options  is well suited for the online channel  Currently  online travel represents the largest category of e commerce  with total sales exceeding the combined total of electronics  books  software  appliances and collectibles  Online Travel Products The two largest categories of online travel are airline ticket sales and hotel bookings  In 2011  airline ticket sales represented 53  of total online travel purchases  followed by hotel bookings at 26   Hotel bookings are the fastest growing online travel category and are projected to grow 13  in 2012  Given the significant differentiation among hotels  travelers will typically spend considerable time online researching a hotel stay  making hotel bookings highly suitable for the online channel  Online Travel Advertising Travel represents one of the largest advertising categories  with advertisers spending  33 billion globally on travel related advertising in 2011  Of this amount  only  5 billion  or 16   was spent online with the remainder being spent primarily on traditional media  KYAK believes that travel advertising will continue to move from offline to online as travel purchases continue to move online  Online travel advertising can also be a more efficient advertising channel  because it enables advertisers to directly target individuals who are researching and planning travel  The online travel advertising market is expected to reach  9 billion by 2015  a CAGR of 14  between 2011 and 2015  CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Expedia and its affiliated brands  including Hotels com and Hotwire  together accounted for 23  of KYAK s total revenues for the three months ended March 31  2012  KYAK has separate contracts with respect to Expedia and each of its affiliated brands  each of which have varying terms and expiration dates  Orbitz and Priceline each accounted for 10  of total revenues for the three months ended March 31  2012  KYAK s contract with Orbitz expires on December 31  2013  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY KYAK has ten issued U S  patents and eleven U S  patent applications for various aspects of KYAK s technology  KYAK s patents expire at various dates between March 2021 and October 2026  COMPETITION Competition from general search engine companies could adversely affect KYAK by reducing KYAK s website traffic to KYAK s website and mobile applications and by creating a competitive product that people choose over KAYAK when searching for travel online  In addition to its acquisition of ITA  Google has launched a travel search offering that displays hotel and airfare information and rates to travelers  Moreover  Microsoft acquired one of KYAK s competitors  Farecast com  in 2008 and relaunched it as Bing Travel  a travel search engine which not only allows users to search for airfare and hotel reservations but also purports to predict the best time to purchase  These initiatives appear to represent a clear intention by Google and Microsoft to appeal more directly to travel consumers and travel suppliers by providing more specific travel related search results  which could lead to more travelers using services offered by Google or Bing instead of those offered on KYAK s websites and mobile applications  For example  Google has launched the ability for users of its website to search for hotel and airfare pricing and availability  and as Google integrates such offerings with other Google services such as Google maps and weather information  GOOG competition could reduce the number of users that visit KYAK s websites and KYAK s ability to attract advertising dollars also could be negatively impacted  According to Experian Hitwise  in September 2010  30  of KYAK s traffic to travel related websites began with Google  Google or other leading search engines could choose to direct general searches on their respective websites to their own travel search service and or materially improve search speed through hardware investments  which also could negatively impact the number of users that visit KYAKs websites and negatively affect KYAK s ability to attract advertising dollars  VENTURE CAPITAL 72  Pre IPO owned by VCs General Catalyst Partners  30  Sequoia Capital  18  Accel Funds  14  Oak
