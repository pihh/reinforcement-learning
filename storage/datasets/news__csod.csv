3819,225334,CSOD,Nasdaq Rally Likely To Continue Over Long Term  5 Top Picks,opinion,The Nasdaq Composite    one of the three major stock indexes of Wall Street    is rallying again in 2020 after finishing an impressive 2019  On Jan 8  the tech laden index closed at a fresh all time high  At this stage  the question is whether the teach heavy index can maintain its momentum Nasdaq Starts 2020 From Where it Ends 2019In line with Wall Street s dream run in 2019  the Nasdaq Composite finished a fabulous last year  rallying 35 2   This was a complete turnaround of the index after a pathetic 2018  when it plummeted 3 9   recording its worst ever yearly performance since 2008  Let us look at some major achievements of the Nasdaq Composite in 2019 In 2018  Nasdaq reached its highest level of 8 109 69 on Aug 29   But after that  the index started retreating owing to heightening trade conflict between the United States and China and an extremely hawkish Fed  The tech laden index managed to surpass that barrier only on Apr 23  2019  when it closed at 8 120 82  Notably  this was the index s first closing above 8 000   a key technical threshold   for the first time after Oct 3  2018 Since then  the Nasdaq Composite had a dream run barring some minor fluctuations  The tech laden index reached a major psychological barrier of 9 000 on Dec 27  2019  This means the index completed its journey from 8 000 to 9 000 in just eight months Moreover  the index has already comfortably crossed the 9 000 level and closed at 9 129 24 on Jan 8  In the first five trading days of this year  the index gained nearly 1 8  despite intensification of U S  Iran geopolitical tussles Major Catalysts of Nasdaq CompositeSince the Nasdaq Composite is a tech heavy index  its performance is directly related to the technology sector  Tech stocks had an impressive bull run in 2019 after a pathetic 2018 buoyed by positive developments on the trade conflict front  a dovish monetary stance adopted by the Fed and a stable U S  economy This dream run of tech stocks is likely to continue in 2020 owing to a likely interim trade deal between the United States and China by mid January  China s trade spat with the United States  its largest trading partner  resulted in significant slowdown of its economy  However  a strong Chinese economy will give U S  technology companies a solid boost as China is the largest market for high tech products On the other hand  China also plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  Rollback of some tariffs imposed by the U S  government on China will reduce input costs for high tech producers Moreover  the technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation  The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for this sector in an otherwise tough environment The last few years witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing  predictive analysis  AI  self driving vehicles  digital personal assistants and IoT  which have set the stage for robust growth  In this regard  large scale commercial deployment of 5G wireless network will boost the overall technology sector Our Top PicksConsequently  it will be prudent to invest in Nasdaq Composite stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank  We have narrowed down our search to

3822,225337,CSOD,Business services firms  shares bleed as LinkedIn  Tableau crash,news,"By Sarah McBride NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Dismal sales outlooks from marquee technology names sent shares in the enterprise sector crashing on Friday as investors questioned whether information technology managers would keep spending on their products  The uncertainty spread into the broader industry  sending the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index down 3 25 percent to 4363 144  Meanwhile  the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 29 percent to 16 204 97  Business analytics company  Tableau Software   N DATA  shed half its market value a day after cutting its full year earnings guidance to between 22 cents and 35 cents a share  around half the 57 cents analysts had expected  Tableau shares closed down 49 4 percent at  41 33  The company had cut its full year 2016 revenue forecast to  830 million to  850 million from prior guidance of  845 million to  865 million  And Tableau s fourth quarter revenue of  202 8 million only narrowly beat analyst expectations of  200 8 million    When you get a company that barely beats that has  previously  been beating by a longshot  people are going to be scratching their heads a little bit   said Brian White  analyst at Drexel Hamilton   If that guy can t show much upside  what does that mean for the rest of the sector   Tableau s results came in tandem with poor performance from business network LinkedIn  N LNKD   which shocked Wall Street with a revenue forecast that fell far short of expectations  Its shares plunged 44 percent on Friday  exacerbating the rout in business services companies   They re a proxy for enterprise spend   said Daniel Ives  an analyst at FBR  about LinkedIn  Investors wondered whether enterprise customers will be willing to splurge on trends like big data analytics and cloud computing  Those trends  hyped heavily over the years by analysts and the companies themselves  had previously driven big share price gains    If you re uncertain how much is something worth  you re going to give the lowest bargain basement price   said analyst Katherine Egbert at Piper Jaffray   Companies that sell cloud based software  meaning Internet delivered software bought on a metered basis rather than paid for upfront  also saw particularly sharp declines   Business software companies Salesforce com  N CRM  and Workday  N WDAY  fell more than 10 percent each  Salesforce s 13 6 percent drop was its worst one day loss since October 2008   Shares of  Splunk Inc   O SPLK   a data analytics software maker  closed down 23 percent at  36 23  Companies that help businesses update their information technology infrastructure also slumped  Microsoft  O MSFT  dropped 3 5 percent to  50 16  while Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  fell 6 4 percent to  502 13

3823,225338,CSOD,In cloud stock tumult  investors give valuations a reality check,news,"By Sarah McBride and Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Global economic uncertainty and worries about weak spending on information technology are forcing investors in cloud computing stocks and related enterprise companies to take a reality check  The deep selloff  sparked last week after business analytics company  Tableau Software  Inc  N DATA  gave a dismal sales outlook  has put a dent in earnings multiples of several marquee business technology names  They include Salesforce com  N CRM   Workday  N WDAY  and Splunk  O SPLK    With fourth quarter earnings reports so far a mixed bag  investors are on edge about cloud companies  which deliver software from remote servers on a metered  pay as you go basis   Shoot first  ask questions later  That s the mentality of technology investors right now   said Michael James  managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles   Any disappointment is being taken out to the woodshed   Cloud related stocks have rewarded investors handsomely in the long term  with an index of 44 cloud related stocks tracked by venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners up 84 percent over the past five years  compared with the S P 500 s rise of 49 percent  On Tuesday  enterprise technology stocks were mostly higher  with Workday flat and  Oracle Corp   N ORCL  down 1 5 percent  while Tableau and Salesforce recovered 5 percent  As the stock market moved sideways last year  once astronomical price earnings multiples trickled lower in a sign that some investors were already taking notice of levels that many consider unsustainable  But some companies  multiples remain at stratospheric levels  Salesforce com recently traded at 55 times expected adjusted earnings  while human resources cloud companies Workday and Cornerstone onDemand Inc  O CSOD  have P Es above 1 000  Instead of price to earnings ratios  another way to evaluate a company is to compare its enterprise value  which adds a company s market value to its debt and excludes cash  and compare it with its free cash flow  which measures operating cash flow minus capex  It is a gauge  essentially  of what a company needs to maintain or grow its assets   That ratio  known as enterprise value to free cash flow  helps determine whether investors are overpaying for anticipated growth  and how much a company s debt can hurt   For example  a slower growing company like Cisco Systems  O CSCO  has an EV FCF ratio of 7 3  which is a relatively typical figure  By contrast  even after its recent selloff  LinkedIn s EV FCF ratio is 62 34 and Workday s is even higher at nearly 123  Before the selloff  those figures were at 386 and 150  respectively   David Bechtel  principal at long short mutual fund advisory firm Barrow Street Advisors  has short positions in several business services companies  including LinkedIn  N LNKD   Workday   Teradata   N TDC   and Splunk   You need a lot of growth and maintenance of your high margins for that multiple to make sense   Bechtel said  referring to Workday  Those levels are  assuming so much profitable growth that it s the only way a valuation multiple like that will make sense   Monday s poor revenue forecast from IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp  O CTSH  reinforced expectations that technology spending may be broadly under pressure  not just cloud computing or cutting edge analytics  Many information technology professionals have signaled for months that they did not plan significant increases in spending this year  In research done last summer  42 percent of IT professionals expected their budgets to stay flat in 2016  according to a report from Austin based IT network Spiceworks  Global software sales fell 1 4 percent last year  according to market research firm Gartner  Much of the recent selloff can be blamed on investors who became accustomed to unsustainable double digit revenue growth from up and coming companies  said Josh Stein  a partner at DFJ Venture and who led investments in cloud enterprise companies Box  Twilio and Talkdesk   They were priced to perfection   Stein said of the cloud software companies   Some of what kept those companies  stocks aloft was interest from momentum investors and hedge funds  which had notable overweight positions in internet software and services companies  according to  Credit Suisse   VX CSGN  data  Such investors were buying those stocks through the end of 2015 as other parts of the market swooned  Other venture capitalists that have invested in cloud names warned against overselling such stocks  
 The market is revaluing everything  and throwing the winners out with the losers   said Nick Sturiale  an investor in cloud companies such as Splunk at venture firm Ignition Partners   LinkedIn  N LNKD   Tableau  Splunk  FireEye  O FEYE   these are good companies  ",2016-02-09,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/in-cloud-stock-tumult,-investors-give-valuations-a-reality-check-383958",383958

3902,225417,CSOD,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Copart  Performance Food Group  Cornerstone OnDemand  Martin Marietta Materials And SS C Technologies,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 7  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Copart Inc    NASDAQ CPRT    Performance Food Group Co    NYSE PFGC    Cornerstone OnDemand Inc    NASDAQ CSOD    Martin Marietta Materials Inc    NYSE MLM   and SS C Technologies Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SSNC   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Stocks with Good Entry Points Amid Stock Market PullbackWall Street had a dream run in 2019 wherein the benchmark S P 500 and tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index recorded the highest gain since 2013 while the blue chip index the Dow closed 2019 with its biggest yearly percentage gain since 2017  However  the stock markets retreated on Jan 3 after the U S  airstrikes in Iran that killed its military general Qasem Soleimani Fearing an escalation in geopolitical conflict in the Middle East and possible retaliatory measures by Iran  Wall Street plummeted  Crude oil prices jumped and investors shifted to safe haven assets like gold and government bonds However  the recent stock market pullback is a welcome development as it will help correcting higher stock valuation to some extent and consequently be a good entry point for risky assets like equities Recent Downturn May Be TemporaryDownturn in U S  stock markets may continue for the next few weeks  Iranian state TV said Iran will no longer abide by uranium enrichment limits  However  a full phased war such as the gulf war of 1980s and 1990s are unlikely to happen    Following the escalation of U S  Tran conflict  both the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0 8  while the S P 500 declined 0 7   These drops are negligible compared with these three index s gain of 1 7   3 6  and 2 9   respectively  in December Wall Street bull run likely to continue in this year buoyed by an expected interim trade deal between the United States and China  which will at least prevent further escalation of tariff war  A phase one trade deal is likely to restore U S  business confidence significantly which in turn will help the sagging manufacturing sector for a rebound  Moreover  U S  exports  especially the technology and industrial products  will be bolstered once the global economy revives Other PositivesA stable U S  economy is the biggest positive for U S  stocks  The U S  GDP growth is over 2  despite being its 126th month of expansion  Strong consumer spending  which constitutes 70  of GDP  a strong labor market  a historically low level of unemployment steady growth in wage rate will bolster investors  sentiments  Moreover  an accommodative Fed is likely to be a cushion for stock markets In 2019  the Dow and the S P 500 crossed technically vital 28 000 and 3 000 levels for the first time and are currently firmly settled above those physiological barriers  Meanwhile  the Nasdaq Composite also crossed 9 000 for the first time in 2019 and currently hovering around that level Most importantly  all three major stock indexes are at present well above their respective 50 day and 200 day moving averages  In financial literature  the 50 day moving average line is generally recognized as the short term trend setter  while the 200 day moving average is considered a long term trend setter Moreover  50 day moving average of each of these stocks indexes is ahead of their respective 200 day averages  It is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50 day moving average line surges ahead of the 200 day moving average line  a long term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank  We have narrowed down our search to five growth stocks  with strong EPS estimate revision and future growth potential  Each of our picks carries either a of

3904,225419,CSOD,Bet High On Earnings Beat By These 6 Tech Stocks ,opinion,Technology stocks saw a stronger than anticipated start to fourth quarter earnings  Per the latest   the sector is now expected to report earnings growth of 7 3   much better than 4  expected at the start However  growth rate has significantly declined from the last couple of quarters  This is primarily due to lackluster results from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and a number of chipmakers  including Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  and Intel  NASDAQ INTC  Apple reported dismal iPhone sales  primarily due to sluggish demand in Greater China and fewer upgrades in developed countries  Being Apple suppliers  weak iPhone sales don t bode well for a number of semiconductor companies  like Qorvo  Skyworks  NASDAQ SWKS  and Lumentum Texas Instruments stated weak demand from Chinese smartphone manufacturers in the quarter  Meanwhile  chip maker NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  slashed its top line guidance on macroeconomic weakness in China Moreover  Intel s warning over sluggish cloud spending doesn t bode well for the sector Semiconductor Growth ModeratesManufacturers of semiconductors  which are the building blocks for most of AI and IoT  reported impressive 2018 numbers  Per the Semiconductor Industry Association  global semiconductor  totaled  468 8 billion in 2018  up 13 7  over 2017 However  month over month growth continued to decline  Global sales in December were  38 2 billion  down 7  from the November figure  Moreover  fourth quarter sales declined 8 2  sequentially to  114 7 billion Notably  tariff imposition owing to the U S  China trade tussle has been taking a toll on chipmakers for a while now  China happens to be one major market for semiconductors  while the United States is the biggest semiconductor manufacturing country Moreover  CPU shortage hurt PC shipments in the fourth quarter  per Gartner  The market research firm also blamed sluggish consumer demand during the holiday season for the weak sales According to IDC  fourth quarter PC  declined due to economic tensions between China and the United States along with  shortfall of Intel CPUs  Xilinx  NASDAQ XLNX   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Google Shine BrightEarnings beats from semiconductor stocks like Xilinix  Teradyne and Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  buoys optimism  Facebook reported solid fourth quarter results on an

also  positive earnings and revenue surprises   Despite headwinds  impressive results from these bellwethers hint at abound growth prospects for technology stocks Semiconductors are still expected to benefit from growing proliferation of high performance robust chips across various domains   electronic gadgets to cars  planes and advanced weaponry Rapid adoption of AI  cloud  IoT  autonomous cars  advanced driver assisted systems  wearables  virtual reality augmented reality devices presents massive growth opportunity  Furthermore  the accelerated deployment of 5G technology is encouraging Moreover  increasing video streaming has been driving user engagement that is  in turn  attracting advertising dollars  Notably  real time analysis of user data supported by AI tools is helping advertisers target the right audience  which is boosting their return on investment Additionally  growing demand for smart speakers and connected devices  which are powered by AI  machine learning and deep learning  is a key catalyst How to Make the Right Pick With the existence of a number of industry players  finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a

9324,230839,CSOD,5 Stocks With Good Entry Points Amid Stock Market Pullback,opinion,Wall Street had a dream run in 2019 wherein the benchmark S P 500 and tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index recorded the highest gain since 2013 while the blue chip index the Dow closed 2019 with its biggest yearly percentage gain since 2017  However  the stock markets retreated on Jan 3 after the U S  airstrikes in Iran that killed its military general Qasem Soleimani Fearing an escalation in geopolitical conflict in the Middle East and possible retaliatory measures by Iran  Wall Street plummeted  Crude oil prices jumped and investors shifted to safe haven assets like gold and government bonds However  the recent stock market pullback is a welcome development as it will help correcting higher stock valuation to some extent and consequently be a good entry point for risky assets like equities Recent Downturn May Be TemporaryDownturn in U S  stock markets may continue for the next few weeks  Iranian state TV said Iran will no longer abide by uranium enrichment limits  However  a full phased war such as the gulf war of 1980s and 1990s are unlikely to happen    Following the escalation of U S  Tran conflict  both the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0 8  while the S P 500 declined 0 7   These drops are negligible compared with these three index s gain of 1 7   3 6  and 2 9   respectively  in December Wall Street bull run likely to continue in this year buoyed by an expected interim trade deal between the United States and China  which will at least prevent further escalation of tariff war  A phase one trade deal is likely to restore U S  business confidence significantly which in turn will help the sagging manufacturing sector for a rebound  Moreover  U S  exports  especially the technology and industrial products  will be bolstered once the global economy revives Other PositivesA stable U S  economy is the biggest positive for U S  stocks  The U S  GDP growth is over 2  despite being its 126th month of expansion  Strong consumer spending  which constitutes 70  of GDP  a strong labor market  a historically low level of unemployment steady growth in wage rate will bolster investors  sentiments  Moreover  an accommodative Fed is likely to be a cushion for stock markets In 2019  the Dow and the S P 500 crossed technically vital 28 000 and 3 000 levels for the first time and are currently firmly settled above those physiological barriers  Meanwhile  the Nasdaq Composite also crossed 9 000 for the first time in 2019 and currently hovering around that level Most importantly  all three major stock indexes are at present well above their respective 50 day and 200 day moving averages  In financial literature  the 50 day moving average line is generally recognized as the short term trend setter  while the 200 day moving average is considered a long term trend setter Moreover  50 day moving average of each of these stocks indexes is ahead of their respective 200 day averages  It is widely recognized in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50 day moving average line surges ahead of the 200 day moving average line  a long term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank  We have narrowed down our search to five

9331,230846,CSOD,Microsoft Inks Mega Deal With India s Jio,opinion,"Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   has signed a 10 year deal with India s largest telecom company Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd   a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited  The companies will work together to create the digital framework for small  medium and large scale companies in the country  facilitating their move to the cloud 
The deal is significant because of the government s goal of bringing India to the digital age  particularly with respect to data analytics  artificial intelligence  cognitive services  blockchain  IoT and edge computing  spurring technology led GDP growth  Reliance  with its 331 million subscribers and extensive 4G network  represents the kind of assets that would further the government s plans 
For Microsoft  this is a very big deal because it will result in large scale adoption of its collaborative solutions in connectivity  computing  storage and other technology services 
First  Reliance will internally adopt Microsoft cloud technology through Office 365 while migrating its non network applications to Azure 
Second  Reliance will try to get its startup customers on Microsoft Azure right from the get go 
Third  Reliance will develop cloud based applications and services on Azure that it will distribute to its startup  SMB and large scale customers 
Fourth  Microsoft s natural language  all major Indian languages and some dialects  based technological solutions and computer vision technologies will be adopted by Reliance to facilitate rapid adoption 
Gartner says that India s public cloud market will grow 24 3  from a very small base to generate revenues of  2 4 billion in 2019  Sid Nag  research vice president at Gartner attributes the increased corporate investment to a shift from  cloud first  to a  cloud only  model as seen from their disinvestments in new data centers  This is precisely the trend that the partnership will cater to in the startup community 
And speaking of data centers  Jio will set up data centers with next generation compute  storage and networking capabilities that Microsoft will use to host its Azure cloud platform  The first two of these  in Gujarat and Maharashtra  will be fully operational next year  This will help the localization of data belonging to Indians  something that the government has become more serious about  in line with global trends 
  We have an incredible opportunity to apply advances in technology to help organizations across India innovate and grow   said Nadella   The combination of Jio s leading connectivity and digital solutions with Azure  Azure AI and Office 365 will bring powerful tools and platforms for compute  storage  productivity and more to millions of businesses in the country  
 Jio is delighted to partner with Microsoft in our efforts to further deepen the use of technology on scale to all Indians   said Mukesh Ambani  Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries   This is a unique and first of its kind partnership that brings the capabilities of two large companies focused on creating significant value to Indian enterprises   small and large  By working together to develop innovative and affordable cloud enabled digital solutions built around Jio s world class digital infrastructure and Microsoft s Azure cloud platform  we will accelerate the digitization of the Indian economy and make Indian businesses globally competitive  This will be a showcase to the world to demonstrate tech enabled value creation that is both exponential and inclusive    
Last Word
This of course doesn t mean that Microsoft will immediately become the leading cloud infrastructure player in India  given Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   early start and the broad acceptability of Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google  But it positions Microsoft really well for very strong growth in the emerging Indian market that could at least make it one of the leading players

9340,230855,CSOD,The SEC Is Starting To Worry About Non GAAP Earnings,opinion,"We ve been sounding the alarm on non GAAP earnings for  now  Companies exploited the wide leeway granted by the SEC to present their business in a more favorable light  What was originally intended to be a supplement to GAAP results has in many ways replaced them  Too many investors in the market seem to implicitly trust non GAAP earnings without digging deeper to understand the misleading way companies exclude real expenses 
Non GAAP continues to gain more traction among public companies   S P 500 companies reported some form of non GAAP results last year 
Going In The Opposite Direction
Unsurprisingly  companies that use non GAAP earnings tend to make themselves look better  Valeant  NYSE VRX   Cornerstone OnDemand  NASDAQ CSOD   and Zillow  NASDAQ Z  stand out among recent companies we ve put in the Danger Zone for inflating their profitability using non GAAP 
For companies in the S P 500  non GAAP net income continued to rise  increasing 6 6  last year  As Figure 1 shows  both GAAP net income and economic earnings are moving in the opposite direction 
Figure 1  Real Profitability Is On The Decline

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Our random sample of 40 S P companies found that of those that reported non GAAP earnings 92  adjusted their earnings higher  That number includes four companies that  when we adjusted their GAAP earnings to net operating profit after tax  NOPAT   ended up with lower profits 
For instance  QEP Resources  NYSE QEP  reported a GAAP net loss of  149 million but a non GAAP profit of  2 million for 2015  Most of that difference can be explained by QEP excluding  
By only excluding unrealized gains losses  QEP significantly misleads investors  The company also had  461 million in realized gains from derivative contracts in 2015  Excluding the unrealized losses but including the realized gains in non GAAP income inflates QEP s reported profitability 
We adjust out all gains and losses from derivatives  as these are not a part of the company s core operating activity  Our calculation of NOPAT shows that QEP actually lost  190 million last year  more than it reported on a GAAP basis and significantly worse than the misleading non GAAP numbers it promoted to investors 
Red Flag Adjustments
As anyone that regularly reads our work knows  we have no problem with making adjustments to GAAP accounting data  In fact  we make dozens of adjustments to close accounting loopholes and build models that more accurately reflect the true operating performance of the companies we follow  Many of the adjustments that companies make  such as removing the impact of   are ones we make too 
The fact that companies report earnings that don t conform to GAAP standards is not the problem  The problem is that the earnings companies report often have no sound methodological basis and are designed to simply give the illusion of greater profitability 
In particular  companies routinely make the same adjustments that remove real operating expenses from their calculations of non GAAP income 
Amortization of Intangible Assets  Serial acquirers love this adjustment  They overpay for acquisitions and don t have to take responsibility for the destruction of shareholder value that results 
Stock Based Compensation  Companies justify removing stock compensation on the grounds that it s a  non cash  expense  but that s simply not true  By diluting the stock  the company is paying its employees with the future cash flows that would have gone to shareholders  More directly  many companies  to offset the share dilution  leading to a much more immediate cash expense 
Various Overhead Costs  Companies lump all sorts of minor general and administrative expenses into buckets that they exclude for the purposes of non GAAP earnings  Eliminating  10 million in  advisory costs  or  personnel costs  here and there can be a great way to just barely meet earnings expectations 
Companies regularly exclude these costs  but they rarely excluded non operating income  You won t see many examples of companies using non GAAP numbers to highlight how their GAAP profits are actually inflated by foreign currency fluctuations  decreasing reserves  or changes in contingent considerations 
GAAP Is A Problem  But Non GAAP Is Not The Solution
The SEC allows companies to report non GAAP metrics under the assumption that these numbers can give a better picture of the true business performance to investors  The fact that the SEC allows these nonconforming metrics shows that it understands the issue with current GAAP standards 
GAAP was originally designed for debt investors  not equity investors  It requires companies to report their earnings in a way that can significantly distort the true operating profitability that matters most to equity holders 
Unfortunately  companies led by executives looking to maximize their pay are not motivated to give investors a more accurate picture of their business  They want to give investors the most favorable picture  and non GAAP has become a handy tool to achieve that goal 
Investors Need To Be More Aware
  companies are not supposed to place non GAAP earnings more prominently than GAAP results in their filings  In practice  companies stretch the limits of this rule all the time  They play up the importance of non GAAP earnings and the financial media and Wall Street follow right along 
When reporting its   Ohio based utility First Energy  FE  led off with its non GAAP earnings before discussing GAAP results  That sure seems as if non GAAP was given more prominence 
The financial media certainly gave more prominence to the adjusted figures  Every outlet I could find  by  0 01 on a non GAAP basis  Discussions of its GAAP results were either buried far down the page or completely nonexistent 
When CFOs tell you that   you should be suspicious of a company that beats expectations by a penny using an opaque and unaudited financial measure of profitability 
The SEC has said it will  of companies using non GAAP earnings  but they haven t given many specifics on enforcement  Ultimately  investors have to perform their own diligence to cut through the misleading stories told by companies and understand their true profitability
