23724,245239,MHO,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  MHO  KBH  MDC  RH And TPX,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  January 24  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO    KB Home   NYSE KBH    M D C  Holdings  Inc    NYSE MDC    RH   NYSE RH   and Tempur Sealy International  Inc    NYSE TPX   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog U S  Housing Booming in 2020  Here s How to Trade ItLast month s home sales  including existing and new homes  were 10 8  higher than the same period a year ago  In fact  sales of previously owned homes rose 3 6  last December compared with November to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 54 million despite the shortage of supply of properties for sale  per the National Association of Realtors Home sales picked up in the second half of last year  providing fresh momentum heading into 2020  especially with the economy growing at a healthy pace and borrowing rates remaining attractive  The pace of U S  economic expansion accelerated in the third quarter of 2019  Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the economy grew at an annualized rate of 2 1  in the three months ended Sep 30  versus the initial estimate of 1 9  and 2  in the second quarter  The unemployment rate  by the way  is at its lowest level in half a century Meanwhile  the average interest rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage now is around 3 6   down from 4 45  a year ago  according to Freddie Mac  It s worth pointing out that the Fed s interest rate cuts for three times last year have dragged mortgage rates down from the year earlier   Across the board  U S  homebuilding activity hit a 13 year high last month  Housing starts climbed 16 9  on a seasonally adjusted annual rate to 1 608 million units  the highest since December 2006  And it s way beyond analysts  expectations of an increase of 1 375 million units in December  Residential investments  by the way  rebounded in the third quarter of 2019 after contracting for six straight quarters  the longest since the 2007 09 recession Notably  millennials are anticipated to propel the housing market this year  Most of these individuals will turn 30 next year and consider buying their first home  In fact  millennials are expected to take half of all mortgages next year  surpassing both Generation X and Baby Boomers  per realtor com The report states that demand for especially entry level homes will pick up  thanks to millennials driving overall demand  And buyers will certainly benefit from almost flat home prices  which are predicted to increase only 0 8   The report added that home prices may even decline in cities such as Dallas  Las Vegas  Miami  Chicago and San Francisco Skeptics  in the meantime  may argue that the U S  housing market will face tough times in 2020  the same way it did in 2005  However  unlike 2005  the risks of speculation have gone down  and questionable mortgages like no documentation loans aren t taking place this time around  Thus  it can be safely said that probability of a housing crash this year is limited  Quite the reverse  the iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB   which predominantly tracks homebuilding stocks  hit a 13 year high last week  So far this year  ITB has increased more than 6  compared with the S P 500 s rise of around 3   Over the past 12 month period  the ITB is up 47 3   while the S P 500 is up 21 7  5 Solid BuysGiven the aforesaid positives  investing in housing related stocks that can make the most of the improved homebuilder sentiment this year seems judicious  We

23733,245248,MHO,Buyouts  Infrastructure Services Aid Quanta  PWR  Amid Hurdles,opinion,Quanta Services Inc    NYSE PWR   has been benefiting from its focus on the base business  long term programmatic spend of utilities  and development of infrastructure that supports technology deployments such as 5G and electric vehicles  Shares of the company have gained 27 3  over the past year  outperforming its  s 20 7  rally  Also  it has outperformed the S P 500 s 24 9  rise in the said period  The company s price performance was mainly driven by a solid earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 of the trailing 13 quarters The above mentioned tailwinds  acquisitions   which were completed in the third quarter   and construction on the Watay and East West Tie Line transmission projects are set to put the company on growth trajectory in 2020 and beyond However  volatility in Pipeline and Industrial operations  and consumer spending have been affecting the company s projects  as well as orders Let s delve deeper into the factors supporting its Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Major Growth DriversQuanta Services has been delivering robust performance over the last few quarters  Notably  the company s earnings grew 30 3  year over year in the first nine months of 2019  backed by strong segmental performance  Quanta Services believes that the delivery of energized services differentiates it from its competitors and helps it win new businesses  Currently  the company is pursuing a three pronged growth strategy focusing on timely delivery of projects to exceed customer expectation  leverage on core business for expansion in complementary adjacent service lines and continue exploring new service lines It ended the third quarter with a record backlog of approximately  13 28 billion and 12 month backlog of  7 56 billion  This compares favorably with  12 34 billion of total backlog and  6 98 billion of 12 month backlog at 2018 end  Also  the reported backlog was up from total backlog of  12 21 billion and 12 month backlog  7 48 billion at the end of third quarter 2018  This demonstrates the strength of its core operations Meanwhile  the Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure segment s outlook looks promising  In the first nine months of 2019  the company s Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure segment recorded double digit revenue growth  up 12 8  year over year  and improvement in operating margin  up 200 basis points  bps    The upside was mainly supported by base business activities in natural gas distribution  pipeline integrity and industrial service operations  as well as significantly larger pipeline project activity The North America electric transmission and distribution markets are expected to act as one of the key growth drivers for the company  as the region continues to deploy more capital for transmission and distribution upgrades to improve system reliability  and deliver renewable electricity from new generation sources to the demand centers  In a nutshell  growth of the electric power segment is expected to be fueled by the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure  generation mix shift to more renewable and natural gas  grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability Quanta Services sees acquisitions as a fundamental component of its strategy to boost market share and develop incremental backlog  Quanta Services completed six acquisitions during the nine months of 2019 and four during 2018  The 2019 and 2018 buyouts strategically expanded its domestic electric power and communications service offerings Key ConcernsVolatility in Pipeline and Industrial operations  and consumer spending have been affecting the company s projects  as well as orders  The segment s third quarter 2019 revenues were somewhat offset by a decline in revenues from larger pipeline projects  Also  in the first nine months of 2019  its Electric Power Infrastructure Services operating margin declined 160 bps due to the absence of large projects compared with the year ago period Key PicksSome better ranked stocks in the broader space are KB HOME

23817,245332,MHO,3 Stocks To Consider As Home Builder Confidence Hits 20 Year High,opinion,"Home builder confidence in the newly built  single family home market jumped 5 points in December to 76  This was the highest reading since June 1999  according to the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index 
A strong domestic economy and a housing shortage helped drive the confidence to the highest level in two decades   Builders are continuing to see the housing rebound that began in the spring  supported by a low supply of existing homes and low mortgage rates   NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde said in a statement 
Let s take a look at a few stocks that can potentially capitalize on the favorable conditions 
D R  Horton   NYSE DHI   is the one of the largest homebuilders in the United States  with operations in 90 markets and 29 states  In the company s recently reported fiscal 2019  68  of its home sales were in the sub  300 000 price point  First time homebuyers accounted for over 50  of sales 
The homebuilder has seen its shares climb around 55  in 2019  outperforming its broader industry s 41  run  D R  Horton trades at around 10 9X its forward earnings  which is just below the industry average of 11 8X forward earnings  In addition  the company has steadily raised its dividend over the past five years and it currently yields 1 28  
Our consensus estimates for Q1 call for a top line gain of 7 7  to  3 77 billion and a bottom line hike of over 21  to  0 92 per share  D R  Horton s earnings estimates have been revised higher recently  helping earn DHI stock a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
M I Homes   NYSE MHO   shares have nearly doubled in 2019 to dwarf the S P 500 s 26  run  MHO is coming off a third quarter where sales increased 15  and earnings rose 30   M I Homes sold a record 1 721 homes during the third quarter  which was a 32  improvement from the year ago quarter 
Our Q4 Zacks consensus estimate anticipates earnings to grow over 40  to  1 85 per share and for revenue to jump 14  to  824 million  MHO stock trades at around 8 3X forward earnings  which puts it at a discounted level compared to the industry average of 11 8X  The stock s discounted forward multiple could provide a solid entry point for investors looking to ride the momentum of a homebuilder that has skyrocketed this year  
Meritage Homes   NYSE MTH   is another homebuilder that has benefited from the favorable macroeconomic conditions  MTH shares have soared over 70  YTD and is coming off a third quarter that saw home closing revenue climb 7  and diluted earnings rally 35   Total orders rose 24  in the third quarter as well 
Meritage Homes has also tried to focus on the shortage of entry level homes in the housing market as its average sales price dropped 4   The company also delivered 54  order growth in the entry level market with the company s LiVE NOW  Homes 
While our estimates forecast moderate gains in the fourth quarter  our Q1 estimates tell a different story  Q1 estimates call for sales to rise 13 5  to  792 6 million and for earnings to soar over 67  to  1 09 per share  Looking even further down the line  our fiscal 2020 estimates predict total sales to reach  3 85 billion for a 9  bump and for earnings to climb over 20  to  5 68 per share  MTH sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is a good stock to consider for investors looking to cash in on the growth in entry level homes

components of builders  confidence  current sales condition  sales expectations in the next six months and buyer traffic added 7  1 and 4 points respectively NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz believes that the near term positive market conditions  a nearly 50 year low unemployment rate and increased wage growth have pushed the confidence level higher  However  supply side constraints like labor and

 rise in single family permits The low mortgage rates influenced by the Federal Reserve s three consecutive interest rate cuts this year has not only helped Americans facing affordability challenges  but also revived the interest of buying homes  Moreover  Fed s decision of keeping interest rates unchanged through 2020 will also keep the cost of debt low  encouraging Americans to buy homes

Analyst Blog U S  Home Price Gains Gather Pace in September  5 Top PicksU S  home price gains accelerate in September after a long period of decelerating price increases  According to the S P CoreLogic Case Shiller U S  National Home Price Index  U S  home prices rose 3 2  year over year in September  following a gain of 3 1  in August on a national level The 20 City Composite Home Price Index rose 2 1  year over year  after 2 0  gain in August  However  the 10 City Composite Home Price index remained flat with the 1 5  rate of August  Low supply of homes for sale associated with strong housing demand resulted in accelerated price increases Momentum Likely to ContinueThe strong pricing momentum in the housing sector is likely to continue in the near future  The U S  housing sector rebounded in October buoyed by a low mortgage rate and a fundamentally stable domestic economy  which is growing for the historically longest 11 years  albeit with some loss in pace The housing starts marked the second highest gain in October while building permits achieved the highest level in more than 12 years  Moreover  new home sales in October came in at 733 000  slightly below the revised estimates of 738 000 in September  original reading was 701 000   However  the figure surpassed the consensus estimate of 706 000   Turnaround in the housing sector is important since it generates more than 3  of the U S  GDP  The Fed has reduced the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points  which has helped the mortgage rate remain low  According to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mae  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 4   well below 4 94  in November 2018 Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with a favorable

Let s take a look at how things are shaping up for 2020 
Affordable Mortgage Rates
Weekly average of the 30 year fixed mortgage rates as of Dec 12  2019  was down 0 90 bps from the prior year to 3 73   according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac  The Fed has cut rates thrice this year and gave hints of no hike in 2020 
Low mortgage rates have worked wonders for housing stocks this year  With the Fed being dovish  this rate sensitive sector has every reason to outperform  read    
Upbeat Economic Data
Decent economic fundamentals are fueling growth in the sector  Jobs data deserves a special mention  In November  U S  employers added 266 000 new jobs  after an upwardly revised 156 000 gains in October  The latest number beat market expectations of 180 000  It was the highest gain in payrolls since January  read    
Notably  Consumer Expenditure Survey done by Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2017 showed that housing takes the major chunk    of the average annual spending  So  an almost 50 year  low unemployment level and steady wage growth bode well for the homebuilding sector 
Trade Deal to Lower Surging Costs 
Investors should also note that higher operating costs make homes more expensive  which is deterring entry level buyers  According to the NAHB  the U S  China trade war has affected  used in the homebuilding industry  Apart from costs  the homebuilding sector is not that dependent on China  With a phase one trade deal cut between the duo  we might see some decline in raw material costs  read    
Millennials  Home Buying Spree

Notably  this population is currently driving the homebuying market  In 2018  millennials made up the largest chunk of home buyers at 37   About  are now millennials  up from 20  five years ago   on this generation  contribution from which will grow in the coming days  This is especially true given that  has been solid  read    
Solid Zacks Ranks 
The homebuilding industry belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 20  of 250  industries   Most of the homebuilding stocks like D R  Horton   NYSE DHI    PulteGroup   NYSE PHM    Meritage Homes   NYSE MTH   and M I Homes Inc    NYSE MHO   carry a Zacks  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
ETF Exposure
Housing ETFs mainly include SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSE XHB   iShares ITB and Hoya Capital Housing ETF  HOMZ   DHI holds the first spot in the 45 stock ITB  with a 13 44  weight  and the third position in the 35 stock XHB  with 4 68  exposure  HOMZ has  however  a 1 65  allocation to the stock  PulteGroup gets 7 6  of ITB  4 8  of XHB and 1 6  of HOMZ 
Bottom Line
Having said all  we would like to note that pressure on inventory and rising prices are bothering the space  The median house price was  in October from last year s level  At October s sales pace  3 9 months were enough to   down from 4 3 months a year ago  This led some buyers out of the market  Still  things in the homebuilding space are not as bad as feared  Upbeat earnings performance  low rates and solid Zacks Ranks make housing ETFs compelling buys right now

23899,245414,MHO,Builder Confidence Ends 2019 At 20 Year High  5 Housing Picks,opinion,U S  homebuilder sentiment was strong at the end of 2019  Per the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI   confidence level among builders jumped five points to 76 in December from the revised November reading of 71  Notably  the December reading marked the highest level since June 1999  Builders are continuing to see the housing rebound that began in the spring  supported by a low supply of existing homes  low mortgage rates and a strong labor market   NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde said in a statement All the three indices registered gains in December  A gauge of present sales conditions rose seven points to 84 from November  Traffic of prospective buyers also increased four points to 58 and sales predictions for the next six months edged up one point to 79 The three month moving averages for regional HMI reading were impressive in all regions other than Northeast  Midwest reported a five point gain to 63  West increased three points to 84 and South rose one point to 76 from the prior month figure  However  Northeast fell two points to 61 from a month ago Solid Economic Fundamentals Hold KeyThe impressive readings are reflective of solid prospects in the U S  homebuilding sector  Lower mortgage rates  Fed s dovish stance  solid economic growth and favorable demographics are adding to the industry s strength  Also  a 50 year low unemployment rate and increased wage growth make the picture rosier The U S  economy grew at 2 1  in third quarter 2019  exceeding the initial estimate of 1 9   At the same time  consumer confidence levels remained high  thanks to almost a 50 year low unemployment level  scarce layoffs and steady rise in wages  These will certainly improve consumer outlays as well However  the housing market has its share of challenges  Supply side constraints like labor and land availability continue to put pressure on builders  margins  Also  higher development costs are hurting affordability and dampening its prospects to some extent Nonetheless  improved housing starts data in recent months should continue to favor the industry  Housing starts jumped 3 8  in October from September  which is a positive sign for the overall economy as developers anticipate higher demand  Also  low mortgage rates should continue to stimulate appetite among buyers  keeping sales volume positive in 2020 5 Top Construction PicksIn view of the aforementioned positives  we have selected five homebuilding companies that

in the Northeast and South regions  Sales in the Northeast declined by 18 2  to a rate of 27 000 and sales in the South plunged to a rate of 436 000 by 3 3  However  there was unexpected growth in

which represents 5 3 months of supply at the current rate of sales Further  out of the total houses sold in October  nearly two thirds were either under construction or yet to be built Low Mortgage

is below the November 2018 peak of 4 9   This cheap borrowing cost has propelled the demand for new homes However  other economic data from the Commerce Department on Nov 19 also pointed at steady growth in the housing market  U S  housing starts jumped 3 8  in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 314 000 and building permits  a measure for future home building  rose to 1 461 000

than 2 6   including a 3  fall on Aug 5  the largest daily drop of the benchmark index so far in 2019 Wall Street will start its innings in September with a series of risk factors  Renewed tariff war between the United States and China  global economic slowdown  geopolitical conflicts are the major headwinds  However  the biggest event to watch will be the Fed s upcoming FOMC meeting this month  which will likely to guide investors  decisions for the next couple of months Stock Market s Major Sources of RisksThe tariff war between the United States and China intensified from Sep 1  as the U S  government imposed 15  tariff on nearly  112 billion of Chinese goods  Most of these items are consumer products and various U S  companies have already said that they have no option but to shift higher input costs to customers  Consequently  consumer spending  which jumped 0 6  in July  is likely to suffer a setback going forward  Notably  personal consumption constitutes two third of the U S  GDP Meanwhile  lingering trade war between the two largest trading nations of the world  is leading toward a global economic slowdown  Germany and Italy  the biggest two economies of the Eurozone

said that the rate cut is simply a mid cycle correction  However  Powell later reiterated the central bank s pledge to do whatever needed to ensure the ongoing expansion of the U S  economy The U S  economy is currently facing a dichotomy  The consumer and labor markets are doing extremely well while the business segment  especially manufacturing  remained tepid owing to a prolonged trade dispute

24005,245520,MHO,Should Value Investors Pick M I Homes  MHO  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  M I Homes has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 12  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 54  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts MHO s current PE ratio which is slightly below its midpoint  which is 10 83  over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Construction sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 69  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that M I Homes has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 74  so it is fair to say a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for M I Homes stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  M I Homes has a P S ratio of about 0 44  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 27 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  M I Homes currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes M I Homes a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though M I Homes might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives M I Homes a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been promising  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and none lower  while the current year has also seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has improved 7 2  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has also climbed 8 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below M I Homes  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineM I Homes is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a strong industry rank  top 10  out of more than 250 industries  and a top Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trend to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well 5 Stocks Set to Double Zacks experts released their picks to gain  100  or more in 2020  One is a famous cutting edge food company that is  hiding in plain sight   Swamped with competitors and ignored by Wall Street  its stock price floundered  Now  suddenly  it acquired a company that gives it an advantage none of its peers have ,2019-09-16,Zacks Investment

24006,245521,MHO,Housing Market Bounces Bank  5 Stock Winners,opinion,The housing market is finally expanding after being in recession for quite a long time  Strong employment  declining mortgage rates and strong monthly confidence index of home builders have given a boost to the home building sector Thus  investing in home builders can prove healthy for your portfolio  Let s have a look Housing Market s Current StateThe trade war had freaked out investors and pushed yields on U S  Treasury bonds to plunge 2  in August  the yields of those bonds influenced mortgage rates  When Treasury bond yield falls it pulls down the interest rates on mortgages with it  As the inverted yield curve in mid August flashed recessionary warnings  investors pulled out money from equity and invested in safe haven assets and bonds As per the Mortgage Bankers Association  MBA  reports  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate fell eight basis points in mid July to 3 93   which is the lowest since 2016 and has dropped 80 point in 2019  But  on Aug 15  MBA s Refinance Index jumped 37   the highest level in the last three years as existing homeowners race to draw benefits from the falling interest rates  Refinancing also led to the increase in home mortgage application in August On the other hand  as per government reports  sales of new homes had plunged 13  in July  making it the biggest monthly decline since July 2013  Several factors contributed to this decline  sales of new homes in the Northeast led the decline by 50   Notably  the Northeast leads in sales compared to South and West The picture is quite different in September though  when stocks of home building companies are at their best since 2012  banking on a drop in mortgage rate and firming housing date  The unemployment rate is also low and consumers have enough money to spend that further boosts this industry On Sep 17  the National Association of Home Builders   NAHB  monthly confidence index read a 1 point increase to 68  which is definitely matching with the highest reading in a year  Any reading above 50 signals that confidence among builders is improving  Specifically  the gauge of current single family home sales has also increased to 75 by 2 points Future of Housing MarketsSales of new homes were on a roller coaster ride since 2018  but are gradually rising with mortgage rates falling to multiyear lows  Falling mortgage rates have boosted sales and seem to be falling even further  thereby promoting sales  This has made home builders optimistic as we can see from the NAHBs  monthly confidence index reading of 68 in September Further  political factors like President Donald Trump s attack on the central banks to lower interest rate will also impact the mortgage rate  If the country s benchmark interest rate drops to below zero  it will not benefit the U S  housing market as such  In fact  lenders especially banks will become stingier with the loans  as it would be costing them higher Another factor that will affect the industry is the heightening of the U S  China trade war  Tensions increasing between them will harm the economy and flare up recessionary fears  Buyers are banking on a strong labor market and signs of a downturn can reverse the rise 5 Stocks to BuyWe have thus shortlisted five stocks from the housing sector that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  M D C  Holdings  Inc    NYSE MDC   is a publicly traded company that engages in homebuilding and financial service businesses in the United States  M D C  s expected earnings growth

24008,245523,MHO,Solid August Data   Fed s Rate Cut Light Up Housing  5 Picks,opinion,The month of August saw blistering growth in U S  housing since mid 2007  The rebound in the sector was much anticipated  thanks to lower mortgage rates According to Commerce Department data released on Sep 18  housing starts jumped 12 3  month over month   the highest level since June 2007   to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 364 million units in August  beating the consensus of 1 249 million units by 9 2   Also  the August figure rose 6 6  on a year over year basis  Notably  the July figure was also revised up to 1 215 million units versus 1 191 million units reported previously Single family homebuilding  accounting for the lion s share of the housing market  rose 4 4  from July in August  the best since January  Starts for the volatile multi family housing segment soared 32 8  in August  reversing the prior two months  declines Moreover  residential building permits  an indicator of construction activity  leaped 7 7  month over month in August to an annualized rate of 1 419 million units   the highest since May 2007  The August permit level surpassed analysts  prediction of 1 280 million units by 10 9   Permits to build single family homes jumped 4 5  and that for multi family homes increased 13 3  last month  Trends to Rule HousingAlthough the Fed does not control mortgage rates  any movement in federal funds rate might have an impact  As expected  the Federal Reserve or Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate for the second time since July by a quarter point to a range of 1 75  to 2  in its two day policy meeting under the chief Jerome Powell  on Sep 18  Slowing global economy and tensions from the trade war between the U S  and China likely spurred the Fed to cut rates Now  the Fed s latest 25 bp rate cut is certainly going to work in favor of housing  Consumers  borrowing costs have already been declining since the Fed cut interest rates in July  fueling a trend of mortgage refinancing and thereby lending support to household spending despite economic uncertainty In the recent Primary Mortgage Market Survey report published by Freddie Mac  the 30 year  fixed rate mortgage average declined to 3 56  from the previous year s 4 60  and from 3 75  in the week before the Fed s Jul 30 31 policy meeting  Also  mortgage purchase applications for the month of August increased 33  on a year over year basis  per the Mortgage Bankers Association  MBA  Builder Application Survey Low mortgage rates and a solid labor market are helping the residential construction  which hasn t contributed to economic growth since the end of 2017 In fact  the homebuilding industry has been on the rise since January  buoyed by above mentioned tailwinds  The Zacks  industry has risen 41 6  so far this year  comparing favorably with the S P 500 s rally of just 18 5   Will Supply Dearth   Trade War Stall Housing Momentum Despite historically low mortgage rates and rising wages  the housing market has been strained by a low inventory of affordable homes  thanks to rising construction costs and shortage of land or lots  In fact  lack of supply has been the biggest hurdle in the path of housing market recovery Meanwhile  builders also noted that the year long U S  China trade war  which has slowed the manufacturing sector  is impeding home construction in some parts of the country  The trade spat has certainly caused uncertainty for builders as well as for price conscious buyers  regarding both domestic and global economic growth Nonetheless  with both starts and permits coming in at levels not perceived in more than 12 years  the optimism surrounding the housing market has been reinstated  Then again  it remains to be seen whether the August result is an anomaly  given the trade war challenges and high land  labor and materials costs Stocks to Bet OnAdding some homebuilding stocks  which have been cashing in on the positive market dynamics  looks like a smart move at this point  Notably  the homebuilding industry is in the top 9  of the Zacks Industry Rank However  picking winning stocks is no mean feat  With the help of the

24011,245526,MHO,Housing Market Bounces Back  5 Stock Winners  Revised ,opinion,The housing market is finally expanding after being in recession for quite a long time  Strong employment  declining mortgage rates and strong monthly confidence index of home builders have given a boost to the home building sector Thus  investing in home builders can prove to be healthy for your portfolio  Let s have a look Housing Market s Current StateThe trade war had freaked out investors and pushed yields on U S  Treasury bonds to plunge 2  in August  the yields of those bonds influenced mortgage rates  When Treasury bond yield falls it pulls down the interest rates on mortgages with it  As the inverted yield curve in mid August flashed recessionary warnings  investors pulled out money from equity and invested in safe haven assets and bonds As per the Mortgage Bankers Association  MBA  reports  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate fell eight basis points in mid July to 3 93   which is the lowest since 2016 and has dropped 80 point in 2019  But  on Aug 15  MBA s Refinance Index jumped 37   the highest level in the last three years as existing homeowners race to draw benefits from the falling interest rates  Refinancing also led to the increase in home mortgage application in August On the other hand  as per government reports  sales of new homes had plunged 13  in July  making it the biggest monthly decline since July 2013  Several factors contributed to this decline  sales of new homes in the Northeast led the decline by 50   Notably  the Northeast leads in sales compared to South and West The picture is quite different in September though  when stocks of home building companies are at their best since 2012  banking on a drop in mortgage rate and firming housing date  The unemployment rate is also low and consumers have enough money to spend that further boosts this industry On Sep 17  the National Association of Home Builders   NAHB  monthly confidence index read a 1 point increase to 68  which is definitely matching with the highest reading in a year  Any reading above 50 signals that confidence among builders is improving  Specifically  the gauge of current single family home sales has also increased to 75 by 2 points Future of Housing MarketsSales of new homes were on a roller coaster ride since 2018  but are gradually rising with mortgage rates falling to multiyear lows  Falling mortgage rates have boosted sales and seem to be falling even further  thereby promoting sales  This has made home builders optimistic as we can see from the NAHBs  monthly confidence index reading of 68 in September Further  political factors like President Donald Trump s attack on the central banks to lower interest rate will also impact the mortgage rate  If the country s benchmark interest rate drops to below zero  it will not benefit the U S  housing market as such  In fact  lenders especially banks will become stingier with the loans  as it would be costing them higher Another factor that will affect the industry is the heightening of the U S  China trade war  Tensions increasing between them will harm the economy and flare up recessionary fears  Buyers are banking on a strong labor market and signs of a downturn can reverse the rise 5 Stocks to BuyWe have thus shortlisted five stocks from the housing sector that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  M D C  Holdings  Inc    NYSE MDC   is a publicly traded company that engages in homebuilding and financial service businesses in the United States  M D C  s expected earnings growth

as Existing Home Sales Pick Up PaceSales of previously owned homes increased in July  despite shortage of lower priced homes  After declining for the last five consecutive months  the metric increased on declining mortgage rates  which improved affordability  and strong labor market  Also  it outpaced the consensus estimate by 0 7  Despite headwinds arising from a global economic slowdown  the overall U S  housing industry looks good  supported by the Federal Reserve s dovish stance  While low mortgage interest rates are helping prospective buyers  shortage of low priced homes is pushing up prices  making it difficult for them to get involved in more transactions Let s delve deeper into the numbers to get a clearer picture of the announcement Encouraging Home Sales DataPer the National Association of Realtors    NAR    sales of existing homes  accounting for more than 90  of total U S  home sales  grew 2 5  from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 42 million units in July  Also  the metric rose 0 6  from 5 39 million reported in July 2018  Notably  it was the first year over year increase in the last 17 months and the second highest level in 2019 Post the news release  the exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry witnessed an upside  The SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF increased 1 5   iShares U S  Home Construction ETF

the 89th straight month of year over year increase Inventory slipped in the month  leaving lesser number of homes for future sales  Total housing available for sale decreased 1 6  from both June 2019 and July 2018 level  Unsold inventory is at a 4 2 month supply level  at the current sales pace  which is down from 4 4 months in June and 4 3 months a year ago In the words of NAR s chief economist Lawrence Yun   Home buying is a serious long term decision and current low or even lower future mortgage rates may not in themselves meaningfully boost sales unless accompanied by improved consumer confidence  First time buyers accounted for 32  of sales in July  down from 35  reported in the prior month and in line with a year ago  Moreover  NAR revealed that the annual share of first time buyers in 2018 was 33  A Look at Recent Mortgage RatesAccording to the latest Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  mortgage rates remained flat for the week ending Aug 15 from a week ago and declined 93 points from a year ago  Notably  the average U S  rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage was lowest since November 2016  Also  mortgage demand reached a three year high in the said week  Declining mortgage rates allowed refinance activity to exceed past records As revealed by Mortgage Bankers Association s  MBA  Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending Aug 16  Refinance Index grew 0 4  from the previous week and a notable 180  from the year ago period  reaching the highest level since July 2016 Along with lower mortgage rates  the recent cut in interest rates by Fed to stimulate growth in economic activities is a boon for the housing industry Lower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowing for consumers  thereby aiding buyers to have greater access to funds  Notable homebuilders are optimistic as they have been reporting firm demand for single family homes  However  they continue to struggle with rising construction costs stemming from excessive regulations  persistent shortage of workers and lack of buildable lots 4 Must Buy Housing StocksThere are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and

Rebound  4 Housing PicksAfter experiencing a tough time in the last two months  sales of previously owned houses rebounded strongly in May 2019  rising in each of the four major U S  regions  The Northeast witnessed the biggest increase last month Declining mortgage rates  moderating home prices  rising wages and dovish Federal Reserve stance helped the U S  housing market regain its momentum Home Sales Data EncouragingThe National Association of Realtors    NAR   said on Friday that sales of existing homes  accounting for more than 90  of total U S  home sales  increased 2 5  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 34 million units last month from 5 19 million in April  However  the metric decreased 1 1  from 5 4 million a year ago Notably  the recent data marked the second highest level since the beginning of 2019 Regionally  sales in the Northeast  which account for the majority of existing home sales  rose 4 7  to 670 000 units  almost in line with the prior year period  While sales in the Midwest advanced 3 4  in May  the same increased 1 8  in both South and West regions Median sales price in May rose 4 8  to  277 700 from the comparable year ago period  marking the 87th straight month of year over year increase In May  total housing inventory grew 4 9  from the previous month and 2 7  from the prior year period  It will take just 4 3 months to deplete the current supply of homes  up from 4 2 months in April as well as in May 2018 First time buyers accounted for 32  of sales in May  in line with the prior month but up from 31  recorded a year ago  Moreover  NAR revealed that the annual share of first time buyers in 2018 was 33  The uptick in each of the abovementioned metrics reflects that buyers are excited to reap the benefits of favorable market conditions  Lawrence Yun  NAR s chief economist  said  The purchasing power to buy a home has been bolstered by falling mortgage rates  and buyers are responding  Declining Mortgage Rates to Boost SalesThe overall housing industry has been booming over the past few months  backed by declining mortgage rates and strengthening builder s confidence Although mortgage rates increased 2 points last week  it remained 73 points lower than a year ago  The average U S  rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage was 3 84  for the week ending Jun 20  according to the latest Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  This marked an increase from the previous week s 3 82  but was down from 4 57  a year ago  The recent decline in mortgage rates should benefit existing home sales in the near term Homebuilder confidence has also been growing since the beginning of the year  Though the metric fell two points in June from the previous month  as measured by the National Association of Home Builders  Index  the gap does not reflect that homebuyer demand has stalled  As evident from increased refinance activity and loan amounts  consumers still have the willingness and capacity to purchase homes Meanwhile  investors remain optimistic that the Federal Reserve or Fed will cut federal funds interest rate in July  Recently  the Fed opted to keep the benchmark rate in a target range of 2 25 2 5   with a vote of 9 1  indicating readiness to lower interest rates for the first time in more than a decade  citing  uncertainties  in the outlook  Notably  after raising federal funds rate nine times in three years  the Fed reversed its course last December on concerns related to slowing economy and U S  China trade war  This is indeed a major boon for the rate sensitive housing market In a nutshell  improving economic conditions  rising disposable income and favorable demographic changes are likely to support demand in the near term 4 Must Buy Housing StocksThere are plenty

Homebuilders to Buy as New Home Sales ReboundIn June  new home sales staged a strong rebound after two straight months of decline  However  sales for the three preceding months were revised downward  Additionally  the metric came in below expectations  leading to speculation that housing recovery had stalled once again However  enough evidence to the contrary is already available  For one  homebuilder sentiment ticked upward this month  boosted the level of supply of existing homes  More importantly  mortgage rates continue to plumb lower depths  raising the affordability of homes for prospective buyers If there is weakness in the housing market  it is largely temporary in nature  New home sales have increased over the first half of the current year  primarily due to the fall in real mortgage interest rates  Adding homebuilder stocks to your portfolio would make for a smart choice   New Home Sales Recover in JuneNew home sales increased 7  to clock a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646 000 units in June  In doing so  the metric came in below the estimated level of 656 000  However  it still represents a recovery from two straight months of decline and an improvement from May s level of 604 000 At the same time  the figure for May has been revised downward from the earlier estimate of 626 000 units  Data for March and April were also revised lower  However  June s new home sales registered a year over year increase of 4 5   Some analysts have of course also emphasized the volatile nature of the metric Homebuilder Sentiment Trends HigherIn July  the National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index inched up by 1 point to hit 65  Naysayers were quick to point out that the reading is well below the July 2018 level of 68  But any level above 50 denotes an expansion  in this case firm demand for single family homes A new report from realtor com has stated that the supply of home for sales has slipped and inventories could hit a fresh low in October  However  this was not apparent from the new home sales data Even if only the current pace of sales is maintained  6 3 months would elapse before supplies are exhausted  This is marginally higher than the level of 6 months which is considered the hallmark of a balanced housing market  Strong Labor Market  Low Rates to Fuel Home BuyingGoing forward  the health of the housing market  as indeed of the entire economy  depends on the strength of the labor market  This in turn will likely fuel consumers  confidence upward  resulting in higher sales  However  Josh Shapiro  chief economist at MFR Inc believes that  the current level of starts of single family homes is supported by final demand  And any weakness in the market is likely only temporary  Overall  the housing market has been on the mend since the beginning of the year  This is primarily attributable to the decline in real mortgage interest rates Americans have purchased around 54 000 new single family homes since January  This represents a 2  improvement from the first half of 2018  As of now  this promises to be the best year for new home sales since 2007 Our ChoicesThe solid rebound in new homes sales indicates that the housing recovery continues to chug along  Any weakness in the housing market is only temporary and sales are likely to be driven higher over the rest of the year by falling real mortgage rates  A strong labor market is also contributing to robust sentiment Investing in homebuilder stocks still looks prudent  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score

24061,245576,MHO,5 U S  Focused Stocks To Buy On Fresh Trump Tariffs,opinion,On Aug 2  the S P 500 suffered its worst weekly decline of the year on renewed trade tensions  In a series of tweets  President Trump stepped up the protectionist rhetoric against China  He also announced fresh tariffs on the country s imports  Trump sent out another barrage of tweets on Aug 3  defending his decision to impose fresh tariffs on China China hit back on Aug 5 by allowing the yuan to plummet and stopping all imports of American agricultural goods  Experts now believe that these tensions will continue in the long term  with Trump s policies likely to remain in place even if he loses next year s presidential polls Given this backdrop  investing in U S  focused industries such as regional banks and homebuilders with a domestic focus looks like a smart option Trump Imposes New Duties on China ImportsOn Aug 2  President Trump announced that he would impose a new 10  duty on additional  300 billion worth of Chinese goods  These fresh tariffs  which will be effective Sep 1  will now target virtually all of China s imports to the United States  These duties span a wide range of products  from smartphones to clothing In fact  Trump ignored the views of his advisors on this issue despite a heated round of discussions  Reportedly  he remained adamant that tariffs were the best method to get China to fall in line with American demands  China s foreign minister Wang Yi criticized the decision  saying tariffs were  not a constructive way to resolve economic and trade frictions    Duties Likely to Remain in Place Post 2020The battle lines have hardened with Beijing promising to respond in kind to Trump s latest salvo  For starters  Chinese authorities let the yuan fall to its lowest level in a decade on Aug 5  The People s Bank of China attributed the plunge to Trump s protectionist policies  as well as expectations of more tariffs on China  Meanwhile China s state owned enterprises have been asked to cease imports of all U S  agricultural goods  A section of experts is more or less certain that protectionist trade policies are likely to remain firmly in place  Last week  former U S  ambassador to China  Gary F  Locke  said these measures will stay in place  even with a possible change of administration in 2020  Our ChoicesPresident Trump seems keen to boost his trade rhetoric ahead of the 2020 U S  presidential elections  He seems convinced that tariffs are the best way to get China to agree to America s demands  regardless of the domestic economic fallout in the interim Investing in stocks of U S  focused companies such as homebuilders and regional banks would be prudent in such an environment  They would likely provide better returns compared to their peers with higher overseas exposure  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a

24063,245578,MHO,Are The Homebuilder Stocks The Deal Of The Year ,opinion," 0 30    Mortgage Loans Hit New Lows Since 2016 4 30    The negative Side of the Housing Market 8 45    Tracey s Top Stock Picks 26 15    Episode Roundup  KBH  PHM  MHO  LEN  TOL Welcome to Episode  189 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 
Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
This week she s going solo to discuss the developments in the US housing market and the homebuilder stocks in 2019 
Goldilocks Conditions for the Homebuilders 
With the 10 year treasury falling to levels last seen in 2016  that means that mortgage rates have also fallen under 4  again to multi year lows 
Additionally  the job market remains strong with unemployment under 4   The consumer feels confident and that usually means that they will look to make big purchases  like homes 
Could low mortgage rates and a strong job market be the perfect combination for a boom for the homebuilders 
And if so  where should investors be looking 
The Homebuilder Stocks are Cheap
Despite the industry seeing a 30  gain on the year  thanks to the stocks being hit hard in the December 2018  they are still cheap 
Of the five homebuilders highlighted on the podcast  all of them are trading under 10x earnings  Other than retail and energy  it s hard to find another industry as cheap 
But Are They Buys 
1        KB Home   NYSE KBH   trades with a forward P E of just 9 8 yet earnings are expected to rise 56  this year  In the second quarter  a weak coastal California market was countered by stronger orders in Denver and Houston  Will lower mortgage rates help to turn California around 
2        PulteGroup   NYSE PHM   trades with a forward P E of just 9 2  Orders were up 7  in the second quarter as first time home buyer orders surged 30   However  active adult concepts declined 7  as those buyers were more cautious coming out of the housing and stock market weakness of 2018 
3        M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO   is even cheaper  with a forward P E of just 8 3  It also doesn t have California exposure but is still fighting the industry wide issue of higher incentives and discounting  However  in the second quarter  the company said those incentives have not gotten worse 
4        Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   saw elevated selling incentives and higher land and labor costs which ate into margins  The higher end coastal communities in California were sluggish  It too is cheap with a forward P E of 9 3 but earnings are expected to fall 16  in fiscal 2019 
5        Toll Brothers Inc    NYSE TOL   is about to report its third quarter results on Aug 20  In the second quarter  it saw higher selling incentives and also had west coast issues  Orders dropped 45  in California in Q2 but mortgage rates have fallen significantly since the spring  Shares are trading at just 9 1x forward earnings

24064,245579,MHO,GW Pharmaceuticals  NetApp  KB Home  PulteGroup  M I Homes  Lennar And Toll Brothers Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 15  2019    GW Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ GWPH   as the Bull of the Day  NetApp   NASDAQ NTAP   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on KB Home   NYSE KBH    PulteGroup   NYSE PHM    M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO    Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   and Toll Brothers Inc    NYSE TOL   Here is a synopsis of all seven stocks  I last wrote of GW Pharmaceuticals as the  in late July before their Q2 earnings report last week  Now that those numbers have  wowed the crowd   it s definitely time to update one of the most exciting growth stories in medicine right now Also since that report  which describes the company s 20 year history of cannabis derived medicine R D  I bought the stock for my TAZR Trader portfolio  Here was the trade alert I gave my members on August 1   Portfolio is buying GW Pharmaceuticals between  155 and  160 with an X  allocation     See both my Fundamental and Technical notes below first    Fundamental View  I told you I had this one on my radar and I think now is the time to start a position ahead of earnings next Tuesday  And on Monday  the Piper Jaffray analyst Danielle Brill raised her Q2 sales projections for Epidiolex from  43M to  50M based on their scripts tracking data  Average analyst price targets are now over  200 based on the blockbuster sales growth potential   1 2 billion  of the only FDA approved cannabis derived drug maker  who also happens to have a 20 year track record of innovation and a burgeoning pipeline Technical View  In April  the stock filled the Feb earnings gap in the low  150s and that s when we bought in HCare Innovators and rode to new highs on the May earnings rally above  185  The stock has risk now to test the low  150s again so you can be patient here and let it come to you  And we ve got the 200 day down at  153ish  just above the April low of  151  I think the stock drifting lower now is just sifting out weaker hands  maybe in sympathy with a crushing of the marijuana stocks  and setting up for a potential sling shot move on earnings once the growth trajectory is confirmed Well  on Aug 6  GW Pharma delivered a bigger sales beat for Epidiolex  the first FDA approved cannabis derived drug  than even the most optimistic analysts were projecting GWPH crushed the sales number for the treatment of two rare forms of pediatric epilepsy with  68 million vs  consensus of  45M  And the stock was actually up over 10  in after hours that night to nearly  170 With a morning dip under  160 on Aug 7  I told my people it was another prime opportunity to add shares  The next day  the stock went to  175 Here was the update I gave that night   GW Pharma Wows  Em Again with Epidiolex Launch MomentumAnalysts are busy raising estimates and price targets  PT  after this big sales beat  Here s a sample   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Analyst David Lebowitz raised his 2019 Epidiolex sales estimate to  291M from  165M after GW Pharmaceuticals report sales that  easily exceeded consensus  in the drug s second full quarter on the U S  market  The analyst  who noted that significant adoption from adult patients continues and management continues to anticipate dose to increase as physicians become more comfortable administering  raised his price target on GW Pharmaceuticals shares to  238 and keeps an Overweight rating on the stock Oppenheimer  Analyst Esther Rajavelu raised her price target for GW Pharmaceuticals to  239 from  234 after the company reported Epidiolex revenues higher than estimates  representing 104  sequential growth  driven by new patients  favorable reimbursement  and increasing use among adult epilepsy patient in the quarter  The analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on the shares Stifel Nicolaus analysts raised their price target in a nominal gesture to  228 from  227  The team led by Paul Matteis was not that surprised by the sales beat given their extensive physician survey work that I shared with you last week  Here is a summary of their call   They reiterate their Buy rating on impressive 2Q19 Epidiolex sales of  68MM  which were  50  better than consensus of  44MM  Looking ahead they raise their 3Q 4Q Epidiolex estimates  and remain optimistic that the launch can continue to beat expectations into the latter half of the year as they believe management s guidance is conservative  Bottom line  With a  5 billion market cap and sales quickly accelerating to over  500 million in the next year    representing triple digit growth    GW Pharma and Epidiolex are on their way to blockbuster status  I don t think the stock trades for under  5 billion for very long so look for your entries during this selloff Disclosure  I own GWPH shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader  NetApp is an  11 billion provider of a full range of hybrid cloud data services that simplify management of applications and data across cloud and on premises environments On August 2nd NetApp provided something investors did not like  soft preliminary results for Q1 FY 2020 as well weaker guidance for the year In the conference call  management noted that broader weakness in macroeconomic environment compelled the company s enterprise customers to trim capital expenditure  This negatively impacted NetApp s storage business Markedly  adoption of hybrid multi cloud offerings  Cloud Data Services and Private Cloud increased year over year in the first quarter  but couldn t mitigate the decline in storage business For Q1  NetApp anticipates revenues in the range of  1 22 billion to  1 23 billion  indicating a year over year decline of approximately 17   Earlier  management had anticipated net revenues for first quarter to be in the range of  1 315  1 465 billion  The preliminary results reflect decline of approximately 11 9  from the mid point Following the bleak preliminary first quarter results and trimmed outlook for fiscal 2020  NetApp shares were down 20  Here s what I told my TAZR Trader members that night  as we own a few software analytics players like Alteryx  AYX  that thrive in the cloud big data ecosystems   Gunfight at the Big Data CorralPosted on 8 2 19My title theme tonight concerns the big earnings blow ups in Arista Networks   NYSE ANET    down 10  on heavy volume  and Network Appliance   NASDAQ NTAP   down 20  on massive volume  These are both hardware focused companies providing cloud infrastructure and services So what happened to Arista that could read through to the cloud data center analytics space William Blair analysts summed up the ANET bomb by framing Arista s Q2 EPS beat as buoyed by the announcement that the specific  cloud titan  that hit the pause button on spending in the second quarter  which they believe to be Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   will be resuming ordering in the second half of 2019 While this resumption suggests that the pullback in cloud spending was a blip  not a trend  and Arista is abound in positive developments  e g   continued strength in the enterprise vertical  momentum in new logo adds  excitement around the pending entry into the Campus market  sustained non GAAP operating margins in the mid to high 30  range   management continues to strike a more conservative tone around cloud titan spending Exactly my point of why the cloud data center build out could be as cyclical as Semis And this is why I focus on the software big data analytics plays now  like Alteryx So what happened to NetApp that took their shares down 20  out of nowhere KeyBanc analysts had one of the best notes here   Major Reset on Demand OutlookNetApp issued preliminary F1Q20 guidance that was materially below consensus  missing revenue by  165M and outlining a major retreat in storage demand  especially in the U S  On the call  NetApp suggested that the installed base is still working through capacity adds from CY18  as well as internal sales executions issues The KeyBanc team  shaking their heads  are now projecting product growth at  13  y y in FY20 and  4  in FY21 This outlook from a  15 billion player in hybrid cloud data services that serve APM  application performance management  across cloud and on premises environments is NOT GOOD for many also ran data focused players Thankfully  AYX is one of the emerging top dog players  even though most companies and investors don t know their name or their expertise yet All that mystery bodes well for us  end of Aug 2 TAZR commentary excerpt NTAP became a Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell  a few days later  as estimates plummeted  For the full year FY 2020  Q1 ended July   EPS projections dropped over 20  from  4 97 to  3 92  And next year s EPS was also taken down 20  from  5 61 to  4 44   On Aug 14  NTAP delivered official results for the quarter with  0 65 vs the new consensus of  0 57  which fell from  0 83  Also last night  cloud monster Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   delivered mixed results and guidance with mentions of macro growth concerns and trouble bidding on contracts in China  Go figure So by the time you are reading this on Thursday morning  the Tech sector could be under even more pressure Bottom line for NTAP  Great company but until these estimates stop going down and start heading back up  stay away from the shares  The Zacks Rank will let you know Disclosure  I own AYX shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio Additional content Are the Homebuilder Stocks the

24067,245582,MHO,4 Housing Stocks To Buy As Existing Home Sales Picks Up Pace,opinion,Sales of previously owned homes increased in July  despite shortage of lower priced homes  After declining for the last five consecutive months  the metric increased on declining mortgage rates  which improved affordability  and strong labor market  Also  it outpaced the consensus estimate by 0 7  Despite headwinds arising from a global economic slowdown  the overall U S  housing industry looks good  supported by the Federal Reserve s dovish stance  While low mortgage interest rates are helping prospective buyers  shortage of low priced homes is pushing up prices  making it difficult for them to get involved in more transactions Let s delve deeper into the numbers to get a clearer picture of the announcement Encouraging Home Sales DataPer the National Association of Realtors    NAR    sales of existing homes  accounting for more than 90  of total U S  home sales  grew 2 5  from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 42 million units in July  Also  the metric rose 0 6  from 5 39 million reported in July 2018  Notably  it was the first year over year increase in the last 17 months and the second highest level in 2019 Post the news release  the exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry witnessed an upside  The SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF increased 1 5   iShares U S  Home Construction ETF gained 1 4  and Invesco Dynamic Building   Const ETF was also up 1  Also  homebuilders such as Hovnanian Enterprises   NYSE HOV    Century Communities  Beazer Homes USA   NYSE BZH   and Lennar   NYSE LEN   gained 18 5   2 6   2 1  and 1 2   respectively  Sales of previously owned homes recorded growth across the Midwest  South and West regions in July  with the exception of Northeast  In fact  the West witnessed a significant rise Sales in the West region jumped 8 3  from the prior month but were down 0 8  from year ago period  Sales in the Northeast  which account for the majority of existing home sales  fell 2 9  from June and 4 3  year over year Median existing home price in the month rose 4 3  to  280 800 from the comparable year ago period  marking the 89th straight month of year over year increase Inventory slipped in the month  leaving lesser number of homes for future sales  Total housing available for sale decreased 1 6  from both June 2019 and July 2018 level  Unsold inventory is at a 4 2 month supply level  at the current sales pace  which is down from 4 4 months in June and 4 3 months a year ago In the words of NAR s chief economist Lawrence Yun   Home buying is a serious long term decision and current low or even lower future mortgage rates may not in themselves meaningfully boost sales unless accompanied by improved consumer confidence  First time buyers accounted for 32  of sales in July  down from 35  reported in the prior month and in line with a year ago  Moreover  NAR revealed that the annual share of first time buyers in 2018 was 33  A Look at Recent Mortgage RatesAccording to the latest Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  mortgage rates remained flat for the week ending Aug 15 from a week ago and declined 93 points from a year ago  Notably  the average U S  rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage was lowest since November 2016  Also  mortgage demand reached a three year high in the said week  Declining mortgage rates allowed refinance activity to exceed past records As revealed by Mortgage Bankers Association s  MBA  Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending Aug 16  Refinance Index grew 0 4  from the previous week and a notable 180  from the year ago period  reaching the highest level since July 2016 Along with lower mortgage rates  the recent cut in interest rates by Fed to stimulate growth in economic activities is a boon for the housing industry Lower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowing for consumers  thereby aiding buyers to have greater access to funds  Notable homebuilders are optimistic as they have been reporting firm demand for single family homes  However  they continue to struggle with rising construction costs stemming from excessive regulations  persistent shortage of workers and lack of buildable lots 4 Must Buy Housing StocksThere are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and the long term  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult With the help of the Zacks   we have zeroed in on four stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of A or B  A top Zacks Rank indicates that these stocks have been witnessing positive estimate revisions  which generally translates into rapid price appreciation Our VGM Score identifies

 confidence in newly built single family homes improved mostly due to a lower interest rate environment Consequently  home building related stocks are well poised to ramp up profits and scale northward Home Builder Sentiment Hits a 7 Month HighThe housing market went through a torrid time last year  To make things worse  sales of previously owned homes slumped this month registering the second straight month of a sales decline  The National Association of Realtors claimed that the drop in sales was due to lower supply of homes than required And how can we forget that existing home sales  which constitute almost 90  of the housing market  dropped in March for the fourth time in five months  while new home construction decelerated to its slowest pace since May 2017 Nonetheless  U S  homebuilder confidence in the newly built  single family home market did improve this month  easily surpassing estimates  The National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index

catching up after a wet winter and many characterize sales as solid  driven by improved demand and ongoing low overall supply   But most importantly  sentiments improved predominantly owing to lower mortgage rates NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz summed up perfectly by saying that  mortgage rates are hovering just above 4 percent following a challenging fourth quarter of 2018 when they peaked near 5 percent  This lower interest rate environment  along with ongoing job growth and rising wages  is contributing to a gradual improvement in the housing market  Rates of home loans have declined of late  According to Freddie Mac  the 30 year fixed rate mortgage averaged 4 10  in the May 9 week  But now  it s down 4 basis points  So far this year  the 30 year fixed has averaged 4 30   down from 4 54  in 2018 Similarly  the 15 year fixed rate mortgage is at present averaging 3 57   down from an earlier 3 60   To top it  the 5 year Treasury indexed hybrid adjustable rate mortgage is now

24102,245617,MHO,Homebuilding Industry Poised To Pop,opinion,"The trade war has sparked tensions for many  particularly those with exposure to tech  But there are a few areas that may even be benefiting from the current nervousness in the stock market 
The housing market is one such area  Despite regional variation in prices  weather  demand  and so on  there are some really big drivers that apply to the industry overall 
For one  this market is actually seeing some supply shortage because of a reduction in the number of homes built over the last 10 years  This was partly because of economic pressures and partly because millennials have been steering clear off the market  preferring to rent or stay at their parents  The other major reason has been the inability to make a decent profit in the affordable housing area  which has pushed homebuilders toward the  luxury  market 
Since millennials  an 80 million  market  according to the Census Bureau  are now showing some tendency to set up homes  demand is likely to pick up  which will lead to higher volumes that could allow profitability again at the low end   
In the meantime  the supply shortage has led to a huge increase in home prices that is not commensurate with the increase in wages  In fact  experts like Lending Tree Chief Economist Tendayi Kapfidze says that the lack of affordable housing has pushed up home prices to 3X the increase in wages 
As a result  despite the fact that home buyers are living in the same homes for longer than they ever have before  11 years   they aren t showing any desire to move  Therefore  the existing home sales market  which comprises 90  of the housing market  is actually showing a slight decline in sales 
So how does this tie in with the trade war 
Tensions in the stock market are leading more investors to the bond market  which in turn is lowering bond yields  The yield on the 10 year determines mortgage rates  which explains why they are at their lowest level in almost a year  Lower mortgage rates obviously make housing more affordable  which could attract the buyers waiting on the sidelines 
Conclusion
So we re seeing pent up demand because of demographics and mortgage rate related affordability  Significantly higher demand is likely to encourage building at the low end  where there is shortage   which in turn will lead to profitability at home builders

24122,245637,MHO,Existing Home Sales Rebound In May  Top 4 Housing Picks,opinion,After experiencing a tough time in the last two months  sales of previously owned houses rebounded strongly in May 2019  rising in each of the four major U S  regions  The Northeast witnessed the biggest increase last month Declining mortgage rates  moderating home prices  rising wages and dovish Federal Reserve stance helped the U S  housing market regain its momentum Home Sales Data EncouragingThe National Association of Realtors    NAR   said on Friday that sales of existing homes  accounting for more than 90  of total U S  home sales  increased 2 5  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 34 million units last month from 5 19 million in April  However  the metric decreased 1 1  from 5 4 million a year ago Notably  the recent data marked the second highest level since the beginning of 2019 Regionally  sales in the Northeast  which account for the majority of existing home sales  rose 4 7  to 670 000 units  almost in line with the prior year period  While sales in the Midwest advanced 3 4  in May  the same increased 1 8  in both South and West regions Median sales price in May rose 4 8  to  277 700 from the comparable year ago period  marking the 87th straight month of year over year increase In May  total housing inventory grew 4 9  from the previous month and 2 7  from the prior year period  It will take just 4 3 months to deplete the current supply of homes  up from 4 2 months in April as well as in May 2018 First time buyers accounted for 32  of sales in May  in line with the prior month but up from 31  recorded a year ago  Moreover  NAR revealed that the annual share of first time buyers in 2018 was 33  The uptick in each of the abovementioned metrics reflects that buyers are excited to reap the benefits of favorable market conditions  Lawrence Yun  NAR s chief economist  said  The purchasing power to buy a home has been bolstered by falling mortgage rates  and buyers are responding  Declining Mortgage Rates to Boost SalesThe overall housing industry has been booming over the past few months  backed by declining mortgage rates and strengthening builder s confidence Although mortgage rates increased 2 points last week  it remained 73 points lower than a year ago  The average U S  rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage was 3 84  for the week ending Jun 20  according to the latest Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  This marked an increase from the previous week s 3 82  but was down from 4 57  a year ago  The recent decline in mortgage rates should benefit existing home sales in the near term Homebuilder confidence has also been growing since the beginning of the year  Though the metric fell two points in June from the previous month  as measured by the National Association of Home Builders  Index  the gap does not reflect that homebuyer demand has stalled  As evident from increased refinance activity and loan amounts  consumers still have the willingness and capacity to purchase homes Meanwhile  investors remain optimistic that the Federal Reserve or Fed will cut federal funds interest rate in July  Recently  the Fed opted to keep the benchmark rate in a target range of 2 25 2 5   with a vote of 9 1  indicating readiness to lower interest rates for the first time in more than a decade  citing  uncertainties  in the outlook  Notably  after raising federal funds rate nine times in three years  the Fed reversed its course last December on concerns related to slowing economy and U S  China trade war  This is indeed a major boon for the rate sensitive housing market In a nutshell  improving economic conditions  rising disposable income and favorable demographic changes are likely to support demand in the near term 4 Must Buy

two points to 80  Traffic of prospective buyers were steady at 54  but the component gauging current sales conditions dropped one point to 78 The current reading indicates that builders feel good about the recent tax cuts and have no qualms as such regarding the rising interest rates  Fueled by robust economic growth  Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes in 2018  setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates NAHB Chairman Randy Noel  a custom homebuilder from LaPlace  Louisiana  stated   Builders are excited about the pro business political climate that will strengthen the housing market and support overall economic growth  Will the Upbeat Scenario Continue Through 2018 The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018  courtesy of an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  positive consumer confidence  a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs In spite of shortage in inventory  robust demand from a solid labor market is keeping the industry alive  General unemployment rates in the United States have been at a 17 year low of 4 1  for the fourth straight month  with around 200 000 jobs added in January 2018   Other hurdles such as rising prices  thanks to the limited land availability which is keeping the affordability in check  Again  homebuilders continue to struggle against higher material costs and a constrained

24172,245687,MHO,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Lennar  M I Homes And William Lyon Homes,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 4  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Housing  Part 2  including Lennar   NYSE LEN    M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO   and William Lyon Homes   NYSE WLH   Industry  Housing  Part 2Link  Although the home sales data is not impressive so far this year  the larger picture is indeed a big success  Homebuilders still expect strong demand for new homes as low unemployment and steady economic growth support Americans  buying power Of course  finding buildable lots has been a major challenge in the industry in recent times  which could limit their ability to meet demand  That said  homebuilders are currently well placed  belonging to a top ranked Zacks Industry     suggesting that the market headwinds were unable to take the sheen away from the sector There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector for both the short and the long term  Below we discuss a few key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead Robust Economic GrowthThe U S  economy is anticipated to grow at a 4  annualized rate in the second quarter  per the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow forecast model showed on May 25  This is quite a sharp increase from 2 3  GDP growth registered in the first quarter of 2018 Fueled by robust economic growth  Fed policymakers are looking at three rate hikes this year  setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates  Nevertheless  Americans are seeing wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Although this may face varied obstacles  we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2018 This upbeat expectation holds particularly true when one of the nation s key economic drivers  i e  construction activity  is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate  The unemployment rate has fallen to 3 9  in April 2018   the lowest since December 2000 Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand Solid Builders  Confidence Builders  confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April  reinstating builders  confidence in the current housing market  Importantly  the reading was above the 50 mark in the first five months of 2018  indicating a favorable outlook  Moreover  this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70 Notably  the National Association of Home Builders or NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI  includes builder perceptions of current single family home sales  sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers Higher Demand  Low Inventory to Boost PricesSteady economic growth along with favorable demographics and the attractiveness of ownership versus rental are driving demand  Although recent home sales have been volatile month over month  the year over year growth rates are indeed compelling  New home sales were up 11 6  year over year in April 2018 On the other hand  a shortage in buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is giving a boost to prices and is expected to continue doing so for some time The supply of April existing homes decreased 6 3  from the year ago period  It has fallen year over year for 35 consecutive months  As such  it will take only four months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market versus 4 2 months a year ago  according to NAR Thanks to low inventory and high demand  median sales price of existing homes increased 5 3  in April 2018 from a year earlier  The median sales price of new homes sold in April was  312 400  0 4  higher from the year ago period We believe prices will continue to scale as demand for homes is likely to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment  Improving labor markets  declining unemployment rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices  thereby giving a boost to homebuilders  top line For 2018  National Association of Home Builders or NAHB expects continued growth for home construction and remodeling  The home improvement sector should also remain strong given recent home price gain  increases in homeowner wealth and other lifestyle improvements Millennials Take InterestMillennials   those born after 1980   are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section  although many disagree with this view  This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce First time buyers comprised 33  of sales in April 2018  which is up from 30  in March but slightly down from 34  a year ago  NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers  released in late 2017  revealed that the annual share of first time buyers was 34  Boosting Land Bank Amid Rising CostsU S  homebuilders have been seeking various ways to increase their land holding amid rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market that hinder efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market Again  limited capital for land development has left entitled lands in short supply  while growing demand drives land prices  The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of labor  arresting the rapid growth in housing production Land development and homebuilding are correlated but fundamentally different operations  Prominent homebuilders are buying out major land developers that will help them address the ongoing issues In February 2018  Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc  in a  9 3 billion deal  including debt   which creates one of the country s top homebuilders  Since the closing of the transaction  Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior  100 million synergy savings expectations for fiscal 2018 and is on track to meet  365 million synergies for fiscal 2019 as well In February 2017  Lennar acquired Florida based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc   a premier lifestyle community developer and luxury homebuilder of single and multi family homes  to enhance its land holdings Meanwhile  in March 2018  M I Homes  Inc   one of the nation s leading builders of single family homes  closed the acquisition of the residential homebuilding assets and operations of Pinnacle Homes  a homebuilder in the greater Detroit  MI market Again  William Lyon Homes completed the acquisition of RSI  a Southern California and Texas based homebuilder  and three related real estate assets on Mar 9  2018  This addition spreads the company s footprint in the Inland Empire of California and marks its entry into Texas Strong Stocks that Should Be in the NewsMany are little

24173,245688,MHO,New Home Sales Surge To 16 Month High In March  5 Top Picks ,opinion,Sales of new homes in the United States jumped to a 16 month high in March  marking the third straight monthly increase  Declining mortgage rates  moderating home prices  rising wages and the Federal Reserve s dovish stance are helping the U S  housing market to regain its footing iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB   gained 1 3  while the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  increased 1 1   Shares of leading homebuilders such as Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL    M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO    D R  Horton Inc    NYSE DHI   and Beazer Homes USA  Inc    NYSE BZH   surged 1 1   1 4   1 6  and 3 2   respectively  in the last session Key TakeawaysThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday that sales of newly constructed single family homes  accounting roughly 10  of all U S  home sales  grew 4 5  from the February tally to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692 000 units last month   the highest level since November 2017  Moreover  March sales came in above the consensus forecast of 645 000 and were 3  higher than March 2018  Notably  February s sales pace was revised down to 662 000 units from the previously reported 667 000 units From the beginning of 2019  new home sales are up just 1 7  yet stronger than the same period last year Regionally  sales in the South  which

 the supply of new homes decreased 0 3  from February to 344 000  However  housing inventory increased 15 8  from a year ago  It would take just six months to deplete the current supply of homes  down from 6 3 months in February Strong readings in March clearly suggest that sales of new homes were not impacted by supply disruptions like sales of previously owned homes  Notably  other March data came in less bullish  as existing home sales were weighed down by a persistent shortage of lower priced houses and housing starts slumped to the slowest pace since May 2017 Declining Mortgage Rates  A BoonAlthough mortgage rates increased last week or for the third consecutive week  it remains lower than a year ago  This must have lured more buyers in the key spring selling season  The average U S  rate for a 30 year fixed mortgage is 4 17  for the week ending Apr 18  according to the latest Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey  This is up from the previous week s 4 12  but down from 4 47  a year ago After rising nearly 5  in November 2018  average mortgage rates are trending downward  offering a major boost to home sales after a torrid second half of 2018 Meanwhile  Mortgage Bankers Association Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting Joel Kan noted that purchase activity remained robust  reaching its highest level since April 2010  This surely reflects of a strong spring homebuying season A classic example of the recent positive housing trend can well be traced through the first quarter earnings numbers  On Tuesday  PulteGroup Inc    NYSE PHM   reported better than expected   Shares of the company gained 3 7   following the earnings release   Helped by the recent decline in mortgage rates  homebuyers have been steadily returning to the market after a period of slowing demand that began in the second half of 2018   said Ryan Marshall  President and CEO of PulteGroup  Picking the Right StocksOwing to the month to month volatile figures  investment in the

uphill task to pick the right stocks for greater investment rewards amid worries  This is where our  comes in handy We have shortlisted construction stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2

24183,245698,MHO,Homebuilder Confidence Hits 7 Month High In May  4 Top Picks,opinion,Homebuilders  confidence in May climbed to its highest level in seven months  according to the report released by the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  on Wednesday According to the report  Housing Market Index  HMI  reading climbed to 66 in May from 63 in April  sustaining this year s upward momentum  on declining mortgage rates  moderating home prices and higher home sales  Although the May reading is lower than the year ago level of 70  it is the highest reading since October  Notably  any reading of more than 50 signals improving conditions Encouragingly  three HMI components grew in May  A gauge of present sales conditions increased three points to 72 from April  Buyer traffic rose two points to 49 while sales prediction for the next six months inched up by one point to 72 Regionally  on a three month moving average  sentiment in the Northeast jumped six points to 57  in the West  it rose two points to 71  in the Midwest it was up one point to 54 and in the South  it increased one point to 68 NAHB Chairman  Greg Ugalde noted   Builders are busy catching up after a wet winter and many characterize sales as solid  driven by improved demand and ongoing low overall supply   However  he added that affordability challenges remain an impediment to home sales Declining Mortgage Rates   Strong Demand Raise HopeMortgage rates have moderated after a month long climb  according to Freddie Mac s latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey  The 30 year fixed mortgage averaged 4 1  for the week ending May 9  down from 4 14  the previous week and 4 55  a year ago Market pundits remain optimistic and believe that low mortgage rates  accompanied with a strong job market and modest wage growth should spur buyers  interest this spring Notably  sales of new homes in the United States jumped to a 16 month high in March  marking the third straight monthly increase  Sales of newly constructed single family homes  accounting for roughly 10  of all U S  home sales  grew 4 5  from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692 000 units last month   the highest level since November 2017 At the same time  existing home sales  which make up about 90  of the market  dropped in March for the fourth time in five months  while new home construction declined to the slowest pace since May 2017 Indeed  lower rates and higher incomes have lifted housing activity in the recent times  However  ongoing land and labor shortages and rising material costs are pressing concerns  On top of it  the trade war with China is gradually heating up  thus limiting the possibility of negotiations  This has increased challenges for the industry players  On May 9  the Trump administration raised tariffs from the existing 10  to 25  on  200 billion in Chinese made products That said  the easing of housing market pressure in recent times along with a strong economy should lead to strong demand going forward 4 Top Ranked Homebuilding Stocks to Bet OnWe have zeroed in on four homebuilding stocks with solid potential  These are worth investing in despite the

24207,245722,MHO,Zacks com Featured Highlights Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  American Equity Investment Life Holding  Magna International And M I Homes,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 28  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  Aktiengesellschaft  OTCMKTS    OTC VLKAY        Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V   NYSE    NYSE FCAU        American Equity Investment Life Holding Company  NYSE    NYSE AEL        Magna International Inc   NYSE    NYSE MGA       and M I Homes  Inc   NYSE    NYSE MHO       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Bargain Stocks with Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios Price to earnings  P E  is among the most preferred valuation metrics in the investment toolkit for working out the fair market value of a stock  The idea of hunting for stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many value investors  However  even this simple  easy to calculate valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations  Is EV EBITDA a Better Option While P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings   also known as the enterprise multiple  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In essence  it is the entire value of a company EBITDA  the other component  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is  takes a more complete approach to valuation  It takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks sporting low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another major drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is less susceptible to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses Then again  EV EBITDA has its shortcomings too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is

24218,245733,MHO,Here s Why You Should Add U S  Concrete  USCR  Right Now,opinion,Shares of U S  Concrete Inc    NASDAQ USCR    a provider of ready mixed concrete and concrete related products and services  rallied 12 4  since Harvey wreaked havoc on Aug 25  Demand for building materials for the repair of damaged properties is expected to increase  thus boosting the top line for building material companies Also  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company has solid prospects and should make a valuable addition to your portfolio  Let us delve deeper into the other factors which make this stock a lucrative pick Earnings History and Future EstimatesU S  Concrete has remarkably beaten earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  recording average beat of 60 6  Furthermore  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 0 2  over the last 60 days  while next year s earnings estimates rose 1 9   Again  the company has a long term  3 5 years  expected EPS growth of 10   These positive earnings estimate revisions show analysts  confidence in the stock Stock Price   Other ReturnsShares of U S  Concrete have returned 13 1  so far this year  comparing favorably with its  gain of 3 3   That said  we have noticed that the company has outperformed the industry in each of 4 week  12 week and 52 week time frames Furthermore  the Return on Equity delivered in the trailing 12 months is around 20 2   while the industry returned 7 7   reflecting the company s efficiency in using shareholders  funds Valuation Looks RationalU S  Concrete has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this perspective The company currently has a trailing 12 months Price to Earnings  P E  ratio of 23 4  while the industry s average stands at 24 9  Moreover  its forward P E ratio  price compared to this year s earnings  is lower at 20 66  This indicates that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for U S  Concrete Looking at the company s sales  the company currently trades at a Price to sales  P S  ratio of 0 9  significantly lower than the S P 500 average of 3 1  Some prefer this metric more than other value focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health of a business  U S  Concrete has a P CF of 12 7  lower than the industry s average of 19 All these ratios show that the company is undervalued in comparison to its industry peers and thus it a good time to place a bet on the stock Earnings   Revenue GrowthU S  Concrete makes a great pick in terms of growth investment   The company has put up a historical EPS growth rate  average trailing 12 month EPS growth rate over the last 3 5 years of actual earnings  of 64 9   compared with the industry average of 20 5  For 2017  the company s earnings are likely to grow 44 9   while its industry s average calls for just 30 3  growth Meanwhile  consolidated revenues for the first six months of 2017 increased 22 9  driven by higher volume and pricing in both ready mixed concrete and aggregate products  Notably  the company s sales growth in 2017 is projected at around 18 7  For all these reasons  the company currently has a Growth Score of B on our that helps us identify potential outperformers Bottom LineU S  Concrete is expected to perform well in the quarters ahead  given its strong fundamentals  Moreover  the company s  of B coupled with a Zacks Rank  2 makes for a solid investment choice The company also plans to continue to boost organic growth through expansion in existing markets  It is also focused on expanding its ready mixed concrete and aggregate products platforms and entering into new major metropolitan areas through acquisitions Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top ranked stocks in the sector include Beazer Homes USA  Inc    NYSE BZH    M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO   and KB Home   NYSE KBH   KB Home  a Zacks

24219,245734,MHO,Is A Dip In July Pending Home Sales Sign Of Soft Housing ,opinion,Pending home sales took a turn for the worse in July as it fell for the fourth time in five months  This was primarily because the U S  housing market witnessed limited options for sale due to intense competition Weakening Housing DataPending home sales  an indicator of the U S  housing market  slipped 0 8  in July from the previous month  per the latest data released by the National Association of Relators or NAR  With this  pending home sales is now 1 3  down from the year ago level and has declined on an annual basis in three of the past four months Pending home sales plunged in all the major regions  barring the west  on a month over month basis  Market analysts are of the opinion that the July decline mostly highlights the ongoing impact of limited supply on the U S  housing market Lawrence Yun  chief economist at NAR  said   The housing market remains stuck in a holding pattern with little signs of breaking through  The pace of new listings is not catching up with what s being sold at an astonishingly fast pace  Meanwhile  existing home sales  which make up a larger part of all the U S  real estate activity  slipped 1 3  last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 4 million  according to the latest report published by the NAR  Although the July figure is still 2 1  higher year over year  the metric still represents a low point for 2017 so far This disappointing existing home sales data reflects the continuing inventory shortage prevailing in the U S  real estate market The NAR group also slashed its expectation for existing home sales this year to 5 49 million from last month s estimate of 5 56 million  Apart from limited supply  the NAR anticipates that the outlook for sales is less promising because purchases in the Houston area is likely to take a toll in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey Softness in the Housing Market Ahead Investors should note that housing starts  permits and completions dropped 4 8   4 1  and 6 2  last month  respectively  New U S  single family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9 4  in July  the lowest level since December 2016 The latest pending and existing home sales data has further added to the weak reports that were released recently in the U S  housing market for July  This could more likely signal toward a soft housing market ahead  This is quite disappointing after the homebuilding industry saw the fastest quarterly home sales in a decade earlier this year and lent some much needed support to the economy Further  with rising U S  home prices  amid a tight supply situation and slow pace of construction  affordability has become a key issue right  The median existing home price in July grew 6 2  from July 2016  July s price increase marks the 65th straight month of year over year gains  Additionally  the median price of a new home increased 6 3  in July from a year ago to  313 700 Homebuilding Losing Ground Land supply has been an ongoing challenge for the housing industry for a while now  Meanwhile  rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels  prevailing economic conditions and interest rates  Although rising interest and mortgage rates  land and labor shortages  and rising material prices raise concerns  the 2017 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market The U S  economy grew faster than anticipated in the second quarter  fastest pace in more than two years  and shows a significant jump from the first quarter s lackluster 1 2  growth  The economy grew at an annual rate of 3  in the April June period  the Commerce Department said in its second estimate on Aug 30 Along with this  solid homebuilders  confidence raises optimism for the entire construction sector  After dipping last month to 64 due to rising material costs  the index increased once again in August to 68 points  according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  Housing Market Index report A few top ranked stocks worth considering in the  space are NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR    Beazer Homes USA  Inc    NYSE BZH    KB Home   NYSE KBH    M I Homes  Inc    NYSE MHO    Meritage Homes Corporation   NYSE MTH   and Persimmon  LON PSN  plc   OTC PSMMY    While NVR sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the other stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Also  the homebuilding industry has returned a lot higher than the S P 500 Index year to date  The industry grew more than 27  in the said period compared with the S P 500 Index s gain of 10 5   Again  the Zacks Industry Rank for homebuilding is currently at  35  top 14   that raises much optimism More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1

declined 1  to 1 9 million homes available for sale  It is also 9  lower than the year ago figure  falling straight for the 26th consecutive months But again  strong demand coupled with low inventory levels is driving home prices thereby boosting revenues for homebuilders  The median existing home price for all housing types in July rose 6 2  from the year ago level  marking the 65th straight month of year over year gains  We believe prices will continue to scale higher as demand for homes is like to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment Good Times Ahead for the Industry The  has outperformed the broader market  S P 500  so far this year  Currently  the industry ranks among the top 18   47 out of 265 industries   Along with the strong past performance of the industry  a solid industry rank signals that companies in the homebuilding space are likely to benefit from favorable factors in the immediate future  There are plenty of factors that are working in favor of the industry which will enhance its prospects in 2017 and beyond The U S  economy grew faster than anticipated in the second quarter  fastest pace in more than two years  and shows a significant jump from the first quarter s lackluster 1 2  growth  The economy grew at an annual rate of 3  in second quarter  according to the second estimate released by the Commerce Department on Aug 30  Steady economic growth along with favorable demographics and historically low interest rates are expected to bolster housing demand further Although the recent bump up in interest rates has raised concerns over the outlook of home prices in 2017  the rates should remain reasonable  keeping housing affordable  Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a positive for the housing sector For 2017  existing home sales are projected to increase 3 5  from 2016 levels  while new single family home sales will rise 10 9  nationally  as per the National Association of Realtors   Promising PicksAmid such a backdrop  it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with compelling prospects  Growth investors look for stocks with aggressive earnings

24298,245813,MHO,Fed Divided On Inflation  5 Stocks To Profit From Easy Rates,opinion,A divide has emerged within the Federal Reserve over the timing of proposed interest rate hikes  according to the minutes of its July meeting  This key economic measure has remained well below the Fed s targeted level of 2  for an extended period  Moreover  the central bank s pet measure of inflation experienced a decline recently  adding to concerns on this count At the same time  the central bank looked united on the need to reduce the size of its balance sheet sooner rather than later  But the key takeaway from this document was Fed policymakers  increased focus on the perils of low inflation levels  This has given rise to uncertainty over the timing and frequency of near term rate hikes  Given such a scenario  investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may continue to be a prudent option Low Core PCE Inflation Raises ConcernsAt the end of last month s meeting  the Fed had opted to leave rates unchanged  a move that gladdened investors  But it now emerges that the decision was preceded by a long conversation on the recent dip in inflation levels  The Fed s preferred inflation gauge  the core PCE inflation index  was flat at 1 5  in June  May s figure also experienced an upward revision  to 1 4  But inflation still remains well below the Fed s desired rate of 2  as well as the 1 8  pace achieved in February  The measure has slowly but steadily experienced a decline since then  which explains the concerns of a section of the Federal Reserve Divide on Inflation EmergesContrary to the Fed Chair s views on this issue  this section of policymakers thinks that inflation may languish below the target level for a period which exceeds current expectations  They also believe that inflation runs the risk of slipping lower in the near future Views of such a nature have led to speculation that the central bank may reduce the pace of its projected rate hikes  Fed minutes show that a section of policymakers believe that the central bank should stay away from further rate increases until it receives conclusive proof that inflation is headed toward the targeted level However  during the meeting  another section of policymakers stated that the Fed could not ignore a labor market near full employment  In July  unemployment once again declined to a 16 year low of 4 3   identical to the pace hit in May  A reluctance to reduce rates at such a point could have costly implications  which may be difficult to deal with later  they said   Inflation to Receive Additional AttentionComments made by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Wednesday are a good illustration of the Fed s current dilemma  Mester clearly said that she was not in favor of waiting to raise rates until the inflation target had been achieved  At the same time  the Fed would have to take into consideration recent poor readings on inflation  she said  Such a view is a far cry from Janet Yellen s recent protestations  depicting inflation weakness as a short term phenomenon  Yellen had attributed this softness to a decline in the cost of prescription medication and cellular fans But July s minutes revealed that Fed s voting members have agreed to watch inflation more closely  A section of policymakers added that the central bank s current mechanism for studying inflation was  not particularly useful  Our ChoicesJuly s Fed Minutes have conclusively proven that worries about inflation are growing within the central bank  This  in turn  is giving rise to a growing reluctance to raises rates in the near term This is why investing in stocks from the utilities  and real estate sectors looks prudent at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of

24307,245822,MHO,5 Bargain Stocks Boasting Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  is among the most preferred valuation metrics in the investment toolkit for working out the fair market value of a stock  The idea of hunting for stocks with a low P E is ingrained in the minds of many value investors  However  even this simple  easy to calculate valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations  Is EV EBITDA a Better Option While P E is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  The ratio is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings   also known as the enterprise multiple  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In essence  it is the entire value of a company EBITDA  the other component  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more enticing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is  takes a more complete approach to valuation  It takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks sporting low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another major drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is less susceptible to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses Then again  EV EBITDA has its shortcomings too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements As such  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities

America and a leading U S  wholesale distributor of building products  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has solid prospects and should make a valuable addition to your portfolio  Let us delve deeper into the other factors which make this stock a lucrative pick Earnings   Revenue GrowthBoise Cascade makes a great pick in terms of growth investment  Arguably  nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects While Boise Cascade has put up a historical EPS growth rate  average trailing 12 month EPS growth rate over the last 3 5 years of actual earnings  of 58 4   compared with the industry average of 23 7   investors should really focus on the projected growth  Here  the company is looking to grow at a rate of 61 4   while the Zacks categorized  industry s average calls for EPS growth of just 26 7  Meanwhile  sales of the company grew 8  in 2016 and 11  in the first quarter of 2017  Notably  the company s sales growth in 2017 is projected to be about 10 5  For all these reasons  the company currently has a Growth Score of  B  on our  that helps us identify potential outperformers Valuation Looks RationalBoise Cascade has a Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this perspective The company currently has a trailing 12 months Price to Earnings  P E  ratio of 24 92  while the industry s average stands at 33 4  Moreover  its forward P E ratio  price compared to this year s earnings  is lower at 17 49  This indicates that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Boise Cascade Looking at the company s sales  the company currently trades at a Price to sales  P S  ratio of 0 29  significantly lower than the industry average of 3 18  Some prefer this metric more than other value focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health of a business  Boise Cascade has a P CF of 9 42  lower than the industry s average of 13 72 All these ratios show that the company is undervalued in comparison to its industry peers and thus it a good time to place a bet on the stock

24392,245907,MHO,5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios To Scoop Up ,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio  given its apparent simplicity  is preferred the most among valuation metrics in the investment toolkit for working out the fair market value of a stock  A widely popular approach is to chase stocks that sport a low P E ratio  However  even this easy to compute  broadly used equity valuation multiple suffers a few pitfalls Why EV EBITDA is a Better Alternative While P E is the most commonly used tool for assessing a firm s value  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA also has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines the total value of a firm as opposed to P E  which considers only its equity portion   EV EBITDA is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In essence  it is the entire value of a firm The other constituent  EBITDA gives the true picture of a firm s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice  also takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  This is the reason why EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  It shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  EV EBITDA  in contrast  is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in assessing the value of companies that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt But EV EBITDA has its downsides too  It alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Thus  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for true value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank

107077,328592,MHO,4 Stocks To Play The Favorable Housing Market Scenario,opinion,The American housing market is in the pink  thanks to the recent slump in mortgage rates following Fed s continuing dovish stance  After all  as borrowing rates decline  potential homebuyers could finally purchase their dream home  Investors could thus consider buying a few construction stocks  which could shine ahead Interest Rates Remain Unchanged  Mortgage Rates DeclineThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday stressed that the economy is in good shape  The central bank held benchmark rates steady  currently in the range of 1 50  1 75   in its first policy setting meeting of this year  keeping its economic outlook almost unchanged as the economy continued with its 12th year of expansion  the longest in history The Fed had cut interest rates thrice last year  a total of 75 basis points   finally arriving at the current rates that have been in place since the latter part of 2019 The major reason behind the central bank keeping its interest rates untouched is the fact that inflation remained well below the bank s target of 2   This is why it is possible that the Fed might lower interest rates in the future instead of raising it Meanwhile  Fed s low rates have supported the American housing market since mortgage rates have also gone down because of it  Should the Fed decide to lower rates further ahead  it would impact mortgage rates as well  dragging the already low figure further down  Thus  attractive borrowing rates definitely aid homebuyer sentiment Per the   the average U S  fixed rate for a 30 year mortgage averaged 3 51  for the week ended Feb 1  dropping to the second lowest level in three years Last but not the least  consumer confidence in the United States rose more than expected in January as the outlook for the current job market improved and optimism around future job prospects rose  The Conference Board s Consumer Confidence Index climbed to 131 6 in January from
