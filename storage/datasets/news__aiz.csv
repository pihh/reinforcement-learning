12129,233644,AIZ,Citigroup To Pay  110 Million In Lawsuit,news,"By    After J P  Morgan  NYSE JPM  and Assurant Inc s  NYSE AIZ   300 million settlement last year  now Citigroup  NYSE C  has been told to pay  110 million in a lawsuit to house owners who were forced to pay expensive property premiums by the bank  The bank has even agreed to refund 8 percent each of force placed flood or wind insurance premiums even though the bank or its affiliates got no commissions on it 
The lawsuit was filed in a New York federal court according to which the plaintiffs were charged a total of  758 million in hazard insurance premiums and  173 million in flood insurance premium  The filing also states that  one of Citigroup s insurance receiving units earned a 15 percent commission during the proposed settlement class period 
As stated in the agreement signed between Citigroup and the plaintiffs  the members who were charged this insurance premium will be given back 12 5 percent of the premium by filing a claim  The agreement has asked the bank to stop accepting commissions for force placed insurance for a period of six years from the effective date of the settlement 
The regulators have been criticizing the banks for such force placed insurances  which are placed by a bank or mortgage lenders to protect interests in a property if the owner s insurance lapses  They have also scrutinized the banks for hiking policy prices without proper commission and reinsurance agreements  though the mortgage agreements give lenders the right to force place insurance 
In August 2012  the Consumer Financial protection bureau had issued mortgage servicing rules to impose such force based insurance products and to get additional disclosures for adjustable rate mortgages  It had said that the servicer for such force placed insurances would have to give an advance notice and pricing information before charging the customers for it  It had added that the servicer will have to terminate the insurance within 15 days if it receives evidence that the borrower already has the necessary insurance  In this case the insurer would have to refund the force placed insurance premiums ",2014-02-08,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citigroup-to-pay-$110-million-in-lawsuit-265222,265222

12155,233670,AIZ,5 Stocks To Consider As New Analysts Initiate Coverage,opinion,Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  helps in interpreting information pertaining to capital markets  creating value for investors  Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might trigger misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  In fact  coverage initiation usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it Notably  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change How Does Analyst Coverage Influence Stock Price The price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual

12158,233673,AIZ,Why Assurant  AIZ  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Assurant  NYSE AIZ  in Focus
Assurant  AIZ  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 33 53  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 6 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 01   In comparison  the Insurance   Multi line industry s yield is 2 38   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 97  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 40 is up 5 3  from last year  In the past five year period  Assurant has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 19 05   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Assurant s current payout ratio is 38   This means it paid out 38  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
AIZ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  8 76 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 51 03  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AIZ presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-08-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-assurant-aiz-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200458635,200458635

12165,233680,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Assurant  NYSE AIZ   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Assurant currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AIZ is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For AIZ  shares are up 1 15  over the past week while the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry is up 2 14  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 25  compares favorably with the industry s 0 89  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Assurant have risen 16 74   and are up 22 59  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 4 17  and 5 75   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to AIZ s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AIZ is currently averaging 579 321 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AIZ 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AIZ s consensus estimate  increasing from  8 59 to  8 76 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that AIZ is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Assurant on your short list ",2019-09-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/assurant-aiz-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200463341,200463341

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that AIZ is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/assurant-aiz-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200453645,200453645
12192,233707,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Assurant  NYSE AIZ   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  119 76 in the previous session  Assurant has gained 33 6  since the start of the year compared to the 10  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 11 2  return for the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 6  2019  Assurant reported EPS of  2 34 versus consensus estimate of  2 13 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 7 68  
For the current fiscal year  Assurant is expected to post earnings of  8 61 per share on  9 67 billion in revenues  This represents a 48 45  change in EPS on a 19 9  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  9 61 per share on  10 19 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 67  and 5 41   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Assurant may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Assurant has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 13 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17 8X versus its peer group s average of 10X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Assurant currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Assurant passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Assurant shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Assurant Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Assurant have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Ping An Insurance Co  of China  PNGAY   Kemper  KMPR   and Cigna  CI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 33  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Assurant  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/assurant-aiz-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200453637,200453637

12195,233710,AIZ,S P 500  Long And Short Of It  S P  Starbucks  Assurant,opinion,"The S P E mini closed the session with a bullish engulfing candle yesterday and has broken to an intraday high in Asia  on the back of positive news on the US China trade negotiations  According to President Trump  China has indicated trade talks are advancing  which raises hopes that a trade deal could be signed in Chile next month 

Still  the S P 500 has reported YoY decline in earnings for a third quarter  which is currently  4 7   Whilst revenues are higher at 2 6   it points towards as squeeze on net profit margins for Q3  So it s not all rosy at the highs 




From a technical standpoint  it trades just 19 points from record highs which has bulls on high alert for a fresh breakout  Yet there s also the potential for this to morph into an ascending triangle  which leaves room for at least another cycle lower  with a higher low or two  before breaking out 
The reward to risk potential is unappealing for bulls  being so close to the all time highs  Therefor  they may want to wait for a break above 3029 50 for even a daily close  before assuming a breakout is underway Bears could also consider fading into any minor rally below key resistance  However  keep in mind this is counter to the long term uptrend so likely carries greater risk 




 Assurant   NYSE AIZ  CFD DFT  Currently around 25  up for the year  this household insurance company has outperformed both the S P500 and financial sector  Structurally  the daily trend is clearly bullish and is on the cusp of breaking to a new 52 week high  The 50 day eMA provided support and marks the potential swing low  and yesterday s gap higher saw it gap out of compression  Given we ve just seen over a month of consolidation at the highs  there are no clear signs of overextension despite it sitting near its record highs 
A clear break  and   or close  above 127 76 assumes bullish trend continuation The trend remains bullish above 121 25  although we could also step aside if momentum reverses and breaks beneath the small doji around 124 46Being near record highs  traders could use an open target if trading the daily timeframeIntraday momentum traders could also monitor this for a break higher  whilst swing traders could wait to see if the 127 76 area holds as support





Starbuck Corp CFD DFT  The price action on Starbucks Corporation  NASDAQ SBUX  has caught our eye  as it s at a technical juncture  From June  18 to July this year  it traded in a very strong  almost parabolic bullish trend  Yet since peaking just below 100  a counter trend move has unfolded with a series of lower lows and highs and its recent pullback has found resistance at the 100 and 20 day eMA s  Furthermore  the 20 day eMA has crossed blow the 100 and the 50 day also points lower  Whilst this would be an appealing setup to bearish swing traders  prices have stalled at the September  18 trendline 
A break of the Sep  18 trendline confirms a resumption of the bearish trend from the 2018 high and target the 83 61 low initially  and the June  18 trendline and the high around 80 Bulls could wait to see if the bullish trendline holds and momentum breaks above the 87 68 high  This would also break back above the 20 and 100 eMA s and create a higher low and higher high Price Action Update  
Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  CFD DFT  After finding support at the prior ATH s around 233  its closed to fresh new highs and keeps the bullish channels very much alive and well  With no clear signs of a top  the trend points high and could be an equity for intraday momentum traders to also consider 
Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  CFD DFT  The Cup and handle pattern could still be in play although  ideally  we should have seen a direct breakout  Instead  Thursday s bearish hammer closed back just below the original breakout level to warn of a hesitancy to break higher  although the overall structure remains bullish  Support has been found at the 20 day eMA  so a break below 51 00 warns of a deeper correction against the dominant trend  and perhaps towards the December trendline   Whereas a break above 53 25 assumes bullish continuation 
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  CFD DFT  A downside break remains the bias as part of a head and shoulders top  whilst prices remain beneath the 48 13 high  Whilst prices have made a half hearted attempt to move higher  momentum lacks conviction  Ultimately  it remains in the watchlist for a larger downside move but we re not on high alert of a sell signal just yet ",2019-10-22,Matt Simpson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sp-500-long-and-short-of-it-sp-starbucks-assurant-200475963,200475963

Business description
Park Group is a specialised financial services business and is the UK s leading provider of multi retailer redemption products to the corporate and consumer markets  Consumers can access these products directly through its market leading Christmas Savings offering  Corporate customers use these products to supply a range of incentive and reward products  often tailor made 
Good momentum in core offering
Billings grew 3 4  to  426 9m or c 5  adjusted for  6 2m of discontinued low margin business  while higher value  core multi retailer billings grew 6 3  with cards particularly strong  IFRS 15 effects related to the growing share of multi retailer product and cards in particular held back reported revenues and gross profit  with net profit deferral into future accounting periods increasing to c  1 2m from  0 3m in the prior year  Adjusted PBT of  12 5m  FY18   12 6m  is before the previously disclosed  1 2m property impairment  and if adjusted for profit deferral  one off pensions costs   0 3m  and strategic development costs   0 5m    underlying PBT  would have been considerably higher and well above the prior year  With total cash balances continuing to grow and a debt free balance sheet  DPS grew 5  
Investing for faster medium term growth
Management expects similar top line trends in the current year and continues to guide to implementation costs for the strategic business plan of c  2 0m  net of cost savings achieved   This includes the income statement impacts from significantly increased capex  Our FY20 forecasts are little changed  other than the assumption of a pause in DPS growth given the capex requirements  and we introduce an FY21 forecast  which includes reduced net investment costs and further top line growth but does not capture the medium term strategic business plan benefits  Management targets P L benefits of  2 5m pa after FY21 
Valuation  Attractive yield and medium term growth
Our modified DCF valuation is unchanged at 90p  but now incorporates a two stage  long term growth assumption to capture the benefits of the strategic investment  see page 15   With near term earnings suppressed by investment spend  the implied CY20e P E at 90p is 18 0x and CY21e 16 2x  which we believe is reasonable 
Investment summary
Company description  Building on strengths
Park has a strong track record of profitable growth and product development  and is supported by a strong  liquid  debt free balance sheet  It is the UK s leading provider of multi retailer redemption products  a market that is large and growing  while fragmentation provides ample scope for market share gains  Having undertaken a business review  the new management team assembled over the past year is implementing a strategic business review aimed at building on the group s existing strengths and market positioning to accelerate growth  and improving efficiency by enhancing its products  providing product and branding clarity  and investing in its core infrastructure with a particular focus on increased digitalisation 
Financials  Investing for growth
FY19 saw good underlying progress in Park s core multi retailer redemption offering  and through the business to business  B2B  channel  We expect these trends to continue over the next two years  although the current  FY20  year will be affected by implementation costs for the strategic business plan  We expect further investment costs in FY21  but at a reduced level and supporting FY21 profit growth  Management targets a payback period of no more than three years from the investments planned and from 2021 onwards  effectively affecting FY22 and outside our forecasting period  aims for  2 0 5 0m pa in income statement benefits  Park s business model generates strong operational cash flow  and it has a liquid and debt free balance sheet to support its investment plans  Given the scale of the investment  we forecast a pause in dividend growth in FY20 before growth resumes in FY21 
Valuation  Attractive yield and medium term growth
Our approach to valuing Park is to consider a potential absolute valuation  based on a modified DCF analysis  alongside a relative value based on a comparison with a selected group of listed stocks which are engaged in activities that provide some overlap with Park  Our DCF value is unchanged at 90p  although we have introduced an intermediate stage of growth to capture the benefits of the strategic business plan investment  Given that our near term forecasts are suppressed by investment spending and capture none of the benefits  it is difficult to attach a target multiple  but we note that the 90p DCF value implies P E multiples  18 0x CY20 and 16 2x CY21  that appear reasonable in the context of the comparator stocks  Meanwhile  Park offers an attractive yield approaching 5  with dividends well covered by earnings and supported by a strong debt free balance sheet

UK leader in multi redemption cards and vouchers
Park Group is a UK based  specialised financial services business  and is the UK s leading provider of multi retailer redemption products  cards  vouchers and e codes  to the corporate and consumer markets  The UK market is large  the UK Gift Card   Voucher Association estimates c  6bn per year  and growing  while fragmentation provides ample scope for market share gains 
Customers access Park products directly in the business to consumer  B2C  channel through the Park Christmas Savings and the online highstreetvouchers com brands  while the business to business  B2B  access brand Love2shop Business brand provides similar products to business  primarily for customer and employee incentives and rewards programmes  Park s own in house  multi retailer redemption products are the core of its offering  accepted by a wide range of carefully selected retail partners  and account for the overwhelming majority of billings  c 85  of the total in FY19   It also offers third party sourced single retailer products  eg M S gift cards   a range of goods  hampers and other merchandise  and provides various services  eg software as a service  
For the group as a whole  the majority of sales are generated online  which complements and supports traditional distribution through a direct salesforce and agents  Most income is generated from the service fees paid to Park by partner retailers  leisure and other service providers  based on the face value of money spent in their outlets  Interest is earned on all prepaid cash until the obligation to the redeemers has been settled 
Park has a cash generative business model  a debt free balance sheet and a good track record of profitable growth  supporting a progressive dividend policy  This is a very positive starting point for the new senior management team to build on  The new strategy that was presented in December 2018  following a comprehensive review of the business  has identified a number of opportunities to accelerate growth and improve efficiency  The core multi retailer redemption offering  where the scale of the market provides significant potential  will be given even greater focus and the digitalisation of the business will be accelerated to enhance the attractiveness  accessibility  reach and delivery of existing products  tap new market segments and areas of demand  and enhance efficiency 

In the following section  we review Park s business model and strategy  including a discussion of IFRS 15 accounting  Readers already familiar with the company may wish to go to page 9 where we review the recently released FY19 results  followed by an update on our financial forecasts and valuation 
Business model and strategy
Hampers to fintech
As a multi million pound leader in the UK multi retailer redemption market  the Park of today is unrecognisable from its origins as a Christmas hamper supplier  established in 1966  and run out of the family butchery chain of founder Peter Johnson  who retired as chairman in 2016  Over the years  Park first introduced multi retailer redemption vouchers into the Christmas savings business  in the 1980s   an attractive and convenient alternative to hampers for customers  and later expanded its distribution by entering the corporate  B2B  market  The 2010 introduction of FCA authorised prepaid cards  supported by the in house developed  flexecash  card engine  marked the start of the group s further evolution towards the electronic and digital product that now accounts for a little more than half of core billings 
Exhibit 3  Product split  FY19  

The specialised financial service business of today
Exhibit 4 provides a pictorial summary of the group and its business model  Consumers have traditionally accessed Park products directly through the Christmas savings offering  but in recent years have increasingly done so through the fast growing highstreetcouchers com  hsv com  website  Park is the UK market leader in Christmas savings  accounting for 92  of FY19 Consumer business billings  and operates in the UK under the Park  Family and Country brands and in Ireland under the Park Ireland brand  Christmas savings customers purchase its own multi retailer redemption products  third party retailer cards and vouchers  hampers and other goods  typically on a 45 week prepaid instalment plan  which offers them a way to budget for Christmas and a relatively convenient way of shopping  Customers and agents are typically recruited from September October onwards for orders that will be fulfilled in Christmas of the following year and as a result  the first half of the financial year is loss making  with most revenues and all of the profits generated in the second half  Many customers still prefer to deal with Park via agents  we estimate a little more than half   although a growing share of customers deal directly with Park  encouraged by its ongoing investment in e commerce and mobile enablement  and use of social media  The 1 8  decline in Christmas 2018 customers to c 428k obscures the success in attracting a record c 60k new direct accounts  substantially offsetting the steady attrition of agency customers  which mirrors other agency distribution business  The strategic plan includes a number of initiatives aimed at improvements in both products and customer experience that are designed to support further growth in direct customers as well as supporting the agency channel 
The hsv com website served 133k other  ie non Christmas savings  consumer customers in FY19  up 10  on the previous year  Unlike Christmas savings  purchases are more  ad hoc  and spontaneous  and average order sizes are smaller with shorter duration customer cash balances on which to earn interest 
Exhibit 4  Park Group business model

Consumers are also provided with Park products indirectly through the corporate access brand Love2shop Business  The Corporate business provides c 37k businesses with primarily customer and employee incentive  recognition and rewards products  and packages based on the broad Park product offering  Park estimates that c 2m individual recipients receive its products indirectly through the B2C channel  for redemption with retail and other partners  The core incentive and rewards product has shown strong growth over a number of years  although progress at the divisional level has been tempered by reductions in other areas such as sales to the home collected credit sector and intermediaries  This underlying growth has been supported by ongoing product investment and the development of flexible online platforms  The customer base has typically been  SME  in nature  although larger businesses are increasingly being targeted 
Park s own multi retailer redemption products are provided under the Love2shop brand  the UK s leading multi retailer gift card and prepaid card brand  with high levels of customer awareness  The voucher is accepted by almost 200 retail and other partners in more than 25 000 outlets  while the card  requiring additional connectivity  is accepted in a more focused subset of this group  Historically  the multi redemption product has operated within the  closed loop  network of retail partners from which it receives service fees  However  in 2016 Park began to sell a Mastercard  NYSE MA  product  for  open loop  use at a broader range of outlets and for which customers have proved willing to pay a premium for the added flexibility 
In addition to Park s own multi retailer redemption offering  customers also purchase Park hampers and other third party merchandise  and third party single retailer cards and vouchers  Corporate customers also pay consultancy and service fees in respect of incentive rewards programmes provided by Park 
A key performance indicator for the group is billings  a non statutory measure of customer activity  which represents the gross value of vouchers  cards  and other goods and services provided  This is our preferred measure of  sales  as  unlike statutory revenues  it is unaffected by changes in business mix between multi retailer redemption product and other goods and services  including single retailer cards  vouchers and e codes 
Revenues for the core multi retailer redemption products are reported  net   representing the service fee received by Park from the partner retailer when the card  voucher or e code is redeemed  as well as cardholder fees and breakage  also recognised in line with redemption  Cardholder fees are levied  at card expiry  on unspent balances in respect of cards where the holder has a right of redemption  Breakage relates to the recognition of unspent balances on vouchers and cards where the holder has no right of redemption  The introduction of IFRS 15 for the first time in FY19 brought voucher reporting  previously on a  gross  basis  into line with cards and greatly reduced reported revenues but not ultimate profitability  ie excluding timing recognition effects   Because revenues are reported net  there is no cost of sales and gross margin is therefore 100  
Revenues for single retailer redemption products and other goods and services continue to be reported on a gross basis  representing the gross value of goods and services shipped and invoiced to customers in the period  The reported gross margin  after cost of sales  is significantly lower than that reported for multi retailer redemption product 
A more detailed explanation of the impact that IFRS 15 has had on the financial statements can be found on page 17  It is important to note that cash flow and ultimate profitability were unaffected by the new accounting standard 
Strategic opportunities to accelerate growth
The strategic review undertaken by the new management team during the second half of 2018 and communicated to the market in December 2018 recognises the group s significant historical development in multi retailer redemption products  where it is the leader in a fragmented UK market  and its good track record of profitable growth  but concluded that there is much that the group can do to improve its current offering and performance  and there is significant untapped market potential still to be addressed  Feedback from this customer review showed that there is a strong appetite for the multi retailer product in the market and that Park is generally well regarded by its own customers  but with upside potential to increase revenues and efficiency from improving and simplifying the product range  as well as how the products can be bought and used  Market analysis indicates there is untapped potential in the  2bn  consumer market for multi redemption cards and vouchers in which it is currently only modestly represented 
Significant market opportunity
The UK Gift Card   Voucher Association  an industry trade body  estimates that the UK market has shown double digit annual growth over the past five years to reach more than  6bn  It estimates that growth in the second half of 2018 was 11 7   up from 8 7  in the first half  Within this overall market growth there is a significant trend shift in the mix of product formats with cards  and to an even greater extent digital  growing strongly and increasing share at the expense of paper vouchers  This trend is not new  and Park has been investing in its card and digital capabilities over many years  However  the new management team intends to push this transformation harder to support growth in existing markets  open new markets and improve efficiency 

Further analysis of the marketplace highlights a particular opportunity from addressing the broader consumer market for a multi redemption product  alongside Park s existing dominant position in the Christmas savings consumer segment and strong positions in the corporate market segments  Exhibit 6   Park believes that enhancements to its product offering are also likely to strengthen its appeal to business customers 

Strategic business plan initiatives and actions
Park s strategic business plan and investment is aligned with industry growth and the strong trend towards card and digital delivery  In brief  the four pillars of the strategy  with more details below  are

Appeal  Park wants to broaden its customer appeal to drive faster growth  including the launch of new product targeting a broader customer base  It has already expanded its e code and virtual card offering  is exploring opportunities to establish an in store gift card  and is reviewing its marketing practices with the goal of getting better value for the money that it spends 
Clarity  The core multi retailer redemption offering has been given even greater focus  with a simplified product range  faster migration from paper to card  and a review of the brand architecture  To provide focus  the hamper production operation has been separated out and management structures have been realigned to better co ordinate the key functions of customer management  consumers  businesses and retailers   and product and marketing 
Experience  Park recognises the potential from being easier to work with for all its customers  consumers  business customers and retailer partners 

Relocation well advanced
The group is in the process of moving the majority of its core operations to new offices in Liverpool s city centre  fulfilment and redemption activities will remain at the current site  along with separated hamper production   The existing site is effectively industrial  with scattered office buildings that are inappropriate to support efficient  creative and collaborative working  The move is also intended to provide the core activities with access to a wider talent pool  benefiting from an existing hub of like minded fintech businesses in central Liverpool  Management anticipates that productivity improvements and the potential sale or subletting of vacated space should substantially mitigate the cost of the move and accelerate the payback period 
Accelerated digitalisation
Park has accelerated its IT investment in both back office functions and digital capability in order to improve both efficiency and functionality  In the near term  investment in digital enablement will see enhanced app capability  new mobile digital enablement and new personalised e delivery of e codes  An immediate goal is to be able to offer full digital enablement across the product range  integrated to support contactless and mobile wallets for consumers  Over the medium term  management would like to reach a point where digital products are the default  with paper vouchers and cards providing support as demanded by consumers  rather than representing separate product lines  If achieved  the ease of use for the consumer would be greatly enhanced  With the technology in place  it should also be possible to develop a common list of retailers redeemers across payment methods  and also to provide valuable analytical feedback to the retailers 
New consumer product
The group continues to work on the details of a new product targeting a substantial share of the  2bn  consumer market for multi redemption cards and vouchers in which it is currently only modestly represented  The process is still at a relatively early stage and management has given few details as yet  It is expected that a prototype will soon be completed and that market testing will commence later in 2019  The intention is to build on existing strengths  while more effectively targeting a broader demographic than the current Christmas savings business and will initially focus on gifting  Recognising market trends and the fact that by 2020 half of the workforce will be millennials  the product is expected to be digitally enabled and allow for greater personalisation so as to make the gifting process a more rewarding experience for the consumer  It seems likely that the profitability of the product will continue to be driven by retailer service fees and interest earned on customer balances  although compared with Christmas savings these balances may be of shorter duration and potentially more variable 
Strategic plan financials
Management has not changed its previous guidance that the implementation costs for the strategic business plan will negatively affect the current  FY20  year by  2 0m  net of savings that are already being achieved  This includes  1m of investment in the new consumer market product   0 8m in temporary overlapping property costs resulting from the relocation of the core operations  and  1 0m in technology related costs  offset by cost benefits of  0 8m realised during the year 
Additional IT capex to support implementation of the strategic plan is expected to be c  4 0m over the next two years  with a three year payback period  Property capex related to the migration of the core activities to central Liverpool will generate  1 5m of property capex in the current  FY20  year  but management expects the disposal of redundant property assets to generate proceeds of c  5 0m in FY21 
Income statement benefits of  2 0 5 0m are targeted by management from 2021 onwards  effectively emerging from FY22  This expectation is based on 

reduced costs of paper vouchers and related overheads 
improved margins from the mix shift to card  code and virtual products 
operating efficiencies from the office move  offsetting rental costs  and
incremental customers and revenues as a result of the new product  once launched 

Management and governance
A substantially new senior management team has been assembled over the past year or so  led by chief executive Ian O Doherty  who joined Park in January 2018  He brings a strong background in financial services  specifically in banking  payments and card services  which appears well suited to leading the continued development of the business  Prior to joining Park  his experience includes 25 years at MBNA  most recently as chairman and CEO of MBNA in the UK  where he oversaw the reorganisation of the business and the re engineering of its digital capabilities  The new CFO  Tim Clancy  took up his post in August 2018  joining Park from Assurant  NYSE AIZ  Europe  the European subsidiary of Assurant  the US listed global insurance provider  where he had held the role of chief financial officer since 2013  That role has included overseeing several acquisitions in the UK and Europe and their integration into the group  Other important appointments have been made in the areas of operation and technology  including a new chief information officer  chief transformation officer and head of HR 
Overseeing and steering the group through the changes in management has been the board of directors  comprising five members  led by non executive chairman Laura Carstensen  and including two additional non executive directors in addition to the executive members  the CEO and CFO  Laura Carstensen was elected to the board in September 2013 and became chairman in June 2016  She is a former partner in city law firm Slaughter and May  and a former member and deputy chairman of the UK Competition Commission  now the Competition and Markets Authority   In view of her experience both inside and outside of the group  we welcome the recent announcement that she has agreed to continue in her role for another three years from June 2019  ensuring that she will remain fully involved in guiding the executive team as it continues to implement the strategic business plan 
The other two non executive directors are Michael de Kare Silver  who joined the board in September 2013 and intends to retire by rotation at the 2019 AGM  and John Gittins  who joined the board in September 2016 and has more than 20 years  experience as a CFO across a number of sectors and territories 
Good FY19 progress with the core offering
FY19 results were in line with our expectations and market consensus and showed good underlying progress in Park s core offering of higher value  own branded  multi retailer redemption products  At the headline level  sales were negatively affected by the discontinuance of some low margin business and  although the business mix developments are positive for margin  the deferral of revenue and profit to subsequent reporting periods increased under IFRS 15 accounting  Peak cash flow increased further  maintaining a strong debt free balance sheet and supporting dividend growth 
We discuss the FY19 results in detail below and in the following sections provide a detailed overview of our forecasts and valuation 

The key financial and operational developments for the period were as follows 

Group billings increased by 3 4  to  426 9m  FY18   412 8m   driven by good growth in Corporate with Consumer billings broadly flat 
Corporate billings grew 8 1  to  194 8m  or 46  of the total  despite the discontinuance of  6 2m of low margin third party product through the intermediary channel  Strong growth was achieved in incentive and rewards products  and Park was particularly successful at attracting new larger clients  with revenues from new clients who billed more than  100k increasing fivefold  The total number of corporate clients served by Park increased by 7 5  to just over 37 000 



Reflecting the group s strategy to promote its own branded product  multi retailer billings  cards  vouchers and e codes  increased by 6 3   while third party single retailer billings and other income  hampers and other goods  fees and services  were lower  The share of multi retailer product increased to 84 9  from 82 6  the year before 


Within the mix of multi  and single retailer billings  cards grew strongly  increasing the share of the total to 47 7   FY18  42 3    In underlying terms  adjusting for a  4 3m negative impact as part of the discontinued intermediary business  codes also advanced and paper  vouchers  declined  These mix changes reflect structural changes in the marketplace and the group s strategy  and the higher margin earned on cards is positive for ultimate profitability 


Revenues were marginally lower  down 0 6  to  110 4m  Multi retailer redemption product revenues were strongly ahead  including an increased share of higher value cards and reflecting the trend in billings  However  as these sales are reported on a net basis  the impact was outweighed by the lower revenues from single retailer product  reported on a gross basis  and to a lesser extent the small reduction in other income  The lower revenue on single retailer product includes the effect of the discontinued intermediary business 



The increased share of multi redemption business in the year increased the net deferral of revenues and gross profit in the year  Gross profit reduced slightly  by 0 5  to  31 3m  as the net revenue deferral increased to  1 2m from  0 3m in FY18 
Distribution costs fell slightly despite increased billings  reflecting operational efficiencies made possible by the continued increase in digital product delivery  Administrative expenses rose modestly despite c  0 5m of expenses related to the strategic review undertaken by the new management team  c  0 5m of additional payroll costs relating to the new management team  and a one off pension charge of  0 3m relating to a UK court ruling in respect of guaranteed minimum pensions for males and females  The main offset was a significant reduction in share based payment expenses of c  0 4m 
As previously disclosed  the FY19 results included an exceptional non cash impairment charge of  1 2m due to the write down of the value of its Valley Road site following an external review by property consultants  Much of the site will be surplus to requirement as the group shifts its core business functions and most of its staff to new offices in the centre of Liverpool  and the group is considering the options  which may include a sale and leaseback of those areas still required 
Net finance income benefited from an increase in average cash balances  both the shareholder balance and the segregated customer balances on which Park earns interest  and a slight pick up in interest margin  reflecting firmer short term bank deposit rates  The seasonal  peak  cash balance for the year reached  235 8m  FY18   229 0m  and the average cash balance during the year was  174m  FY18   165m  
Reported PBT was  11 3m compared with  12 6m in FY18  Adjusted PBT  excluding the exceptional charge  was  12 5m  little changed on FY18  Further adjustment for the increased IFRS 15 impact  non recurring pensions costs and strategic development costs suggests an underlying PBT of more than  14m and provides a better indication of the underlying progress in the year 



Net income of  8 9m was 12 8  lower than in FY18 and diluted EPS was 4 77p  The final dividend was declared at 2 15p per share  up 4 9  on the year  making a total dividend for the year of 3 2p  also ahead by 4 9   The continued increase in DPS reflects a good level of earnings cover  a strong liquid and debt free balance sheet  and management confidence for the future 

Forecasting assumptions and estimates
FY19 in line and modest changes to FY20
As noted above  the FY19 results detailed in the section above were very much in line with our estimates  revised after the trading update in late April 2019  and market consensus  Billings were slightly ahead of our expectations and revenues very slightly below due to the IFRS 15 effects being slightly greater than we had allowed for  Adjusted PBT was in line with our estimate  but the tax charge was higher than we allowed for  due to the treatment of the exceptional property impairment  with a small impact on net income and EPS 

We set out our forecasts in detail below  but in summary we have made only a small change to FY20 billings  although our revenue forecast shows a slightly larger adjustment as we continue to refine our forecasting under IFRS 15  We expect Park s own branded  multi retailer redemption product to grow faster than overall billings and this is positive for margins and PBT  forecast marginally increased   The only material change to our FY20 forecasts is that we now assume DPS will be held at the same level as FY19  reflecting the strategic investment spending that will negatively affect PBT by a net c  2 0m  Strategic investment spending will also affect cash flow in FY20  but we expect the shareholder cash balance to remain strong at c  34m 
We also introduce FY21 estimates for the first time  We expect similar underlying trends  with continued growth in billings and the share of multi retailer redemption product  We have not factored in any significant benefit from the strategic investment programme but do expect profitability to benefit from a reduction in net strategic spending 
Key forecasting assumptions
Our key forecasting assumptions include further growth in billings  with a focus on multi retailer redemption products  Under IFRS 15 accounting  we expect this business mix to suppress revenue growth relative to billings growth  but to be positive for profitability  The caveat is that if the multi redemption share of billings is materially stronger than we forecast  this may increase profit deferral into subsequent periods  as was seen in FY19  Specifically  we forecast 

Billings growth driven by Corporate  We look for a slight increase in billings growth during FY20 and FY21  driven by continued growth in Corporate  focused on incentive and rewards products  and modest growth in Consumer  with continued strong growth in direct  hsv com  sales and slight growth in the larger Christmas savings business in FY21  We have not allowed for any material impact from the strategic business plan or any contribution from the planned new consumer product during the forecast period 



Further increase in share of multi retailer redemption and cards e codes  In terms of product mix  in line with management s strategy and market trends  we expect faster growth in Park s own branded  multi retailer redemption product  and within this in cards and e codes  This mix shift is positive for ultimate profitability 



Under IFRS 15  revenues will continue to trail billings  Given the growth that we forecast in multi retailer redemption  reported net  versus single retailer  reported gross   we expect revenues to grow but at a lower rate than billings  Implicit in our assumptions is a broadly stable pattern of redemption activity and we also note that if the share of multi retailer redemption products increases at an even faster rate than we forecast  this will tend to further suppress revenues versus billings 



We expect gross profit to increase at a faster rate than either billings or revenues  This is driven by the increasing share of higher profitability  multi redemption product in our forecast sales mix  reported on a net basis  or effectively a 100  gross margin on revenues  In FY19  the strong increase in growth and share of multi redemption product led to an increase in revenue and gross profit deferral  but our forecasts for a more moderate shift in product mix during FY20 and FY21 indicate a closer balance between new revenue deferral and run off or revenue emergence from prior years  The increase in gross margin that we forecast  both relative to billings and revenues  reflects the mix shift towards higher margin product and implicitly assumes no change in product margins or redemption patterns 



Our forecasts for administrative costs reflect management s guidance of a net  2 0m in strategic business plan implementation costs in FY20  We expect some of this to fall away in FY21  substantially offsetting upward pressure from business growth and inflation in the year 
We expect interest income to grow modestly  driven by continued growth in total cash balances  monies held in trust and shareholder cash   and reflecting order and billings growth  particularly cards  We assume a similar c 0 9  margin on balances to that earned in FY19 
Our shareholder cash flow forecasts reflect the additional IT investment   4 0m over two years  and property investment disposal   1 5m investment in FY20 and  5 0 disposal proceeds in FY21  guided to by management  and the recurring depreciation and amortisation effects are captured in our income statement forecasts ",2019-07-01,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/park-group-results-in-line-and-strategic-plan-taking-shape-200436006,200436006

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Assurant due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Assurant Q4 Earnings and Revenues Surpass EstimatesAssurant reported fourth quarter 2018 net operating income of 77 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 67 4   However  the bottom line deteriorated 58 2  from the year ago quarter  mainly due to higher reportable catastrophe loss Total revenues surged 42 5  year over year to  2 4 billion  mainly attributable to higher premiums earned and net investment income  Moreover  the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 2  Net investment income soared 52 1  year over year to  180 8 million Total benefits  loss and expenses escalated 49 8  to  2 3 billion  mainly on account of a noticeable increase in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses plus interest expense Full Year HighlightsFor 2018  Assurant delivered net operating income of  5 80 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 7   Also  the bottom line improved 45 7  year over year However  total revenues of  8 1 billion missed the consensus mark by 0 1  but grew 28 4  year over year Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing dipped 10 8  year over year to  502 million  primarily due to the sale of mortgage solutions The company incurred net operating loss of  12 4 million against the year ago quarter s net operating income of  89 6 million  This downside can be attributed to higher catastrophe loss  stemming from Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle soared 77 4  year over year to  1 6 billion  This upside was primarily driven by the contribution of Warranty Group s  645 million of revenues Net operating income of  97 9 million skyrocketed 128 7  year over year  The benefit obtained from Warranty Group buyout  lower tax rate and decent organic growth drove the improvement Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed rose 5 2  year over year to  48 3 million  primarily owing to growth in pre funded funeral policies in the United States and Canada along with prior period sales of the Final Need product Net operating income jumped a whopping 256 5  year over year to  16 4 million  mainly on the back of the impact from lower effective tax rate  higher net investment income and the absence of a software impairment in fourth quarter 2017 totaling  5 million Net operating loss at Corporate   Other was  27 5 million  narrower than the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  29 1 million  Absence of a workforce reduction charge in fourth quarter 2017 and better investment results were responsible for this upside  However  adverse impact of the lower effective tax rate partially offset this improvement Financial PositionAssurant s financial position remains strong with around  473 million in corporate capital as of Dec 31  2018 Total assets augmented 29  to  41 1 billion as of Dec 31  2018 from  31 8 billion at 2017 end Total shareholders  equity came in at  5 1 billion  up 19 7  year over year Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn the fourth quarter  the company bought back 0 5 million shares worth  49 million  From Jan 1  2019 onward  through Feb 8  2019  the company repurchased additional 0 2 million shares for  22 million  It now has  739 million remaining under its current share buyback authorization The company s total dividends amounted to  43 million in the fourth quarter 2019 OutlookOn the basis of current market conditions  the company expects Assurant estimates net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe loss  to grow between 6  and 10  from 2018  This earnings growth is likely to be driven by profitability achieved in Global Lifestyle and Global Housing along with share buybacks  This growth rate will comprise an estimated adverse impact of around 2  and the full year impact of the 10 4 million shares issued for the Warranty Group buyout Assurant s consolidated effective tax rate is projected between 23  and 25  Double digit earnings growth is likely to represent full year contributions from the Warranty Group that will include  25  30 million after tax of additional synergy realization  modest organic growth across Connected Living  Global Automotive and multifamily housing along with ongoing expense management efforts  Given a moderate decline in revenues  lender placed insurance excluding reportable catastrophe loss and the incremental reinsurance costs are projected to be around 2018 levels  However  persistent declines in Global Financial Services might partially offset earnings growth Assurant expects full year net operating loss to hover around 2018 levels at Corporate   Other  Additionally  interest expense is projected in the range of  83  85 million and preferred dividends are anticipated to be around  20 million  Both these estimates reflect full year financing costs associated with the buyout of Warranty Group Dividends from the units  namely Global Housing  Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to approximate segment net operating income  including catastrophe loss  The company plans to deploy capital  mainly to fund business growth  finance other investments and return capital to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends

VGM Scores
Currently  Assurant has an average Growth Score of C  however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side  putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Assurant has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/assurant-aiz-up-34-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200397679,200397679
12200,233715,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Assurant  NYSE AIZ  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 30 billion  up 42 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Assurant 
For Assurant  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Assurant will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Assurant would post earnings of  0 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of  67 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

12216,233731,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Assurant  NYSE AIZ  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 5  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  59 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 53 billion  up 11 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Assurant 
For Assurant  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Assurant will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Assurant would post earnings of  2 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 34  delivering a surprise of  9 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

12237,233752,AIZ,Will Assurant  AIZ  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Assurant  NYSE AIZ   This company  which is in the Zacks Insurance   Multi line industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8 82  
For the most recent quarter  Assurant was expected to post earnings of  1 per share  but it reported  1 06 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 89 per share  while it actually produced  2 11 per share  a surprise of 11 64  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Assurant  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Assurant currently has an Earnings ESP of  31 87   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 12  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-assurant-aiz-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200383288,200383288
12238,233753,AIZ,Analysts Estimate Assurant  AIZ  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Assurant  NYSE AIZ  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  75  
Revenues are expected to be  2 31 billion  up 39 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Assurant 
For Assurant  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  31 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Assurant will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Assurant would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 06  delivering a surprise of  6  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line

12239,233754,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Q4 Earnings  What To Expect For The Stock,opinion,Assurant  Inc    NYSE AIZ   is slated to report fourth quarter 2018 results on Feb 12  after the market closes  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive surprise of 6  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Assurant is likely to report bottom line growth in the to be reported quarter  mainly driven by solid organic growth across Global Lifestyle  Housing and Preneed business lines  This probable upside can also be attributed to contributions from The Warranty Group  TWG  buyout along with lower tax incidence  Also  continued share buybacks are likely to boost this expected improvement Riding on the strength of rising interest rates  higher invested assets and business growth  the company is likely to witness better investment results in the soon to be reported quarter Therefore  owing to an anticipated rise in investment income and higher premiums earned  fees and other income  the company will possibly deliver robust revenues in the fourth quarter  To that end  the consensus mark for the metric is currently pegged at  2 3 billion  representing a 39 7  surge from the year ago quarter s tally The company is anticipated to display a strong performance at its Global Lifestyle business in the quarter to be reported  Better than expected organic growth and a substantial contribution from the TWG acquisition have mainly led to this probable uptick  Also  recently introduced mobile programs along with Global Automotive expansion and expense efficiencies are likely to contribute to this improvement Further  the top line at Global Lifestyle is likely to improve in the fourth quarter  fueled by expected growth at Connected Living and Global Automotive With respect to Global Housing  the company is estimated to witness better than expected results  primarily boosted by sustained revenue growth in multifamily housing  realignment of business and implementation of different expense management initiatives across this segment However  the company might have incurred higher expenses  mainly due to a possible increase in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses plus interest expense  This in turn  will perhaps weigh on the property and casualty  P C  insurer s operating margin expansion Being a P C insurer  Assurant is prone to the after effects of catastrophe loss and we expect the fourth quarter to be no exception  Catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Michael are anticipated to range between  75 million and  105 million pretax  Such losses are likely to affect the company s underwriting performance  thereby rendering volatility to its overall results  Nonetheless  the company s consistent commitment to excellence in risk management is projected to mitigate a high level of catastrophe loss  In fact  the aforementioned loss estimate is below the company s cat reinsurance prevent retention of  120 million In the fourth quarter  corporate loss is estimated to increase on a sequential basis due to consistent investments in artificial intelligence  the Connected Home and the Connected Car Despite a strong performance at the Preneed  the company is not too optimistic about this segment s growth in the quarter to be reported due to seasonality and higher mortality What Our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat on earnings this to be reported period  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Assurant has an Earnings ESP of  31 87   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 60 cents  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Assurant  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks Rank  Assurant carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which lowers the predictive power of ESP  We caution against Sell rated stocks  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Given the above combination  surprise prediction for the stock is thus left inconclusive Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the perfect mix of elements to outshine estimates this time around are as follows Ares Capital Corporation   NASDAQ ARCC   is set to report fourth quarter earnings on Feb 12  The company has an Earnings ESP of  1 10  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  AerCap Holdings N V    NYSE AER   has an Earnings ESP of  6 84  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company

12240,233755,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates,opinion,Assurant  Inc    NYSE AIZ   reported fourth quarter 2018 net operating income of 77 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 67 4   However  the bottom line deteriorated 58 2  from the year ago quarter  mainly due to higher reportable catastrophe loss Total revenues surged 42 5  year over year to  2 4 billion  mainly attributable to higher premiums earned and net investment income  Moreover  the top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 2  Net investment income soared 52 1  year over year to  180 8 million Total benefits  loss and expenses escalated 49 8  to  2 3 billion  mainly on account of a noticeable increase in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses plus interest expense Full Year HighlightsFor 2018  Assurant delivered net operating income of  5 80 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 7   Also  the bottom line improved 45 7  year over year However  total revenues of  8 1 billion missed the consensus mark by 0 1  but grew 28 4  year over year Assurant  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing dipped 10 8  year over year to  502 million  primarily due to the sale of mortgage solutions The company incurred net operating loss of  12 4 million against the year ago quarter s net operating income of  89 6 million  This downside can be attributed to higher catastrophe loss  stemming from Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle soared 77 4  year over year to  1 6 billion  This upside was primarily driven by the contribution of Warranty Group s  645 million of revenues Net operating income of  97 9 million skyrocketed 128 7  year over year  The benefit obtained from Warranty Group buyout  lower tax rate and decent organic growth drove the improvement Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed rose 5 2  year over year to  48 3 million  primarily owing to growth in pre funded funeral policies in the United States and Canada along with prior period sales of the Final Need product Net operating income jumped a whopping 256 5  year over year to  16 4 million  mainly on the back of the impact from lower effective tax rate  higher net investment income and the absence of a software impairment in fourth quarter 2017 totaling  5 million Net operating loss at Corporate   Other was  27 5 million  narrower than the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  29 1 million  Absence of a workforce reduction charge in fourth quarter 2017 and better investment results were responsible for this upside  However  adverse impact of the lower effective tax rate partially offset this improvement Financial PositionAssurant s financial position remains strong with around  473 million in corporate capital as of Dec 31  2018 Total assets augmented 29  to  41 1 billion as of Dec 31  2018 from  31 8 billion at 2017 end Total shareholders  equity came in at  5 1 billion  up 19 7  year over year Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn the fourth quarter  the company bought back 0 5 million shares worth  49 million  From Jan 1  2019 onward  through Feb 8  2019  the company repurchased additional 0 2 million shares for  22 million  It now has  739 million remaining under its current share buyback authorization The company s total dividends amounted to  43 million in the fourth quarter 2019 OutlookOn the basis of current market conditions  the company expects Assurant estimates net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe loss  to grow between 6  and 10  from 2018  This earnings growth is likely to be driven by profitability achieved in Global Lifestyle and Global Housing along with share buybacks  This growth rate will comprise an estimated adverse impact of around 2  and the full year impact of the 10 4 million shares issued for the Warranty Group buyout Assurant s consolidated effective tax rate is projected between 23  and 25  Double digit earnings growth is likely to represent full year contributions from the Warranty Group that will include  25  30 million after tax of additional synergy realization  modest organic growth across Connected Living  Global Automotive and multifamily housing along with ongoing expense management efforts  Given a moderate decline in revenues  lender placed insurance excluding reportable catastrophe loss and the incremental reinsurance costs are projected to be around 2018 levels  However  persistent declines in Global Financial Services might partially offset earnings growth Assurant expects full year net operating loss to hover around 2018 levels at Corporate   Other  Additionally  interest expense is projected in the range of  83  85 million and preferred dividends are anticipated to be around  20 million  Both these estimates reflect full year financing costs associated with the buyout of Warranty Group Dividends from the units  namely Global Housing  Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to approximate segment net operating income  including catastrophe loss  The company plans to deploy capital  mainly to fund business growth  finance other investments and return capital to shareholders via share buybacks and

Consensus Estimate by 6   Further  the bottom line reversed the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  1 40 per share  Lower effective tax rate due to the tax cut and a solid performance at Global Lifestyle  Global Preneed and Global Housing segments drove this improvement Assurant  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Total revenues surged 45 6  year over year to  2 3 billion  mainly attributable to higher premiums earned  fees and other income as well as net investment income  Moreover  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 11 5  Net investment income improved nearly 14 5  year over year to  151 8 million Total benefits  loss and expenses increased 29 5  to  2 2 billion  mainly due to a noticeable increase in selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses plus interest expense Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing dipped 1 6  year over year to  521 6 million  primarily due to the sale of mortgage solutions  However  decline in real estate owned volume and anticipated lower placement rates in lender placed insurance partially offset this downside The company reported net operating income of  19 4 million  against the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  110 3 million  This improvement can be attributed to lower catastrophe losses Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle soared 83 1  year over year to  1 5 billion  This upside was primarily driven by the contribution of Warranty Group s  625 9 million of revenues Net operating income of  75 9 million soared 78 2  year over year  The benefit obtained from Warranty Group buyout and organic growth in Connected Living drove improvement Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed grew 7 8  year over year to  48 1 million  primarily due to growth in pre funded funeral policies in the United States and Canada along with prior period sales of the Final Need product Net operating income improved 36 6  year over year to  16 8 million  mainly on the back of the impact from lower effective tax rate Net operating loss at Corporate   Other was  19 million  wider than the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  13 million  Increase in employee related and technology costs along with adverse impact of the lower effective tax rate was responsible for this downside Financial PositionAssurant s financial position remains strong with around  473 million in corporate capital as of Sep 30  2018 Total assets surged 34 1  to  43 4 billion as of Sep 30  2018 from  32 4 billion from the year ago quarter Total shareholders  equity came in at  5 2 billion  up 26 1  year over year Book value per share of  78 92 grew 4 4  from the prior year quarter Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateIn the third quarter  the company bought back 0 8 million shares worth  83 million  From Oct 1  2018 onward  through Nov 2  2018  the company repurchased additional 0 3 million shares worth  34 million  It now has  776 million remaining under its current share buyback authorization  which includes the recently approved  600 million authorization The company s total dividends amounted to  40 million in the third quarter 2018 OutlookOn May 31  2018  Assurant completed the acquisition of The Warranty Group from TPG Capital for a total amount of  2 5 billion  From Jun 1  2018  Warranty Group results  the buyout financing and estimated expense synergies will be reflected in Assurant s operating results as well as its 2018 outlook Warranty Group s operations will be included in Global Lifestyle with certain expenses being allocated to Corporate   Other  Results for the mortgage solutions business  sold on Aug 1  2018  are included in the outlook for periods prior to sale On the basis of current market conditions  the company now expects Assurant estimates net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe loss  to grow between 20  and 25  from the reported results of  413 million in 2017  This earnings growth is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate apart from Warranty Group s contributions and decent organic growth  The company is expected to realize about  10 million after tax of operating synergies from the Warranty Group buyout through the year end Notably  with the sanction of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  TCJA   Assurant s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22 24  from 33  with nearly one third of the savings to be reinvested during the second half of 2018 to support future growth Assurant projects operating earnings per share  excluding catastrophe loss  to grow  reflecting earnings growth and capital management albeit at a slower rate than the net operating income owing to the effect of Warranty Group s share issuance without a full run rate contribution of its income The company expects Global Housing to witness a year over year improvement in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss after taking into consideration the lower tax rate of about 20 21  with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth during the second half of 2018  Meanwhile  net operating income is estimated to decline before considering the benefit of a lower tax rate  Further  the company expects to witness a decline in the ongoing lender placed insurance normalization  However  continued growth in multi family housing is likely to partially mitigate this downside  Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019  Revenues are projected to contract from 2017 levels due to decrease in lender placed and mortgage solutions through July 2018 Fourth quarter 2018 results will take into account losses stemming from Hurricane Michael  During this time  the claims process continues and the company projects pre tax loss estimate to range between  75 million and  105 million  This is below the 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program per event retention of  120 million pre tax Global Lifestyle s net operating income is likely to increase after taking into consideration contributions from Warranty Group  including operating synergies   lower tax rate of about 22 24  and organic growth  A portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth is anticipated to boost results  mainly in the second half of 2018  Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as Global Automotive expansion and expense efficiencies  The ongoing declines in Financial Services will partially offset this probable upside  Moreover  the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive  globally Global Preneed is projected to experience a rise in revenues and earnings  primarily on the back of the company s alignment with market leaders before taking into account the recently enacted tax reform  Lower effective tax rate of about 22   with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  is estimated to enhance results during the second half of 2018 Assurant expects full year net operating loss between  80 and  85 million after considering the negative impact of the lower tax rate of about 20  and higher investments for growth in the fourth quarter at Corporate   Other  Continued expense management efforts will partially offset the loss Dividends from the units  namely Global Housing  Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to be higher than the segment net operating income  including catastrophe loss  owing to the impact of TCJA and Warranty Group s 2018 dividend contributions The company plans to deploy capital mainly to fund the financing and

12253,233768,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Up 5 3  Since Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Assurant  Inc    NYSE AIZ    Shares have added about 5 3  in that time frame 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is AIZ due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Assurant Q1 Earnings   Revenues Top Estimates  Up Y YAssurant reported first quarter 2018 net operating income of  2 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 8   Also  the bottom line improved 6 9  from the year ago period  Lower effective tax rate owing to the tax cut and decent underlying profitable growth in key businesses like mobile business and multi family housing  drove this improvement  However  higher level of net operating loss at the Corporate segment and a substantial catastrophe loss in Global Housing  partially offset this upside Total revenues improved 7 2  year over year to  1 6 billion  mainly attributable to higher premiums earned  fees and other income as well as net investment income  Moreover  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 2  Net investment income improved nearly 8  year over year to  130 2 million Total benefits  loss and expenses increased 12 4  to  1 5 billion  mainly due to a substantial increase in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses and interest expense Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing slid about 1 6  year over year to  523 1 million  primarily due to lower placement rates as well as real estate owned volume in lender placed insurance plus reduction in client demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions  However  sustained growth in multi family housing and higher contributions from international housing products partially offset this downside The company reported net operating income of  71 2 million  which increased 15  from the year ago quarter  This improvement was mainly attributable to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate   Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle improved 14 1  year over year to  918 5 million  This benefit was primarily driven by growth in new and existing mobile protection programs as well as vehicle protection  However  a decline in mobile trade in volumes partially offset the upside Net operating income of  55 8 million rose 6 5  year over year  The upside was driven by the impact of the reduced effective tax rate Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed grew 4 5  year over year to  46 2 million  primarily owing to growth in the United States including prior period sales of the Final Need product Net operating income slipped 1  year over year to  9 8 million  mainly due to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate Net operating loss at Corporate   Other was  20 million  substantially wider than the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  10 1 million  Increases in employee related costs from the year earlier quarter along with the adverse impact of the reduced effective tax rate were responsible for this downside Financial PositionAssurant s financial position remains strong with around  575 million in corporate capital as of Mar 31  2018  Total assets rose 1 8  to  32 4 billion as of Mar 31  2018 from  31 8 billion at year end 2017 Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company did not buy back any shares in the quarter under review The company s total dividends amounted to  30 million in the first quarter 2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe loss  to grow between 10  and 14  from the reported results of  413 million in 2017  The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and a considerable rise in underlying segment earnings  while adjusting for  12 5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items   Declines in lender placed insurance and credit insurance are likely to be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi family housing as well as vehicle protection Notably  with the sanction of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  TCJA   Assurant s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22 23  from 33  with nearly one third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth Assurant projects operating earnings per share  excluding catastrophe loss  to grow in excess of net operating income  representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate  moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management The company expects Global Housing to witness a year over year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform  Further  the company expects to witness a decline in the ongoing lender placed insurance normalization and mortgage solutions  However  continued growth in multi family housing is likely to partially offset this downside  Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019  Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20 21  with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  Revenues are projected to be close to 2017 levels as decrease in lender placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi family housing and mortgage solutions Global Lifestyle s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform  Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as vehicle protection expansion and expense efficiencies  The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside  Lower effective tax rate of 22 24  with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  is anticipated to boost results  Moreover  the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection  globally Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings  mainly on the back of the company s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform  Lower effective tax rate of about 22  with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  is estimated to enhance results Assurant expects full year net operating loss to be close to 2017 s loss of  63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate   Other  The loss will likely increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20  Dividends from the units  namely Global Housing  Global Lifestyle and Global Preneed are predicted to be higher than the net operating income  including catastrophe loss  owing to the implementation of TCJA

12255,233770,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ    Units Downgraded By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,Moody s Investors Service  a subsidiary of Moody s Corporation  recently gave ratings to Assurant  Inc    NYSE AIZ   and its property and casualty  P C  as well as life insurance operating subsidiaries  This rating action followed the closure of Assurant s buyout of The Warranty Group from TPG Capital for about  2 5 billion  The credit rating giant downgraded Assurant s senior debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2 while for its P C operating subsidiaries  the rating agency downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings to A3 from A2 and from A3 to Baa1 for its life insurance subsidiaries  The outlook for these ratings remained stable Ratings Representation of Assurant and its UnitsAssurant s substantial increase in financial leverage together with higher levels of goodwill and intangibles are reflected by the ratings downgrade  Moody s projects consolidated financial leverage  on a pro forma basis  to increase approximately 28   up from 22 6  from year end 2017  However  the rating giant mentioned that the company s financial leverage on the basis of tangible equity is likely to be much higher The buyout of The Warranty Group is likely to widen Assurant s market presence in vehicle service contracts  apart from boosting its geographic diversification and achieving substantial savings through expense synergies  But the company s exposure to catastrophe loss will render volatility to both earnings and capital The downgrade of insurance financial ratings for Assurant s life insurance units  American Bankers Life Assurance Co of Florida and Union Security Insurance Company  is in line with the rating actions on Assurant  With the stable outlook  the rating agency anticipates that Assurant will continue to deliver better than expected results  especially on the back of a lower tax incidence  which is likely to boost the company s bottom line  considerably in the near future   Solid market position amongst a number of niche  specialty P C insurance markets forms the basis of the Multi line insurer s ratings However  considerable cat loss exposure plus a modest scale and susceptibility to adverse changes with respect to legal and regulatory environment are likely to offset the aforementioned strengths Factors Leading to an Upgrade or DowngradeThe factors that could lead to a ratings upgrade include a noticeable reduction in gross and net catastrophe exposures  consolidated financial leverage meaningfully lying below 25  on a sustained basis  better capitalization and solid profitability on a continued basis as well as parent company liquid resources around  500 million On the flip side  the factors that might lead to a downgrade are a considerable rise in catastrophe exposure  on gross or net basis  as a percentage of shareholder equity or a 10  or more decline in shareholder equity  consolidated financial leverage above 35  on a sustainable basis  earnings coverage of interest lower than 4x for an extended period and parent company liquid resources much below  250 million Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence as well as in maintaining credit worthiness of a stock  On the other hand  rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently  Assurant carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Shares of Assurant have lost 6 7   narrower than the  s decrease of 8 8   We

Further  the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  which continued in third quarter fiscal 2018  Also  results improved year over year  While bottom line results were aided by productivity cost savings  top line was driven by organic sales growth and higher volumes  
Management remains focused on product improvement  packaging and marketing initiatives  and productivity cost savings plan  The company is witnessing strained margins owing to increased commodity costs  adverse geographic and product mix as well as unfavorable pricing impacts and product reinvestments  Also  slower global market growth along with softness across Baby  Feminine and Family Care segment remains concerns

Moreover  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases  Mavyret s launch has been stronger than expected  Mavyret has become a major growth driver for AbbVie in a short time on the market  
AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline with label expansions for both new and existing products expected over the next few years  Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018  
Promising data from several pivotal studies and settlement of its second Humira patent dispute with Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  are other tailwinds  However  Viekira s sales continue to be hurt by intensifying competition  Also  potential long term competition to Humira is a concern

Further  expanding footprint in the rapidly growing blockchain market is positive  The expanded partnership with Red Hat bodes well for the company in the long haul  Oniqua buyout will add asset optimization capabilities IoT based capabilities to aid IBM s Maximo  IBM has positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  
However  the strategic imperatives will take some more time to report meaningful growth and offset weakness in the traditional business  IBM s ongoing heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud continues to hurt the stock  Additionally  intensifying competition is a major concern  Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company s Q2 earnings release

12261,233776,AIZ,Assurant  Inc   AIZ  Q3 Earnings  Is A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,Assurant  Inc    NYSE AIZ   is slated to report third quarter 2018 results on Nov 6  after the market closes  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11 64  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Assurant is likely to report bottom line growth in the to be reported quarter  mainly driven by solid organic growth across Global Lifestyle as well as Housing business lines  This probable upside can also be attributed to contributions from The Warranty Group  TWG  buyout along with lower tax incidence  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at  1 per share versus the year ago quarter s loss per share of  1 40   Also  continued share buybacks are likely to boost the possible improvement On the back of rising interest rates  the company might experience better investment results in the soon to be reported quarter  Therefore  owing to an anticipated rise in investment income as well as higher premiums earned  fees and other income  the company is expected to deliver robust revenues in the third quarter  To that end  the consensus mark for the metric is currently pegged at  2 billion  representing a 30 5  surge from the year ago quarter s tally The company is anticipated to display a strong performance at its Global Lifestyle business in the quarter to be reported  Better than expected organic growth and a substantial contribution from the TWG acquisition have mainly led to this probable improvement  Also  the company might have experienced margin expansion owing to a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies worldwide Further  the top line at Global Lifestyle is likely to improve in the third quarter  fueled by sustained profitable growth in its vehicle protection business  driven by a probable higher sales volume With respect to Global Housing  the company is estimated to witnessed better than expected results  primarily boosted by probable multifamily housing earnings and revenue growth as well as a favorable loss experience in lender placed The company is likely to generate solid revenues and earnings growth in its multi family housing business  mainly attributable to the growing number of insured renters  currently having over 1 9 million insured renters  However  the company might have incurred higher expenses  mainly due to a possible increase in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses plus interest expense  This in turn  will perhaps weigh on the property and casualty  P C  insurer s operating margin expansion Also  as a P C insurer  Assurant is prone to the after effects of catastrophe loss and we expect the third quarter to be no exception  A probable incurrence of catastrophe loss might affect the company s underwriting performance  thereby rendering volatility to its overall results  Nonetheless  the company s consistent commitment to excellence in risk management is projected to mitigate a high level of catastrophe loss What Our Quantitative Model StatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat on earnings this to be reported period  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP  Assurant has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at  1 per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Assurant  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Zacks Rank  Assurant carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the finance sector with the right combination of elements to exceed estimates this time around are as follows National Health Investors  Inc    NYSE NHI   is set to report third quarter earnings on Nov 6 and has an Earnings ESP of  0 24   The company is a Zacks  2 Ranked player  You can see  TCG BDC  Inc    NASDAQ CGBD   has an Earnings ESP of  1 65  and a Zacks Rank of 2  The company is set to release third quarter earnings on Nov 6 Prudential Financial  Inc    NYSE PRU   has an Earnings ESP of  0 13  and is a  2 Ranked stock  The company is set to announce third quarter earnings on Nov 7 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at

What s Next for Assurant 
While Assurant has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

12294,233809,AIZ,The Navigators Group Counts Cat Loss Estimates  Shares Slip,opinion,"Shares of The Navigators Group  Inc    NASDAQ NAVG   have slid 1 8  in the last three trading sessions after the company announced expected catastrophe loss estimates emanating from Hurricane Harvey  Irma and Maria and two Mexican tremors  The company anticipates to incur catastrophe loss of  50  70 million pre tax   33  45 million after tax  in the third quarter 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 65 cents per share  reflecting a year over year decline of 7 1   We expect the estimates to move downward as analysts incorporate impact of catastrophe losses 
Despite challenging market conditions  in 2016  the company had delivered underwriting profits for the fifth year with a combined ratio of 96 7   However  underwriting profit plunged 38 2  compared with 2015 as the International Insurance underwriting segment was adversely affected by North American exposures underwritten at Lloyd s  The recent catastrophe events are expected to weigh heavily on the company s underwriting income  draining its margins in the process   
Third quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss  Mass devastation rampaged parts of the United States  which again bore the brunt of a slew of hurricanes and ravages of successive tremors 
While Harvey shook Houston and Texas Gulf Coast  Irma ran roughshod in regions across the Caribbean to Florida  Both storms are considered the deadliest in a decade  No sooner than the country had experienced a breather with Hurricane Jose not turning as destructive as expected than another hurricane Maria happened to hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 
A catastrophe loss materially reduces profitability  thereby affecting the companies  finances  Being a property and casualty insurer  The Navigators Group will not escape the disaster caused by such catastrophe events  Irrespective of the techniques deployed by the company to ease catastrophes  exposure to weather related calamities makes its earnings volatile 
Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates  W R  Berkley Corporation   NYSE WRB   has recently projected a catastrophe loss of about  110 million  which translates to a  72 million after tax  Assurant Inc    NYSE AIZ   has estimated between  134 million and  140 million pre tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of  125 million pre tax  The Travelers Companies  Inc    NYSE TRV   estimates pre tax catastrophe loss from Harvey between  375 million and  750 million or  245 million and  490 million after tax

Nonetheless  the insurer has a track of delivering positive surprise in the last five quarter 
Being a property and casualty insurer the company has been prone to suffering losses owing to catastrophe events  Catastrophe pre tax losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums for the second quarter 2017 was  92 1 million compared with  240 1 million in the prior year quarter  The company s underwriting profit for the first half 2017 was  338 6 million which grew 22 1  year over year 
The P C insurer will not be able to evade the aftermath of such catastrophe events  which in turn poses a serious threat to weigh on the company s underwriting profitability in the soon to be reported quarter  While hurricanes Harvey  Irma and Maria each contributed to the company s loss estimates by 25   40  and 25   respectively  10  of such estimates is attributable to Mexican earthquakes and Typhoon Hato  The loss will however be borne equally by Insurance and Reinsurance segments 
Challenged by these natural calamities  the company continues to have significant catastrophe reinsurance protections for 2017 and 2018  including catastrophe bond protections  some of which will extend through 2019 
A catastrophe loss materially reduces profitability  thereby affecting the companies  finances  Being a property and casualty insurer  XL Group will not escape the disaster caused by such catastrophe events  However  banking on its strong capital position and  expert team the company remains well positioned in addressing the challenges or risks faced by its clients and brokers

sectors   will witness soft results in the third quarter  A soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector s third quarter results  Per our report  earnings of the Finance sector will decline 2 9  though revenues will increase 1 1  The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes  which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers  Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results  we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent We do not expect insurance pricings to be strong in the third quarter However  net investment income  an important component of an insurer s top line  is likely to

The company expects reinsurance recoveries to reduce the number by  23 million  About 55  of the catastrophe losses were related to auto coverage  Allstate added that about  53 million estimated losses and expenses from commercial insurance  auto protection contracts and loss adjusting expenses were not covered by reinsurance 
Allstate is yet to estimate catastrophe loss from Hurricane Irma that hit regions spanning Caribbean to Florida in September  
In July 2017  Allstate had estimated to have incurred pretax catastrophe losses of  181 million or  118 million after tax attributable to 13 catastrophic events that took place in June  Taking that into account  the company s total estimates are  774 million pretax and  503 million after tax for the last two months

Being a property and casualty insurer  Allstate is exposed to catastrophic events  These have weighed on the company s claims and benefits  expenses  and cash flow  draining its underwriting profitability  However  the company is making efforts to lower losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs  It is also limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets by raising premiums  This may lead to a decline in the number of policies in force

Furthermore  the company s 2017 capital investment plan is a positive  This plan complements its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  Due to these tailwinds we expect the stock to perform well in the second quarter  Detailed results should be out on Jul 25  Estimates have moved up 3 2  to  0 97 per share over the last month  The company s high debt levels  however  raise concerns

However  the Zacks analyst thinks increased investments in the business  increasing competition across geographies  discounts offered by larger chain hotels and lack of ADR growth in emerging markets can make margin expansion difficult  Detailed results are expected on Jul 27   Estimates have increased by 0 7  to  4 18 per share over the last 60 days

12388,233903,AIZ,Assurant s  AIZ  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Improve Y Y ,opinion,Assurant  Inc  s   NYSE AIZ   first quarter 2017 net operating income of  1 87 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23 8   Also  the bottom line improved 23  from  1 52 per share earned in the year ago quarter  One time client recoverables and improved extended service contract profitability in Global Lifestyle resulted in the improvement  However  ongoing declines in lender placed insurance in Global Housing partially offset the upside  The quarter also benefitted from lower reportable catastrophes  including favorable prior period reserve development Total revenue plunged 20 8  year over year to  1 51 billion due to lower premiums earned as well as a decline in fees and other income  and net investment income  Moreover  the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 62 billion by 6 9  Net investment income declined 11 1  year over year to  120 6 million Total benefits  losses and expenses decreased 26 2  to  1 3 billion  mainly due to a significant decline in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses and interest expenses Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model that supported its multi year transformation  As of fourth quarter 2016  Assurant reported through four segments   Global Housing  formerly known as the Assurant Specialty   Global Lifestyle  formerly included in the Assurant Solutions   Global Preneed  formerly included in the Assurant Solutions  and Corporate   Other Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing fell 7 9  year over year to  531 7 million  primarily due to anticipated lower placements and reduced premium rates in lender placed insurance  However  growth in multi family housing and new client revenues in lender placed insurance partially offset the downside Net operating income decreased about 19  year over year to  61 9 million  Ongoing lender placed insurance normalization and weaker performance in the mortgage solutions business led to the downside Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle declined 13 8  year over year to  804 9 million  The deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in Connected Living implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 Net operating income of  52 4 million jumped 26 6  year over year  The upside was driven by  7 5 million of one time client recoverables from Connected Living as well as credit insurance from actions taken to improve profitability in select international markets Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed grew 3 5  year over year to  44 2 million  primarily due to sales of policies written in prior years Net operating income soared 73 7  year over year to  9 9 million Net operating loss at Corporate   Other was  10 1 million  narrower than the year ago quarter net operating loss of  13 9 million  Lower employee related costs and higher investment income from increased assets at the holding company drove the improvement Financial PositionAssurant s financial position remains strong with around  605 million in corporate capital as of Mar 31  2017  Total assets dipped 0 5  to  29 6 billion as of Mar 31  2017  from  29 7 billion at year end 2016 Share Repurchase and Dividends UpdateThe company s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to  135 million in the first quarter  While share buyback totaled  105 million  dividend payout totaled  30 million The company spent about  38 million to repurchase an additional 0 4 million shares from Apr 1  through Apr 28  2017  It now has  540 million remaining in the current repurchase authorization 2017 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe losses  to remain flat with the 2016 level  This is primarily due to the anticipated profitable growth in fee based  capital light offerings  comprising Connected Living  multi family housing and mortgage solutions  and vehicle protection  However  declines in lender placed insurance and other legacy businesses are likely to limit the upside  Expense savings from enterprise transformation projects are expected to be reinvested in the business Assurant projects operating earnings per diluted share  excluding catastrophe losses  to grow in double digits from 2016 owing to share buyback activity The company expects Global Housing to witness a year over year decline in its net earned premiums and net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe losses  The ongoing lender placed insurance normalization is anticipated to result in the decrease in the above mentioned metric  However  expense savings and profitable growth in fee based  capital light business is likely to partially offset the downside Global Lifestyle s net operating income is likely to increase due to improved performance in Connected Living  fueled by mobile as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies  The decline in credit insurance and legacy North American retail clients is likely to continue  The company anticipates revenues to fall  primarily owing to a change in program structure for a large service contract client  In addition  the company estimates net earned premiums to decrease by about  500 million from 2016 due to reduction in expenses  This apart  the company might witness a rise in net earned premiums and fee income owing to growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection globally  However  results are likely to be impacted by foreign exchange Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in fee income and earnings  mainly due to sales growth across North America due to the company s alignment with market leaders and operational efficiencies Full year net operating loss of about  70 million at Corporate   Other is projected to remain flat with the 2016 level  This is because the company s continued expense reduction initiatives are likely to be offset by investments to

Operating expenses increased 10  year over year to  2 billion in the first quarter  primarily due to higher restructuring costs  operating expenses related to acquisitions and increased expenses to support organic revenue growth  However  this was partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translations  reduction in expenses related to certain hedging programs  and savings from restructuring activities and operational initiatives 
Organic Revenue DriversCommercial Risk Solutions organic revenues increased 2  over the prior year period on solid growth across the U S   EMEA  Asia  and Pacific regions  partially offset by a decline in Latin America

12393,233908,AIZ,AIG Prices Sale Of 6 4 M Arch Capital Shares Through IPO,opinion,"American International Group  Inc    NYSE AIG   recently priced the sale of 6 4 million common shares of Arch Capital Group Ltd   NYSE L    AIG will get approximately  590 million of gross proceeds with this offering  The shares were issued following AIG s sale of its mortgage business unit  United Guaranty Corp   to Arch in 2016  which involved the conversion of 0 64 million Convertible Preferred Shares of Arch received by AIG   The transaction  currently subject to customary closing conditions  is expected to close by Jun 14  2017 
AIG sold off United Guaranty to Arch Capital Group in order to shed its non core businesses  This step was taken to make its business leaner and focus more on the ones generating higher returns  The mammoth underperforming insurer has been aggressively recalibrating its business after investor Carl Icahn called for its speedy turnaround 
The extreme diversification in the company s business has posed a hindrance due to lack of synergy and dampened shareholders  confidence in the stock  Shares of AIG have lost 1 75  year to date compared with the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 4 4  

Coming back to the present deal  AIG has granted the underwriters a 30 day option to purchase an additional 957 210 common shares of Arch issuable upon conversion of 95 721 additional Convertible Preferred Shares held by it  The company is expected to receive additional proceeds of approximately  89 million if the underwriters exercise their option in full  AIG would also continue to own 542 420 Convertible Preferred Shares following the transaction 
Divesture has been a major strategy of the company to focus on its core operations  In 2016  AIG completed the sale of its Taiwan unit  It also sold Advisor Group to investment funds affiliated with Lightyear Capital LLC 
Moreover  the company also sold  sell its Japan life insurance business   AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company  Ltd   AFLI    to FWD Group  the insurance arm of Pacific Century Group  Furthermore  AIG has entered into strategic agreements with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited to offload its commercial and consumer insurance operations in Argentina  Chile  Colombia  Uruguay  Venezuela and Turkey 
We expect the company s divestments to bear fruit soon and put it back on the growth trajectory once again

ExxonMobil s shares have underperformed the Zacks Oil International Integrated industry   9 4  vs   0 8   as well as peer Chevron  NYSE CVX was down  0 1    Tensions between the U S  and Russia could mar the integrated major s prospects for exploiting huge Russian oil and gas reserves  Moreover  dependence on costly offshore drilling might dent ExxonMobil s cashflow 
However  ExxonMobil has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base  both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint  With a stable cash position  the company s balance sheet is one of the best in the industry  The company has been investing heavily in its extensive refining businesses  which will likely help it counter downturns in upstream businesses owing to volatile commodity prices  Also  ExxonMobil s earnings surprise history is pretty attractive 
 You can   
Starbucks  shares are down  2 9  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Food   Restaurants industry  which is up  6 5  over the same period  The consequential increment in spending is likely to create pressure on its bottom line in the near term  Also  economic  geopolitical and consumer headwinds continue to impact Starbucks  results 
However  the company s operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint  successful innovations  best in class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong  Again  digital initiatives like mobile order pay  delivery services and third party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas  CPG growth across the world as well as China Asia expansion will also lead to value creation  These initiatives might benefit the company in the long run 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Marsh   McLennan have outperformed the Zacks Insurance Broker industry  year to date  gaining   23 2  vs   21 8    The company is well poised for growth on the back of significant investments and acquisitions made within its different operating units 
These deals have enabled the company to enter new geographies  expand within the existing ones  foray into new businesses  develop new segments and specialize within existing businesses  Its effective capital management via share buyback and dividend payment is impressive However  exposure to currency volatility due to high international presence and integration risks from acquisitions raises concerns  Also  low interest rates have suppressed investment income

12407,233922,AIZ,Week In Review  Is The Trump Trade Back  Equities Think So,opinion,"by Eli Wright
After spending much of last week in narrow  choppy trading the US dollar as well as US equities  were boosted on Thursday by President Trump s statement in a meeting with airline executives that his goal of  lowering the overall tax burden on American business    is  way ahead of schedule   The President  that within the next few weeks the specifics of his tax overhaul would be announced 
Markets also appeared to approve of Trump s Thursday evening phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping  during which Mr  Trump agreed to uphold the US s  One China  policy  a clear reversal on threats the then President elect made in December to recognize Taiwan diplomatically 
The US Dollar Index rose one percent to close the week above the 100 benchmark  at 100 71  The greenback may have already bottomed  and could resume its uptrend this coming week  especially if this coming week s economic releases including CPI  Retail Sales and Industrial Production come in stronger than expected 
On Friday all three major Wall Street indices pushed further into record high territory  albeit on lighter than normal volumes  On the week  the Dow gained one percent  to 20 269 37  the S P 500 rose 0 8   to 2 316 10  and the NASDAQ closed 1 2  higher  at 5 734 13  The Russell 2000 had a good finish as well  breaking out from the sideways range its been trading in since early December  Heavier volume in the coming week could signal profit taking before low volume buying resumes on dips 
Oil rises on OPEC cuts
Despite US weekly crude inventories rising by a surprising 13 83M  significantly more than the 2 53M expected  crude oil prices rose 1 2  at the end of the week to  53 87  The strong finish was due  in part  to a  by the International Energy Agency  IEA  indicating that during January there has been 90  compliance among OPEC members to the production cuts that were promised at the end of November  Though not all members were complaint  Saudi Arabia  Qatar and Angola each cut more than promised 
Prices will continue to fluctuate based on falling OPEC and rising US production  though some analysts believe technicals are signaling that the longer term trend is down  In the shorter term  prices could rise to  55 25  To the downside  we could see  52 challenged 

Gold bounces higher
Gold prices rose 1 1  on the week  to  1 235 and there s still room for the yellow metal to run to  1 270 and beyond 
That said  it must be noted that gold saw most of its weekly gains during the first three days of the past week  when markets were still nervously watching politics  If the dollar continues its upward trend and risk on sentiment returns as US equities break new record highs  gold could correct to  1 215 

Copper price boosted on China growth  strike
Copper prices continued moving higher as the week ended  boosted by strong trade figures out of China showing that both imports and exports increased YoY  Earlier in the week  the red metal moved higher on news that workers at BHP Billiton s  NYSE BHP  Chilean Escondida mine were on strike  Escondida is the world s largest copper mine  responsible for five percent of global copper output  While there is always the chance that support could get tested at  2 053  the red metal could rise to  3 40

Consensus Estimate by 12 3   Moreover  the bottom line plunged 34 6  from  1 53 per share earned in the year ago quarter  Higher reportable catastrophe losses  ongoing normalization of lender placed insurance business  and declines in mobile and legacy extended service contracts and credit insurance led to the year over year deterioration  However  lower Corporate net operating loss partially offset the downside Total revenue plunged 33 2  year over year to  1 68 billion due to lower premiums earned and a decline in net investment income  However  it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 64 billion by 2 7  Net investment income  excluding Assurant Health runoff operations  declined 16 1  year over year to  124 8 million Total benefits  losses and expenses decreased 37 1  to  1 6

Assurant Solutions inched up 3 3  year over year to  971 million on increase in mobile subscribers as well as vehicle protection contracts  However  the effect of foreign exchange volatility as well as decline in legacy retail clients and credit insurance partially offset the improvement Net operating income declined 18 5  year over year to  42 7 million  Lower contributions from mobile  legacy extended service contracts and credit insurance led to the downside Net earned premiums  fees and others at Assurant Specialty Property declined 3 1  year over year to  579 1 million  The deterioration was primarily attributable to the ongoing normalization of lender placed insurance business  Growth in mortgage solutions  which includes fee income from the recently acquired title and valuation business  and multi family housing businesses partially offset the downside Net operating income of  44 6 million plunged 48 9  year over year  The downside was attributable to higher

registered from new and existing mobile programs in 2016 is not anticipated to offset the declines in legacy extended service contract  credit insurance and the loss of the tablet program  Nonetheless  the company expects net earned premiums  and fees to increase owing to growth in mobile subscribers and vehicle service contracts  However  lower service contract revenues from legacy North American retail clients as well as continued declines in credit insurance are likely to adversely impact results Assurant Specialty Property s net earned premiums and net operating income are likely to decline due to the ongoing normalization of lender placed insurance business  However  increased efficiencies and expense saving initiatives will somewhat mitigate the deterioration  The company envisions expansion in multi family housing and mortgage solutions businesses through gain in market shares  However  overall results are likely to be affected by catastrophe losses  including claims from

You can see 
JPMorgan s shares have outperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry over the past six months  up  15 3  vs   10 8    This price performance is backed by impressive earnings surprise history  with the company having surpassed expectations in all the trailing four quarters  The Zacks analyst likes the bank s efforts to control expenses  Combined with the improved rate scenario and rising loan demand  these initiatives should continue to benefit JPMorgan s financials  Given its solid liquidity position  the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities  However  the company faces persistent fee income growth challenges  mainly due to slowdown in trading activities and dismal capital markets performance  Also  legal expenses are expected to continue lingering in the near term

Shares of Buy rated Texas Instruments have gained  41 9  over the last 12 months  underperforming the Zacks General Semiconductor industry which has gained  46 3  over the same period  However  the Zacks analyst likes Texas Instruments  prudent R D investments in several high margin  high growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets  This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and dollar content at customers  while reducing exposure to volatile consumer computing markets  Margins continue to expand on secular strength in the auto and industrial markets  a stronger mix of analog and embedded processing products and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300 millimeter Analog output  Estimates have been going up ahead of the company s Q4 earnings release  The company has positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  However  increasing competition  unfavorable currency effect and a high debt load remain concerns

Buy rated McDonald s shares have gained  12 8  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry which has gained  3 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes the fact that growing guest count remains McDonald s top priority and that it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end  Increased focus on delivery  enhancement of digital capabilities  and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should drive growth too  Efforts to attract customers in International Lead   High Growth Markets also bode well  In fact  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the past eight quarters  Meanwhile  augmented focus on refranchising will cut the company s capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth and ROE expansion in the long run  Yet  high labor costs and currency headwinds might keep profits under pressure  Also  political and economic unrest in some parts of the world and a not so enticing U S  restaurant space might restrict sales growth

12437,233952,AIZ,Assurant  AIZ  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,Assurant  Inc    NYSE AIZ   reported fourth quarter 2017 net operating income of  1 84 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 5   Also  the figure skyrocketed 300  from the year ago period  Lower reportable catastrophe loss and the absence of lender placed regulatory expenses in Global Housing  drove this improvement Assurant  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     The company remains optimistic on building a strong foundation in 2018 with the closing of its buyout of The Warranty Group and leveraging the company s expanded scale and experience in key Housing and Lifestyle markets in order to achieve sustainable long term  profitable growth Total revenues declined 2 8  year over year to  1 7 billion  mainly due to lower premiums earned  fees and other income plus net investment income  However  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 9  Net investment income deteriorated 12 2  year over year to  118 6 million Total benefits  losses and expenses decreased 10 6  to  1 5 billion  mainly owing to a substantial decline in policyholder benefits as well as selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses Full Year HighlightsFor 2017  Assurant reported net operating income per share of  3 98  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 6  but deteriorating 10 9  year over year Total revenues of  6 3 billion fell 9 6  year over year Segmental PerformanceAssurant has revised its reportable segments in keeping with its evolved global operating model  which supported its multi year transformation  As of fourth quarter 2016  Assurant reported through four segments   Global Housing  formerly known as the Assurant Specialty   Global Lifestyle  formerly included in the Assurant Solutions   Global Preneed  formerly included in the Assurant Solutions  and Corporate   Other Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing fell about 1 5  year over year to  562 8 million  primarily due to anticipated lower lender placed insurance revenue  net of reduced catastrophe premiums  Also  reduced demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions led to this downside  However  growth in multi family housing and revenues from new lender placed loans onboarded in 2017  partially offset this downside The company reported net operating income of  89 6 million  which skyrocketed 729 6  from the year ago quarter  This stellar performance was mainly attributable to lower reportable catastrophes and the absence of lender placed regulatory expenses compared with the prior year quarter Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle slipped 1 7  year over year to  913 6 million  This deterioration was primarily attributable to a change in program structure for a large service contract client in this particular segment Net operating income of  42 8 million increased 23 7  year over year  The upside was driven by higher contributions from Connected Living  fueled by global mobile programs including a  5 million client recoverable and growth from vehicle protection  However  results were partially offset by declines in credit insurance Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed grew 9  year over year to  45 9 million  primarily owing to growth in Canada along with realization of revenues from prior period sales of the Final Need product in the United States Net operating income plunged 57 8  year over year to  4 6 million  mainly due to a software impairment worth  5 million Net operating loss at Corporate   Other was  29 1 million  substantially wider than the year ago quarter s net operating loss of  20 3 million  Lower net investment income and a charge related to workforce reductions  worth  4 6 million  were responsible for the deterioration Financial PositionAssurant s financial position remains strong with around  540 million in corporate capital as of Dec 31  2017  Total assets rose 7 2  to  31 8 billion as of Dec 31  2017 from  29 7 billion at year end 2016 Share Repurchase and Dividend UpdateThe company s total share buybacks and dividends amounted to  169 million in the fourth quarter  While share buyback totaled  139 million  dividend payout totaled  30 million The company has  293 4 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization 2018 OutlookAssurant estimates net operating income  excluding reportable catastrophe loss  to grow between 10  and 14  from the reported results of  412 million in 2017  The growth in earnings is likely to reflect a lower effective tax rate and considerable rise in underlying segment earnings  while adjusting for  12 5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items   Declines in lender placed insurance and credit insurance might be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi family housing as well as vehicle protection Notably  with the sanction of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  Assurant s consolidated effective tax rate is anticipated to decrease to 22 23  from 33  with nearly one third of the savings to be reinvested to support future growth Assurant projects operating earnings per share  excluding catastrophe loss  to grow in excess of net operating income  representing the benefit of a lower consolidated effective tax rate  moderate growth in underlying earnings as well as capital management The company expects Global Housing to witness a year over year decline in its net operating income excluding reportable catastrophe loss before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform  Further  decline in the ongoing lender placed insurance normalization is anticipated as the housing market continues to improve  However  continued growth in multi family housing and better performance in mortgage solutions are likely to partially offset this downside  Additional savings from expense management efforts are to be realized toward the end of 2018 and further into 2019  Higher net operating income is expected after reflecting a lower effective tax rate of about 20   Revenues are projected to be close to 2017 levels as decrease in lender placed insurance normalization are offset by growth in multi family housing and mortgage solutions Global Lifestyle s net operating income is likely to increase before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform  Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection as well as expense efficiencies  The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside  Lower effective tax rate with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  is anticipated to boost results  Moreover  the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection  globally Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and earnings  mainly on the back of the company s alignment with market leaders before taking into consideration the recently sanctioned tax reform  Lower effective tax rate with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  is anticipated to boost results Assurant expects full year net operating loss to be close to 2017 s loss of  63 million before considering the recently sanctioned tax reform at Corporate   Other  The loss will increase after taking into account an effective tax rate of about 20  Zacks RankAssurant carries a Zacks Rank  3

NASDAQ PTI   5 Stocks in the Limelight on New Analyst CoverageNew analyst coverage unearths extensive data on stocks for investors  Analysts are privy to vital information which is crucial for investment decisions  Lack of information creates chances of misinterpretation of stocks  over or undervalued  Coverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely holds some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t like to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks Needless to say  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Impact on Stock PriceThe price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased

Consensus Estimate by 5 8   Also  the bottom line improved 6 9  from the year ago period  Lower effective tax rate owing to the tax cut and decent underlying profitable growth in key businesses like mobile business and multi family housing  drove this improvement  However  higher level of net operating loss at the Corporate segment and a substantial catastrophe loss in Global Housing  partially offset this upside Assurant  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Total revenues improved 7 2  year over year to  1 6 billion  mainly attributable to higher premiums earned  fees and other income as well as net investment income  Moreover  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 2  Net investment income improved nearly 8  year over year to  130 2 million Total benefits  loss and expenses increased 12 4  to  1 5 billion  mainly due to a substantial increase in policyholder benefits  selling  underwriting  general and administrative expenses and interest expense Segmental PerformanceNet earned premiums  fees and others at Global Housing slid about 1 6  year over year to  523 1 million  primarily due to lower placement rates as well as real estate owned volume in lender placed insurance plus reduction in client demand for originations and field services in mortgage solutions  However  sustained growth in multi family housing and higher contributions from international housing products partially offset this downside The company reported net operating income of  71 2 million  which increased 15  from the year ago quarter  This improvement was mainly attributable to the impact of the reduced effective tax rate   Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Lifestyle improved 14 1  year over year to  918 5 million  This benefit was primarily driven by growth in new and existing mobile protection programs as well as vehicle protection  However  a decline in mobile trade in volumes partially offset the upside Net operating income of  55 8 million rose 6 5  year over year  The upside was driven by the impact of the reduced effective tax rate Net earned premiums  fees and others at Global Preneed grew 4 5  year over year to  46 2 million

considerable rise in underlying segment earnings  while adjusting for  12 5 million of net benefits in 2017 disclosed items   Declines in lender placed insurance and credit insurance are likely to be offset by a profitable increase in Connected Living and multi family housing as well as vehicle protection Notably  with the sanction of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  TCJA   Assurant s consolidated

the recently sanctioned tax reform  Profitable growth is likely to be fueled by newly introduced mobile programs as well as vehicle protection expansion and expense efficiencies  The ongoing decline in credit insurance will partially offset this probable upside  Lower effective tax rate of 22 24  with a portion of the tax savings to be reinvested for future growth  is anticipated to boost results  Moreover  the company projects revenues to improve from growth in Connected Living and vehicle protection  globally Global Preneed is anticipated to experience an increase in its revenues and

12462,233977,AIZ,Cigna s Anthem Merger On Tenterhooks  Growth In The Cards,opinion,On Jul 11  we uploaded our research report on health insurer Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   which is due to be acquired by Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   by the second half of 2016  The companies claim that the combination would be a net positive to both since it will lead to increased membership  A broader member base will also lead to spread costs and expenses  thus bringing down overall cost   But the mega merger has drawn criticism from regulators  The Department of Justice is closely scrutinizing the merger and might also nix it on concerns that it could stifle competition in the industry  The merger of Anthem and Cigna would mean more power in the hands of the surviving company   Anthem  which will gain in size and scale  It is feared that the company which already has a history of rejecting claims and insufficiently addressing consumer grievances  will bother even less to service its customers  once it gains strength It is also being contemplated that the insurer will have lesser incentive to improve the quality of its products and services  since there will be very few and small players to compete with  The company may also hike premium and increase out of pocket costs  which will directly come from customers  pockets Whether or not the deal with Anthem goes through  it appears to us that Cigna is one of the few companies that is well positioned to grow over the coming years given its mix of business  The company is exposed to strong growth areas of healthcare  relatively protected from healthcare reform thanks to its international presence and enjoys diversity in products The company has lesser exposure to exchanges and has a primarily Administrative Services Only  ASO  book  We believe that ASO exposure will benefit the company in the coming years as the book increasingly takes share from risk insurance CIGNA CORP Price and Consensus   Also  the company has the largest exposure to the international market  which has been consistently growing  The international business also carries a higher margin than the commercial business When it comes to Accountable Care Organizations  ACO   Cigna has one of the most established track records among its peers  On average  these ACOs are able to hit 2  cost savings and 3  quality improvement targets within two years of their inception  The company currently has more than 134 collaborative care relationships spanning 29 states and is expected to continue with ACO growth Moreover  Cigna s CEO Dave Cordani has simplified and refocused its business lines into areas where it has a competitive advantage and has jettisoned segments that no longer fit the company s business strategy  This included the sale of the Variable Annuity Death Benefit and GMIB segments to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   This business restructuring has reduced the operational risk for the company Nevertheless  stiff competition  rising expenses  foreign exchange fluctuation and exposure to commercial mortgage loans are some of the headwinds faced by the company Cigna carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked players are  and Assurant Inc    NYSE AIZ   James River Group Holdings  Ltd    NASDAQ JRVR    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ,2016-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/cigna's-anthem-merger-on-tenterhooks,-growth-in-the-cards-200141105",200141105

12485,234000,AIZ,15 Mid Caps Offering Both Growth And Value In 2013,opinion,If you are looking for growth at a reasonable valuation  the following 15 mid cap stocks are worth keeping an eye on  All of these stocks have reasonable earnings and book multiples  and have demonstrated EPS growth that s among the highest in their industries  In addition  they are all available now at a PEG ratio under 1   As you look through this list  remember that while we often talk about growth and value as two different sides of the coin  they are not mutually exclusive  The difficulty lies in getting a good estimation of the future growth and for that reason the PEG ratio is one of the least useful indicators for investing  More often than not  a low PEG just indicates that analysts might have an inflated expectation of future growth  which is not shared by investors  For this reason  I prefer to look at the EPS growth in the past 5 years to see how the company has performed in the recent past  While still not a guarantee  the recent historical performance can be a better indicator of whether the company has a good sustainable growth strategy  Of course  everything else needs to be checked out as well and to cut risk even further  you should convince yourself that the value does exist  1  Synnex Corporation  SNX  SYNNEX is an IT distributor and BPO service provider in business since 1980  Both revenues and earnings have seen steady growth in the past and the company seems to be selling at a great earnings multiple discount to its peers  The stock could deliver a solid  even if not spectacular  returns this year 2  EZCORP Inc  EZPW EZCORP runs a network of over 1200 pawn shops and cash advance centers in US  Canada and Mexico  Business has been brisk as the EPS growth shows although a recovering economy may cause a decline in demand for its services  The stock is certainly cheap and at this level the downside should be very little  Longer term investors should find this a good time to buy although the wait to profit may be a little uncertain 3  Kullick and Soffa  KLIC Kulicke and Soffa Industries  Inc  designs  manufactures  and sells capital equipment and expendable tools to assemble semiconductor devices  including integrated circuits  discrete devices  light emitting diodes  and power modules  As with most semiconductor stocks  KLIC is at depressed levels now  The P E ratio of 5 84 becomes even more ridiculous considering close to half of the  930 million market value of the company is made up by cold tangible cash with zero debt to worry about  Semiconductor cycle remains a question mark  The financial strength of the company is not in question and neither is its undervaluation  The only question is if you are willing to wait for a couple of years to see meaningful appreciation in the stock as the semiconductor cycle plays out 4  Helen of Troy Limited  HELE While  343 m in debt might be of concern  the company has sufficient cash flow to manage it  This consumer products company has grown revenues and earnings at an impressive clip  It also sells for half the industry price to earnings multiple  Its brand name toiletries and other mundane home products are less likely to be impacted by inflation  Watch out for the excessive CEO pay and recent history or insider sales 5  Protective Life  PL Alabama based life insurance company has  3 46 B cash on the books with  2 39 B in market value  It also pays a 2 4  dividend yield  There is also  2 53 B in debt on the books  Valuing an insurance company is a different animal and we have had some spectacular successes in the past in our portfolio so while the rewards can be there  make sure you understand the key balance sheet line items before you decide to invest 6  Acco Brands  ACCO ACCO Brands Corporation engages in the design  manufacture  marketing  and distribution of office products primarily in the United States  Australia  the United Kingdom  and Canada  We are all familiar with company s various brands such as Quartet  Rexel  Swingline  Wilson Jones  Marbig  NOBO  ACCO  Derwent  Eastlight  Mead  Five Star  Trapper Keeper  AT A GLANCE  Cambridge  Day Runner  Hilroy  Tilibra  and Grafon s  The company does have significant debt which is weighing on the stock  The company has grown its Q3 earnings five fold recently after it acquired MeadWestvaco s consumer and office products business  gaining products like Mead  Five Star  and Trapper Keeper so it is quite possible that debt can be swiftly handled  in which case the stock valuation today might be very attractive 7  CACI International  CACI CACI International provides IT services to Federal government and commercial markets  Its services include intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance solutions  command and control solutions to support military  homeland security  law enforcement  border security  emergency response  and disaster relief missions  For a service company a P B ratio of 1 18 is attractive  While the recent fiscal cliff deal avoided cutting defense spending  there is a good possibility that it will be back on the table in the near future and this presents a definite risk for the stock and quite possibly the valuation might get more attractive in the next few months 8  AGCO Corporation  AGCO I have been quite bullish on the agricultural stocks and have looked deep and hard at AGCO in the past  Valuations remain attractive for this agriculture equipment company even after 30  return since May 2012  The agriculture case is mostly macro economic as I remarked in my earlier post on this sector  coincidently  or not  posted in May 2012  this list has other stocks you may want to consider as well 9  MetroPCS Communication  PCS Bruce Kovner and John Paulson like this wireless company  The company has reported nice earnings growth and it is on track to merge with T Mobile  DTE DE   However there is a potential for a bidding war and Sprint  S  has reportedly expressed interest at  13 39 share  PCS shares currently trade at  9 73 10  Celestica Inc  CLS Celestica Inc  provides electronics manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers and service providers in the communications  consumer  computing  and industrial  aerospace and defense  healthcare  green technology  and semiconductor capital equipment end markets in the Americas  Asia  and Europe  This Canadian company also holds more than a third of its market value in cash  Earnings and revenues have been under pressure along with the rest of the industry and the case for this stock is similar to that of KLIC above 11  Cash America International  CSH CSH is another pawn shop payday advance lender that has seen great last few years  While the macro case remains the same as EZPW  the valuations are perhaps a little richer  I would avoid this stock despite what the PEG ratio says12  The Andersons  Inc  ANDE If you are looking for more Ag stocks  you may want to consider The Andersons  In addition to its Grain  Ethanol  Rail  Plant Nutrient  Turf   Specialty segments  it operates The Andersons retail stores  The Andersons Market  a specialty food market  a distribution center  and a lawn and garden equipment sales and service shop  The company has growing revenues  earnings and a growing dividend that currently yields 1 5  13  Assurant Inc  AIZ An incredibly cheap insurer  Assurant operates in four segments  Assurant Solutions  Assurant Specialty Property  Assurant Health  and Assurant Employee Benefits  In addition to the attractive valuations  the stock pays a 2 3  dividend  The company was significantly affected by superstorm Sandy and its rates are getting scrutinized by state regulators  However  the improving housing market will help Assurant s business and this may be an attractive time to pick this stock up 14  Select Medical Holdings  SEM Select Medical Holdings Corporation  through its subsidiary  Select Medical Corporation  operates specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the United States  Revenues and specifically earnings have been growing at a rapid clip but the debt is high  The stock is being snapped up by institutions  At some point  the baby boomer demography will become a major force in changing the economic climate of the country and the stock should benefit  However the high debt levels give me pause as to how the growth can be funded 15  Whiting Petroleum  WLL  Not very cheap  nevertheless a good stock to consider given the oil gas drilling expansion currently occurring in the United States  The company engages in the acquisition  development  exploitation  exploration  and production of oil and gas primarily in the Permian Basin  Rocky Mountains  Mid Continent  Gulf Coast  and Michigan  Estimated reserves are 345 2 million barrels equivalent of oil and the current market value is  5 44 B with about 20  profit margin  Raw numbers say the stock is a little

12486,234001,AIZ,Thoughts On The Facebook Offering And Investing In IPOs,opinion,If you are a manager of corporate bonds  you get to learn the speculation cycle  New IPOs may close in weeks if things are cold  and close in minutes if things are hot When things are hot in bonds  eventually the syndicate   Wall Street   decides that it is time to test the bullishness of buyers  At such a time  they extend the time of the offering  and either lower the yield spread  raise the price   or increase the size of the deal When I was a corporate bond manager  if a deal was upsized by a large amount during a period while the market was hot  I would not buy  Tough decision  but cutting against the grain is usually a good thing  My brokers marveled that I was not participating in these large  benchmark  deals  More often then not  they failed  and I smiled on the sidelines  The brokers  stuffed  the ignorant buy side that was all too willing to take risk  Typically after that  corporate investors were more careful I don t know the right value for Facebook  FB   and I don t think anyone does  Too much of the value depends on future decisions  competitor actions  and economic conditions  Valuing stocks where the positive cash flows are far out into the future is tough  should the cash flows materialize The last IPO I bought was Assurant   AIZ  where I was buying the company for  90  of book value   and 9x earnings  I m a value buyer  so I buy companies where prospects are not fairly calculated by the market  but I avoid new issues where the price is outlandish Look  Wall Street works on two levels  distribute paper at a slight discount price  until buyers take it for granted and bid aggressively  leading to a mini crisis  like it is for Facebook now Did Wall Street get the best price for Facebook s current shareholders at the IPO  Probably yes Was that the right price  For recent investors  the answer is no  But in any IPO process there were a wide number of ways to protect themselves 1  Don t participate in IPOs  When general valuations in the market  are high  IPO valuations are higher 2  Avoid buying IPOs in hot sectors  they are often overvalued  Only go for IPOs in sectors no one cares about  like insurance  where I offer you Assurant  AIZ  and Safety Insurance  SAFT   among others   I don t suppose it helps you to learn that insurers return better than almost any other industry   Didn t think so  because it is a boring yet complicated business  Even Buffett said about Assurant    too complicated   and he is one of the greatest insurance executives of all time  3  Avoid IPOs where the deal size is upsized  When a deal is upsized that often means the underwriters are taking advantage of demand  which diminishes the likelihood of any short term outperformance  For this point  in the bond market  I would cut my bid  unless I really liked the credit  together with my analyst 4  Avoid IPOs where the price talk is raised  which also limits the likelihood of any short term outperformance  Same thing as a bond manager  I would drop out out if the new yield did not meet my yield needs 5  Buy IPOs when they are forced to occur and are hated    and most mutual insurer conversions   IPOs are like the market on steroids  you want to avoid them when things a hot  but they are interesting when things are cold   After all  who wants to IPO when things are cold   There are occasional situations where legal matters force a company to go public  and that can be an interesting time to be an opportunistic buyer 6  Avid IPOs where the valuation is stretched  It may be a great business concept  but can it grow into that fancy valuation   Unlike Dr  Damodaran  I don t go in for fancy reasoning that justifies high valuations  Most investors are better off avoiding high valuation situations  and focus on more down to earth types of businesses   My recent purchases include  Crude Oil Refining   Transport  Integrated Oil Major  two basic technology companies with forward P Es under 10  a specialty retailer that is the strongest in its category  and two insurers  one that is a holding company  and one that is a hedge fund  7  Finally  avoid IPOs where those that know nothing about investing are interested  Facebook is a perfect example here  with a large number of users who love the company  but have little idea of how profits are made  or how they will grow IPOs are tough  I think tougher than ordinary investing  so  avoid them unless you have an edge that justifies participation  Be tough on yourself here   what is your edge   Share it with a friend who has expertise  and see if he agrees with you  This is not easy stuff  it only seems easy when the market is running hot  and that is a bad place to be when it goes cold Full disclosure  long AIZ  for me and clients,2012-06-07,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-on-the-facebook-offering-and-investing-in-ipos-125771,125771
12487,234002,AIZ,The Product That Never Saw The Light Of Day,opinion,I have never particularly liked individual variable life and annuity products  But one day  I came up with an individual variable annuity product idea  I don t think it has ever been done  If it has been done  please note it in the comments below Most individual variable annuity products offer some hard to price guarantee Guaranteed Minimum Death BenefitGuaranteed Minimum Accumulation BenefitGuaranteed Minimum Income BenefitGuaranteed Minimum Withdrawal BenefitThis product would have no such guarantees  It would also be sold by agents inside the mutual fund companies  and carry no commission  I call it T shares  for deferred TAX shares  The insurance company offering this would go to mutual fund companies  and offer to train mutual fund company representatives to be insurance agents  The T shares would have the same annual fee as the  no load  C shares  plus 0 2  year for the insurance company  The T share buyer gets the option of having a tax deferred mutual fund for the price of 0 2  extra per year Considering the ease of not having to track your cost basis on a mutual fund  and the additional growth from compounding what is not taxed  this could be a very attractive proposition  It would be interesting to have contractual provisions that allow the annuitant to be changed during the deferral period  even after death  so that the tax savings could continue There has to be a loser here  but who The obvious one is the taxman  Much of the mutual fund industry could end up issuing T shares  instead of C shares But the other one is not so obvious  I pitched this idea to a number of insurers  One said   Great idea  but why should we cannibalize our existing block of variable annuity policies to make less   That told me I needed to approach large life companies that had no variable products  So I spoke to one of the few that was like that  and the CEO was interested  but nothing came of it  because he left soon afterward As a buy side analyst of insurers  I tossed the idea out to most of the life insurance CEOs I met that I knew had no individual variable annuity block of policies  No one bit  Maybe it would be the complexity of making the policy work across a large number of mutual fund companies  The IT expertise needed would be considerable  So would the legal documents But no one grabbed the idea and ran with it  Personally  I think a lot of people would like this product  but it never saw the light of day  Mmmm  I never talked to Assurant about this one  On the other hand  maybe the place to start is with the mutual fund companies  they might have the greater interest PS   to those who are receiving buyout offers some life insurers on variable annuities with guarantees  turn them down  They are not offering you what the guarantees are truly worth  Unless you know something critical that they don t  don t take the buyout offer Full Disclosure  long AIZ  and many other insurers,2013-01-31,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-product-that-never-saw-the-light-of-day-153225,153225
12488,234003,AIZ,15 Cheapest Stocks With Share Buyback Potential,opinion,As you may know  I love growing dividends but my dividend approach has a great fault  It doesn t take great cash cow stocks with no dividend payments into account   Dividend payments are only one way to distribute money back to shareholders  Another way is when companies buy their own shares back  Some companies repurchase their shares instead of a dividend payment and they try to boost earnings per share growth with this model  It s a very tax optimized method  especially if you use debt for this process as happened with Apple  AAPL    I also look at the number of shares repurchased when I consider buying a stock  The total amount of cash distribution is critical in these cases and not the amount of dividend payments in the past  Some companies gave back money in the amount of their whole company over the recent five years and they try to follow this approach for the future  That s what I really like   So today I m screening the Share Buyback Achievers Index in search of  the cheapest dividend stocks with additional growth potential  I selected stocks with a low forward P E  under 15  as well as a P B and P S ratio of less than one  In addition  the five year earnings per share should grow at least with five percent or more   Fifteen stocks fulfilled the above mentioned criteria  Half of the results pay a dividend between 1 percent and 2 5 percent  The rest are only focused on share buybacks  The good thing is that nine companies have a current buy or better rating Xerox Corporation  XRX

12497,234012,AIZ,Stocks    Wall Street Roars Back from Big Early Losses,news,"Investing com   Stocks found a footing after plunging right after Wednesday s open  finishing the day mostly ahead 
The Dow Jones industrials were off nearly 600 points by 9 45 AM ET  13 45 GMT  but recovered to finish down just 0 1  or 22 points  The S P 500 was down as much as 0 2   or 56 points  but came back to finish with a gain of 0 1   The Nasdaq Composite ended up 0 4  after falling as much as 1 3  
Markets around the world were punched about by a surprising earnings disappointment from Walt   Disney    NYSE DIS  and unexpected interest rate cuts in India  New Zealand and Thailand  The rate cuts were due in part to slowing growth in all three countries and continued worries about the effects of the United States China trade fight 
The uncertainty created by the rate cuts helped gold futures jump to a six year high of  1519 60 an ounce  up  35 40 or 2 4   Gold is up 4 3  this week and 5 7  so far in August  Its 18 6  gain for the year is better than the year to date gains for the Dow  S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite  
Gold mining stocks were higher  and the SPDR  Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  exchange traded fund added 1 5   It s up 16 3  for the year  thanks to a 9 2  gain in the second quarter and a 5 9  gain so far in the third quarter  The gold shares ETF invests directly in gold 
 
Disney missed earnings estimates and disclosed it was taking an earnings impairment from the box office failure of  Dark Phoenix   a film inherited from its  71 billion merger with the Fox studio business 
The shares were off 4 9  and subtracted about 47 points by themselves  Still  the shares are up 23  on the year 
The market s gyrations came as bond yields tumbled  The 10 Year Treasury Yield fell to 1 709  from Tuesday s 1 739  after falling to a 52 week low of 1 595  
The rate drop helped the iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NASDAQ TLT  exchange traded fund hit a 52 week high of  143 06  The ETF ended at  140 03  up slightly on the day  The ETF  however  is up 15 2  this year as rates have come down  
The rate declines hurt financial stocks 
JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   down 2 2   was the Dow s biggest loser after  Disney   SVB Financial Group  NASDAQ SIVB   parent of Silicon Valley Bank  fell 4 7     Charles Schwab    NYSE SCHW  dropped 4 6  
Oil prices fell nearly 5  and are now off more than 20  since peaking in April  West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell nearly 5  to  50 96 a barrel  Brent crude slumped 4 6  to  56 22 
The oil price decline hit energy stocks  especially oil services stocks like Schlumberger  NYSE SLB  and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  and oil and exploration stocks like Apache   NYSE APA

12505,234020,AIZ,Notes on the 2011 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report  Part 4  10K Issues ,opinion,BHRG periodically assumes risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts  Retroactive reinsurance contracts afford protection to ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising under policies issued in prior years  Coverage under such contracts is provided on an excess basis or immediately with respect to losses payable after the inception of the contract  Coverage provided is normally subject to a large aggregate limit of indemnification  Significant amounts of environmental and latent injury claims may arise under the contracts  Under certain contracts written over the last five years  the limits of indemnification provided are exceptionally large  In March 2007  an agreement became effective between NICO and Equitas  a London based entity established to reinsure and manage the 1992 and prior years  non life liabilities of the Names or Underwriters at Lloyd s of London  Under the agreement NICO is providing up to  7 billion of new reinsurance to Equitas  In 2009  NICO agreed to provide up to 5 billion Swiss Francs  approximately  5 3 billion as of December 31  2011  of aggregate excess retroactive protection to Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd  and its affiliates   Swiss Re    In 2010  BHRG entered into a reinsurance agreement with Continental Casualty Company  a subsidiary of CNA Financial Corporation   CNA    and several of CNA s other insurance subsidiaries  collectively the  CNA Companies   under which BHRG assumed the asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities of the CNA Companies subject to a maximum limit of indemnification of  4 billion  In 2011  BHRG entered into a contract with Eaglestone Reinsurance Company  a subsidiary of American International Group  Inc    AIG    Under the contract  BHRG agreed to reinsure the bulk of AIG s U S  asbestos liabilities up to a maximum limit of indemnification of  3 5 billion Retroactive insurance is an interesting business  and one that few insurers have as a core skill   It is my estimate today that BRK is good at it  unlike most   With Retroactive insurance  typically you are rescuing another insurer from some claim exposure that threatens their existence  The insurer needs certainty  or something near it  and so they approach a much large and stronger insurer to absorb some of the risk of an exposure that is already incurred  but uncertain to to ultimate payout The rescuing insurer will charge a lot  and insist that the rescued insurer still have some risk on the matter  and probably limit its total payout  after which the rescued insurer is on the hook again  That limit will likely be so high that the rescued insurer will say   It s never going to get that high    Fine  and maybe true  but this allows the rescuing insurer to have some certainty itself  that it will never pay an unlimited amount in the rescue For BRK  there is another angle  and that is that retroactive insurance produces a lot of float  and in most cases  Asbestos   Environmental  the float lasts a long time   Thus BRK thinks it has an advantage in investing the float  Together with their size  and the acumen of Ajit Jain  it makes them a unique place for insurers in trouble to seek shelter  for a tidy fee of course That doesn t mean this can t go wrong  but if properly managed  since BRK is one of the few companies that can do this  they probably make very good money on this   Ugh  they have AIG and Swiss Re as clients  which are large savvy firms If they need protection from BRK  and are willing to pay up  guess what   BRK is in the driver s seat  because there is no one in the private sector capable of doing this  Insurance subsidiaries  investments are unusually concentrated and fair values are subject to loss in value  Compared to other insurers  our insurance subsidiaries may concentrate an unusually high percentage of their investments in equity securities and may diversify their investment portfolios far less than is conventional  A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders  equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share  Under certain circumstances  significant declines in the fair values of these investments may require the recognition of losses in the statement of earnings This is potentially BRK s largest weakness  and why I would love to see the statutory books for their insurers   This goes beyond the large public companies that they have purchased   Where are all of the private businesses lodged on the BRK balance sheet   They may be there with really low valuations   I don t know  because I have never looked   and that is why I want to ask BRK for their statutory statements   I believe it would be intriguing Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has guaranteed debt obligations of certain of its subsidiaries  As of December 31  2011  the unpaid balance of subsidiary debt guaranteed by Berkshire totaled approximately  16 billion  Berkshire s guarantee of subsidiary debt is an absolute  unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations  Berkshire also provides guarantees in connection with long term equity index put option and credit default contracts entered into by a subsidiary  The estimated fair value of liabilities recorded under such contracts was approximately  10 0 billion as of December 31  2011  The amount of subsidiary payments under these contracts  if any  is contingent upon future events  The timing of subsidiary payments  if any  will not be fully known for several decades Add in  8 billion of holding company debt  and that is the risk that the holding company faces  which isn t that much for a company the size of BRK   BRK has bought a series of businesses that produce consistent cash flow  so don t worry about holding company debt BRK has more debt than that  but Buffett lets bond investors take the risk by not guaranteeing subsidiary debt   In acquisitions  Buffett never guarantees the debt   But even with new debt issues  many BRK subsidiaries offer their own non BRK guaranteed debt  whether it is Burlington Northern  or a Mid American sub offering debt to back a solar power plant   Now bond investors know the BRK would never walk away from a subsidiary s bonds  right No  actually they don t know that  though Buffett s record has been good with the debts of non guaranteed subsidiaries   Buffett is a better risk than most  but at the subsidiary level  you can t be sure   Buffett could save money and take on more risk by borrowing at the holding company  but he typically does not do that P B Multiple CompressionOver the last decade  BRK s P B multiple has shrunk  and shrunk to the point where Buffett has drawn a line in the sand saying that subject to liquidity and market conditions  he will buy back stock at levels below 110  of stated book value    And  I suspect that is one reason why he spent so much time in the recent letter attempting to explain why the goodwill at BRK represented value    I think that means that there is now a limit  a floor to the price of BRK common stock  of course  subject to continued adequate performance Book Value and Insurers  partly because of the declining P B multiple   I would simply say that this is endemic to an insurance mindset  where all we do care about is growth in net worth  book value    Insurance is a mature  stable business   No one has a way of obsoleting it  so we suspect   It s difficult to start a new insurer of any significant size  so we have protected boundaries to a degree Thus the focus on growing book value   If we grow book value  eventually market value will follow  right  Right  Ugh  I think so  but sometimes I wonder  particularly with all of the insurers trading under book when they have little risk of insolvency   Buffett can draw his line in the sand  but what of other insurers  many of which trade well below book   Should they draw their own line in the sand  and defend a valuation level Personally  I would announce a generalized buyback without a lot of hoopla  make it boring  this is insurance after all so that should not be hard  get some actuaries to toss in big words to aid in obfuscation  so few conclude that the company will buy back significant stock   Then start nibbling  be the bid or just behind it on days when things are weak  Don t be a pig  rule  1 here is that the market should doubt that you are there   But subject to that  buy  buy  BUY  The great Buffett after announcing his buyback only bought back 0 03  of all shares so far   Most insurers can do much more quietly  with far less fanfare   After all  Assurant bought back 14  of its shares last year   Wow   This was the insurer that was offered in full to Buffett  and he said it was too complex  even the great one can goof  Now  maybe Assurant is my extreme case in buying back  and doing it at good valuations  but that in my opinion should be the goal of most public businesses with low valuations that are earning a lot  and not getting the proper respect   Money talks  but be quiet  not brash  and suck in shares quietly at low valuations   Let the financial statements do the bragging for you when investors realize that you have been building value doubly through operations and buybacks SummaryEven if you don t invest with him  you can learn a ton from Buffett   He is a consummate investor  businessman  and insurance executive   Though I have never met him  I consider myself blessed to have learned from him Full disclosure  long

12514,234029,AIZ,This Dividend Stock Drove A Huge 91 6  Gain,opinion,"Let s cut through the thousands of market predictions out there and dive into what s really ahead for your dividends in 2020  We ll also discuss two things that should be high on your  must have  list for any dividend stock you buy this year 
In fact  these two easy to spot indicators handed one group of investors a 91 6  return  with less volatility than your typical investor saw  I ll show you how they did it shortly  First  let s talk about my outlook for the year ahead 
My 2020 Outlook 
Here s why most market predictions miss the mark  the pundits simply look at what happened in the past year and spit out a forecast based on that 
And let s face it  when you look at what stocks did in 2019  you re very likely to think   crash ahead  
2019 Up   2020 Down 






Of course  we always need to be on alert for a pullback  But I ll never take the lazy way out and base anything I do a stock pick  a forecast  whatever on one set of numbers  particularly from just one year 
This calls for a deeper  second level  analysis  And this tells us there are good reasons to expect continued gains in 2020  Consider 
2019 s rise is mostly a mirage  As my colleague    professor  Michael Foster wrote yesterday  most of the 2019 gain was a  snap back  from the late 2018 correction  Stocks are up 10  from late September 2018  when that pullback started  close to their historical return 
Strong years often lead to   strong years  According to Dow Jones Market Data quoted in Barron s  in the year following a year in which it returns 20  or more  the market tends to rise 75  of the time  The average gain  8 9  The presidential election  as I wrote on December 10  according to the Stock Trader s Almanac  since 1952  the market has risen 10 1   on average  during election years when the incumbent is running for a second term  And stocks have only tumbled four times in election years dating back to 1928 
And finally  
The share buyback trend continues  According to a report from Soci t  G n rale  PA SOGN   S P 500 firms will buy  570 billion of their stock in 2020  adding to the 22  of the index s market cap they ve repurchased in the last decade Here s why that last point matters  buybacks cut the number of shares outstanding  driving per share measures like earnings per share  EPS  higher  And since stock prices tend to follow EPS  this can spur a rise in the stock  This is why buybacks are the first  must have  we ll look for in 2020 
When you mix them with our other  must have   strong dividend growth  you ll give yourself a better shot at gaining market beating returns  with less downside risk 
I know this simple two step works because it s helped power my  to an 18 8  annualized total return since we launched in September 2015  well ahead of the 14 8  the S P 500 delivered in that time 

And just a couple weeks ago  we sold one of the stocks we recommended in that very first issue insurer   Assurant    NYSE AIZ  locking in that blockbuster 91 6  return I mentioned earlier 

I mention this now because Assurant is a textbook example of how dividend growth and buybacks can combine to set you up for market beating returns  a bigger income stream and lower volatility 

Let me show you how we did it and how these two ingredients can help you find the next Assurant for your own portfolio   Or better yet  let me do it for you with my 7 very best dividend growth stocks for 2020  which I ll give you instant access to at the end of this article  

The first thing that grabbed my attention about AIZ in 2015  buybacks  Management had jumped on AIZ s cheap valuation and repurchased shares  slashing the share count by 37  in the preceding five years  inspiring a stock that rallied 87  in tandem 
Over the five years we held AIZ  management took another 9 2  of its shares off the market  helping fuel our 91 6  total return 
There was more 

Because here s where step 2 dividend growth came in  I ve written before about how a rising dividend acts like a magnet on the share price  And you can see how AIZ s stock tracked its payout upward during our holding period 
Surging Payout Ignites AIZ and Gives Us Our Exit Cue






Here s another great thing about dividend growth  it helps you answer the tough question of when to sell  too  As you can see  starting in mid 2019  AIZ started running ahead of its dividend  By December  that gap had gotten extreme  We could no longer count on the payout to keep pulling up the shares 
It was time to head for the exit 
Let me leave you with this  while its dividend rose and its share count shrank  AIZ got less volatile during the time we owned it  As you can see below  the stock s beta rating  a volatility measure  a stock with a beta of 1 is as volatile as the S P 500  below 1 is less volatile  declined 
A Steady Grower Gets Steadier






The takeaway here is clear  dividend growers with smart buyback plans are the perfect play for 2020  If the bull keeps running  they ll give you a good chance of outpacing it  And if a correction does hit  they likely won t fall as far as the market and will likely rebound faster 
My Top 7  Dividend Doublers  for 2020  bull or bear 
Look  I m not going to spend this whole column rehashing past calls so let s look to your future and dive into the  
These 7 stout dividend plays are sitting on cash piles they can t send out the door fast enough  And there are plenty of bargains in this bunch  with share prices badly trailing their surging payouts 
It s only a matter of time before they race to catch up nicely positioning you for double digit upside as they do 
As of now  I ve got each of these 7 solid dividend growers pegged to return 20  in dividends and gains  year in and year out  on average  That s enough to double your nest egg every four years
