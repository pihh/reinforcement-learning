146108,367623,ALXN,Apellis  Lead Drug Tops Alexion s Blockbuster Soliris in a Pivotal Late Stage Study,news,"Apellis Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ APLS  announced results on Tuesday from its Pegasus late stage clinical study evaluating experimental drug pegcetacoplan  APL 2  in treating adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH   a rare blood disorder  The biotech company stated that pegcetacoplan achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of the study by producing greater improvement in patients  hemoglobin levels than Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  Soliris 
This news caused Apellis stock to soar more than 20  Tuesday morning  Alexion s share price opened down more than 3  but later rebounded 

Digging into the results
The Pegasus study included 41 patients receiving pegcetacoplan and 39 patients receiving Soliris  Apellis reported that pegcetacoplan achieved an improvement in the adjusted means of 3 8 grams per deciliter of hemoglobin at week 16 of the study compared to Soliris with a high level of statistical significance  The company also said that its drug  showed promising results  on key secondary endpoints including avoiding transfusions and reducing fatigue  Pegcetacoplan s safety profile was similar to that of Soliris  
Those results were better than Apellis anticipated  CEO Cedric Francois stated   Going into the study  our most optimistic expectation was to see a 2 g dL or more change in hemoglobin and a trend on the key secondary endpoints  Needless to say  we are thrilled with these results  
Pegcetacoplan is the first drug to beat Soliris in improving hemoglobin levels in patients with PNH  The Pegasus results point to the possibility that Apellis  drug could become the new standard of care in treating the rare blood disorder 
Next steps for Apellis
Apellis plans to present detailed results from the Pegasus study at a future scientific meeting  The company also hopes to meet with regulators in the first half of 2020 to discuss the pathway to approval for pegcetacoplan ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pez5u,2054209

The phase II study  PULSAR  is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotatercept in PAH patients  The primary endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance  PVR  over a 24 week treatment period 
In the study  106 patients were randomized to receive placebo  0 3 mg kg of sotatercept  or 0 7 mg kg of sotatercept subcutaneously  every 21 days  in combination with stable background PAH specific therapies over a 24 week treatment period 
The study results showed that the candidate demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PVR  the trial s primary endpoint  at week 24 versus placebo  PVR  as measured by right heart catheterization  is the resistance that the heart must overcome to pump blood through the pulmonary circulatory system 
The study also achieved statistically significant improvements in the key secondary endpoint of six minute walk distance  6MWD  and other secondary endpoints  including amino terminal brain natriuretic propeptide  NT proBNP  and World Health Organization  WHO  functional class 
The candidate was generally well tolerated 
Moreover  97 out of the 106 patients are currently participating in the 18 month extension period of the study 
Additional results will be presented later in the year

morning everyone  Before we review our fourth quarter and 2019 full year performance  I would like to take a brief moment to announce that we have successfully closed on our acquisition of Achillion Pharmaceuticals  which represents an important step in diversifying our business  Through this acquisition  we had two clinical stage assets to our portfolio  with danicopan and 5228  We are thrilled to welcome our Achillion colleagues to Alexion and excited about the opportunity to collaborate on the development of these Factor D assets for a broad range of rare diseases Turning now to our 2019 performance  we delivered on all of our key objectives  and in many cases have surpassed our goals  ULTOMIRIS is now the market leader in PNH  in our three largest markets  the U S   Germany and Japan  The ULTOMIRIS HUS conversion is progressing well in the U S   and we anticipate launching in the EU and Japan this year We are also very pleased with the uptake of our neurology franchise  with continued growth of SOLIRIS in gMG and the launch in NMOSD  In just over two years  neurology has become our largest franchise in the U S  by patient volumes  Our ambition is to quadruple the number of MG and NMOSD patients treated by SOLIRIS  and eventually ULTOMIRIS in the U S  by 2025  Our metabolics portfolio continues to deliver strong growth  as we work to expand access for HPP and LAL D patients Importantly  we have made great progress on our pipeline and have an ambition for 10 launches from now until the end of 2023  through a combination of new assets  new formulations and new indications  And once again have delivered on our financials  with 21  revenue growth and 33  non GAAP earnings growth in 2019 Turning to slide 6  we have a clear strategy for long term value creation  First  we will move past SOLIRIS and establish ULTOMIRIS as market leader in PNH and HUS  in our three key geographies  Secondly  we will expand our C5 franchise beyond PNH and HUS into larger rare diseases  We have ULTOMIRIS programs planned in six new indications  including four neurology  and two nephrology indications  In parallel  we will continue to innovate for patients with new formulations and subcu treatment options Finally  we will diversify our portfolio beyond C5  Achillion is the most recent example of this effort  With Factor D  we have the opportunity to pursue development in a broad range of indications  Outside of this transaction  we have built a robust rare disease pipeline over the past few years  and have clear line of sight to multiple potential blockbuster launches  including treatments for Wilson Disease and AL amyloidosis  We have significant financial capacity to continue to diversify our pipeline in the future In addition to bringing in external assets to diversify our business  we are evolving our leadership in complement to expand our addressable patient population  On slide 7  you can see our business is rapidly moving beyond SOLIRIS  ULTOMIRIS is approved for two indications OperatorLadies and gentlemen  please standby  Please continue to standby  While we are experiencing technical difficulties  Ladies and gentlemen  please continue to standby  Ladies and gentlemen  thank you for your patience and please continue to standby  You may resume Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerYes hi  this is Ludwig Hantson  We had a technical issue  I hope that you guys can hear us OK  So what I will do is  instead of restarting  we re going to start on slide 6 and then we will take it from there So turning to slide 6  we have a clear strategy for long term value creation  First  we will move past SOLIRIS and establish ULTOMIRIS as market leader in PNH and HUS in our three key geographies  Secondly  we will expand our C5 franchise beyond PNH and HUS into larger rare diseases  We have ULTOMIRIS programs planned and six new indications  including four neurology and two nephrology indications  In parallel  we will continue to innovate for patients with new formulations and subcu treatment options Finally we will diversify our portfolio beyond C5  Achillion is the most recent example of this effort  With Factor D  we have the opportunity to pursue development in a broad range of indications  Outside of this transaction  we have built a robust rare disease pipeline over the past few years and have clear line of sight to multiple potential blockbuster launches  including treatments for Wilson Disease and AL amyloidosis We have significant financial capacity to continue to diversify our pipeline in the future  In addition to bringing in external assets to diversify our business  we are evolving our leadership and complement to expand our addressable patient population  On slide 7  you can see our business is rapidly moving beyond SOLIRIS  ULTOMIRIS is approved for two indications and in development for six additional indications  across neurology and nephrology  This year  we will transition to a high concentration formulation  which will shorten infusions to only 45 minutes  Next year  we plan to launch our once weekly  on body subcu ULTOMIRIS formulation  offering patients a home based self administration option  Our next generation subcu assets  1810 and 1720 offer improved patient dosing regimens  and we have significant optionality for indication selection with each of these assets  From there  we will expand with Achillion s Factor D platform  We see immense opportunity for oral proximal complement treatments  to transform standard of care in many complement mediated diseases On slide 8  you see that once again  we have delivered strong top and bottom line growth for the fourth quarter and the full year  which provides a solid foundation to continue to deliver on our value creation strategy  Again  I m very pleased with our strong execution against our 2019 priorities and excited for 2020  as we build on our successes With that I will now turn the call over to Aradhana Aradhana Sarin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Ludwig  Starting with slide 10  we reported fourth quarter total revenues of approximately  1 4 billion  an increase of 23  year over year  This was driven by strength in our neurology franchise  continued growth in the core businesses and ULTOMIRIS launch Our non GAAP operating margin was 51   a reduction of 155 basis points versus prior year  driven by increased R D spend  as we advanced and further build our development portfolio  Non GAAP EPS was  2 71  representing 27  growth year over year  driven primarily by strong top line growth and lower effective tax rate Moving to slide 11  fourth quarter total net product sales were primarily driven by patient volume growth in our key markets  Turning to slide 12  SOLIRIS revenues in the fourth quarter were approximately  1 billion  with year over year growth of 4   SOLIRIS revenue growth was driven primarily by gMG revenues  partially offset by ULTOMIRIS conversion dynamics  ULTOMIRIS revenues in the fourth quarter were  170 million  which now includes contributions from atypical HUS in the United States  Metabolics revenues in the fourth quarter were  201 million  representing 32  year over year growth Turning to the P L on slide 13  during the quarter  non GAAP R D expense was  227 million or 16  of revenues  Non GAAP SG A expense was  340 million or 25  of revenues  The non GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 12   and continued to benefit from certain one time events  including the release of state income tax reserves related to the conclusion of an audit We reported fourth quarter non GAAP EPS of  2 71  growing 27  year over year  GAAP earnings per share were  4  We ended the fourth quarter with approximately  2 7 billion in cash and marketable securities  This is not adjusted for the Achillion transaction I ll now turn to slide 14 for our 2020 financial guidance  We are guiding to total revenues between  5 5 billion and  5 56 billion  this represents 11  growth year over year at the midpoint of the range  For SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS  our revenue guidance is  4 755 billion to  4 800 billion  This assumes continued momentum for SOLIRIS in gMG  our ongoing launch of SOLIRIS in NMOSD  and the launches of ULTOMIRIS for PNH and atypical HUS Turning to metabolics  our revenue guidance is  745 million to  760 million for both STRENSIQ and KANUMA  This includes the impact of the strategic pricing decision for STRENSIQ in the U S  to support sustainability and access  given weight based dosing  In 2020 and beyond  it is important to consider the dynamics associated with conversion from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS  as it relates to the annual cost per patient There is a revenue benefit when each patient starts ULTOMIRIS PNH treatment due to the increased number of vials consumed during the loading dose  We benefited from this loading dose dynamic  having converted 60  plus of patients in PNH to ULTOMIRIS over the course of 2019  We now expect to be impacted by lower annual treatment cost per patient  as the majority of patients move to maintenance dosing In atypical HUS and other indications and development  we will see a lower annual cost per patient compared to SOLIRIS for both loading dose and maintenance dosing  It is also important to consider quarter over quarter variability due to every eight week dosing for ULTOMIRIS  However  this quarterly fluctuation will even out on an annual basis We have included a slide in the appendix of this presentation  to provide a summary of this dynamic  and to serve as a reference  going forward  Non GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 53 5  and 54 5  of revenues  Non GAAP R D expense is expected to be between 17 5  and 18 5  of revenues  and represents a step up of approximately  270 million versus prior year  consistent with our intention to further build out and progress the pipeline Clinical program spend  particularly for late stage development  is planned to increase in 2020  R D expense also includes program costs and potential milestones for previously announced BD transactions and collaborations  Non GAAP SG A spend is expected to be between 19 5  and 20 5  of revenues for the full year 2020  and reflect increased leverage from topline growth We expect the non GAAP effective tax rate to be between 16  and 17   In 2019  the non GAAP effective tax rate benefited from certain one time items  Absent these one time benefits  our 2019 non GAAP tax rate would have been approximately 15   We expect our non GAAP effective tax rate to increase in the future  as a result of tax regulation changes outside the U S GAAP EPS is expected to be between  7 91 and  8 71  Non GAAP EPS is expected to be between  10 65 and  10 85  The midpoint of the non GAAP EPS is approximately 2  growth year over year  as a result of increased R D spend  and an increased tax rate  compared to prior year  This guidance reflects the financial impact of our recently closed Achillion acquisition  but does not reflect any future M A that we may pursue As you can see on slide 15  we have established a track record of strong financial execution  Since 2017  we have delivered double digit total revenue and non GAAP EPS growth  while maintaining a competitive  non GAAP operating margin  We continue to invest in our R D programs and have increased our non GAAP R D spend as a percentage of revenues  to within 16  to 19   in line with our biotech peers With the current momentum of the business  we are well positioned to deliver on our 2020 financial goals I ll now turn the call over to John  to provide an update on R D John Orloff    Executive Vice President and Head of Research   DevelopmentThank you  Aradhana  On slide 17  you can see our current development portfolio  We now have 19 planned clinical stage development programs for 2020  In the coming weeks and months  we expect to report interim data from our Phase III once weekly on body subcutaneous ULTOMIRIS program  an update on our anti FcRn studies  and interim data from the Phase II study of danicopan in C3G We re excited about the acquisition of Achillion and look forward to providing additional detail in the coming months  as we embark on the integration  Just a few weeks ago  we reiterated our ambition to execute 10 launches by 2023 from our current portfolio  On slide 18  you can see our R D highlights  which summarize these programs  including stage and clinical development  and the estimated addressable population We are expanding our C5 presence well beyond the PNH and atypical HUS business  and are advancing ULTOMIRIS into five additional indications across neurology and nephrology  Together  the ULTOMIRIS programs present an opportunity to expand our treated patient population by tens of thousands of patients  We believe in the compelling value proposition of ULTOMIRIS  which has been received well by patients  physicians and other key stakeholders  and are continuing to innovate with a high those concentration  reducing infusion time to 45 minutes and a once weekly on body ULTOMIRIS subcutaneous formulation In addition to ULTOMIRIS indication expansion programs  we see opportunity to diversify our business beyond C5 with four additional late stage novel assets  Our Phase III superiority trial for ALXN1840 and Wilson s Disease remains ongoing  1840 is an oral once daily therapy  with 10 000 fold higher affinity for copper than current standard of care chelators  which have poor compliance rates  due to burdensome dosing regimens  We are on the verge of completing enrollment and expect the top line readout in the first half of next year We plan to initiate a Phase II III program for CAEL 101 in AL amyloidosis in the coming months  We see potential for this late stage asset to transform the treatment of AL amyloidosis  a disease characterized by misfolded kappa and lambda light change  resulting an abnormal deposits of amyloid  which can lead to organ failure  Patients are currently treated with a chemotherapeutic agents  not approved for amyloidosis  and median survival rates are only 18 months post diagnosis  Clinical data supporting our rationale for the collaboration  showed a 63  overall organ response rate  in addition to efficacy on cardiac and renal endpoints  Our Phase II III program will look at an overall survival primary endpoint  with patient function  quality of life cardiac imaging  serving secondary endpoints Last year  we announced a license agreement with Eidos  to develop and commercialize AG10 for ATTR cardiomyopathy in Japan  AG10 is a small molecule  designed to address destabilized and misfolded transthyretin protein  which is the root cause of ATTR  We believe AG10 has potential to stabilize TTR  and halt disease progression  Pending regulatory discussions  we plan to extend the AG10 development program into Japan later this year Finally  we are excited about our acquisition of Achillion  and in its Factor D platform  Achillion reported positive Phase II data for danicopan in PNH patients with extravascular hemolysis at a medical conference last year  We see opportunity for danicopan in the small subset of PNH patients with extravascular hemolysis  We see additional opportunity for danicopan in C3G  and expect interim Phase II data in the coming weeks  and we see great potential for ACH 5228  as twice daily best in class Factor D oral treatment in PNH  and a broad range of rare diseases We are excited about the opportunity for these 10 potential launches to significantly expand the number of treated patients  and look forward to providing you with updates  as we progress through the year Moving to slide 19  we have plans to further expand and diversify our C5 leadership  with our next generation assets  Starting on the left  our weekly subcutaneous formulation of ULTOMIRIS for use in PNH in atypical HUS is in an ongoing Phase III PK based trial  Leveraging the WestGen  Phonetic  on body device  we believe this will provide patients with the flexibility to choose how they wish to manage their disease within their lifestyle  We are expecting interim PK data in the second quarter of this year with a potential launch in 2021 Next  we have the opportunity to evolve our terminal complement subcutaneous treatment options with ALXN1720 and ALXN1810  ALXN1720 is our internally designed bi specific C5 inhibitor  At only 25 kilodaltons  ALXN1720 is a unique mini body tailor made for convenience subcutaneous administration  We see opportunity for this asset in a number of larger rare disease indications and we look to initiate a proof of concept study in the first half of next year Finally  ALXN1810 is our co formulation of ULTOMIRIS and Halozyme s PH20 hyaluronidase  which allows for bi weekly subcutaneous dosing  We recently disclosed our plans to start a Phase II renal basket trial with ALXN1810 and look forward to providing additional updates  as this program progresses  Together  these three assets represent an opportunity for Alexion to expand our offerings for patients living with complement mediated rare disease  Our development portfolio has grown significantly in the last two and a half years  and I m incredibly proud of all the hard work undertaken by the entire R D organization With that  I ll turn the call over to Brian to provide commercial highlights for the quarter  Brian Brian Goff    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercial and Global Operations OfficerThank you  John  Turning first to slide 22  we ve seen unprecedented progress    in establishing ULTOMIRIS as the market leader in PNH  This is due in large part to the compelling value proposition  which include strong data from the largest and most inclusive PNH clinical program ever conducted  The broad inclusion criteria in the two Phase III trials in shorter  Phonetic  study patient population  would be representative of the real world PNH population Specifically  we enrolled transfusion independent and transfusion dependent patients  with no baseline hemoglobin or absolute reticulocyte count requirements  We also included patients with prior history of bone marrow failure  which is critical  because roughly 40  to 50  PNH patients have a history of bone marrow failure or aplastic anemia As of Monday of this week  we ve converted 60  of PNH patients to ULTOMIRIS in the U S   62  in Germany and 53  in Japan  making ULTOMIRIS the PNH market leader in our three largest volume countries  Our latest launch of ULTOMIRIS in atypical HUS in the U S  is also off to a strong start  While it s still early days  conversion is tracking in line  with the PNH conversion curve at the same time point  since launch Our neurology business is now our largest franchise by patient volume  and this was achieved in just two years since launch  On slide 23  you can see we exited the fourth quarter with 1 885 patients on treatment with SOLIRIS for gMG and NMOSD in the U S  We ve made significant progress advancing our presence in gMG and with our NMOSD launch  gMG patients continue to have broad access to SOLIRIS  Our strong NMOSD launch is underpinned by a remarkable Phase III data  showing 98  of patients relapse free at 48 weeks  with sustained efficacy out to three years We re making progress educating payers on the severity of NMOSD attacks  the objective of preventing all relapses  and the difference between NMOSD and MS  As a result of these efforts  payer adoption of coverage policies for NMOSD has been rapid  and we re seeing strong adherence to SOLIRIS therapy in both gMG and NMOSD Looking ahead  we re well positioned to deliver on our ambition of quadrupling our U S  GMG and NMOSD treated patient population within the next five years  With potential for ULTOMIRIS to launch in late 2022 or early 2023  as an every eight week infusion Our once weekly  on body subcutaneous formulation planned to launch simultaneously with the IV formulation  will provide another important treatment option for patients  who prefer self or home based administration  Our target gMG population represents more severe uncontrolled patients  and we believe this is a unique space  where SOLIRIS and then ULTOMIRIS can serve as a highly effective treatment option  In NMOSD  our target patient population mirrors inclusion criteria in our Phase 3 SOLIRIS PREVENT trial  With our dedicated neurology team  we believe our commercial organization is well positioned to deliver on our 2025 ambitions  I d like to take a brief moment to thank both our global commercial and global operations organizations  for their hard work and dedication  which has enabled us to excel with multiple launches  and continue to bring hope to the rare disease patients we serve I ll now turn the call back to Ludwig for closing comments  Ludwig Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Brian  Once again  I m very proud of what the team delivered in 2019  We re well positioned to further build on our momentum in 2020  and there is much to look forward to this year  We have laid out a clear strategy  to deliver long term shareholder value  by establishing ULTOMIRIS as market leader in PNH and HUS  expanding our presence in C5  including planned programs in neurology and nephrology  and continue to look for opportunities to diversify our business beyond C5 Importantly  we maintain our unwavering focus on patients and our commitment to advance our mission to deliver life changing therapies to people living with rare diseases With that  we will now open the call to questions  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan  Your line is open Cory Kasimov    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  Good morning  guys  Thank you for taking the question  I guess I just want to get a better sense of the drivers behind your guidance for 2020  particularly on the top line  On the surface it looks pretty conservative  is this primarily just a function of the pricing dynamic of assuming more ULTOMIRIS patients on maintenance dosing this year  Or are there other factors that are also important behind the scenes that I m missing Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerYeah Aradhana  The answer is  yes  you re right  But go ahead Aradhana Sarin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo first of all  we had an amazing year in 2019  21  top line growth  33  EPS growth  exceeded all our conversion targets  six BD deals  so 2019 was an amazing year  On 2020  we have guided to 11  top line growth  So there are few dynamics that are going on here  First of all  we had    because we had great conversion from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS in 2019  as we go into 2020  there will be an impact to revenues  due to the lower annual cost of treatment per patient  as majority of patients have now already converted  and will now go into maintenance dosing  that s on the PNH side On the atypical HUS side  we re just starting to launch ULTOMIRIS  There  we do not have the loading dose benefit  There in fact  on the first year  there is a 22  lower price per patient annual treatment cost  and in year two  there is a 33  lower treatment cost annually for the patient  As a result  that dynamic also is sort of a headwind from a revenue standpoint  This is to some extent mitigated by our neurology growth  As you know  we put out our ambition for neurology  having four times the number of patients by 2025  So we re still seeing strong neurology growth on the patient volume side  In addition  we re also seeing high single digit growth for PNH and atypical HUS patients  and our metabolics business continues to grow as well  So it s a mix of all these different factors that impact the top line On the bottom line  there are several other factors that impact the EPS guidance  As you can see  our R D spend is going up substantially  It s about a  270 million increase on a dollar basis  and it s 19 clinical programs that you ve heard about  many of which we did not have in 2018 or 2019  In addition  the R D spend also includes the spend that we will have  as a result of the close of the Achillion transaction  In addition  the R D spend includes the BD transactions that we ve already announced  and the milestones that we expect to pay for those transactions  as those programs move forward In addition  you see that the tax rate  which was on a non GAAP basis  13  in 2019 is on the midpoint  expected to be between 16  and 17  or 16 5   So that s about 350 basis points change from 2019  So those are some of the factors that impact the bottom line Cory Kasimov    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerDoes that answer your question Cory Kasimov    JP Morgan    AnalystYes it does  The color is very helpful  Thank you very much Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  We ll take the next question  operator OperatorOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Bank of America  Your line is open Geoff Meacham    Bank of America    AnalystGood morning  guys  thanks for the question  I just have a couple of quick ones  For Brian   Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerGeoff  do you just mind speaking up a little bit  its very difficult to hear you  Yeah  Is that better  Okay  let s try Geoff Meacham    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  So for Brian on ULTOMIRIS conversion  are there differences between PNH and aHUS  and down the road NMO and MG  with respect to conversion from SOLIRIS  I wasn t sure if there are nuances between the indications  or if the 70  target was broadly applicable  And then  Ludwig  just curious if there have been further dialog with    between you and Elliott  since the announcement and maybe just highlight where you see the biggest differences between    and opinion between the strategies going forward  Thank you Brian Goff    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercial and Global Operations OfficerHey Geoff  it s Brian  I ll start  On the on the conversion  first of all  your comment on  is the 70  broadly applicable to our base business of PNH and atypical HUS  the answer is yes  We have the same ambition  Of course  we ve made excellent progress on PNH and as we ve reported now in our three largest markets  with PNH  we are over the 50  mark  So ULTOMIRIS is definitively the market leader  Atypical HUS is a different dynamic in terms of conversion  because it s a more acute condition  So you have many of the patients  who will start in the inpatient setting  and they may actually start on SOLIRIS  But then  as soon as they are discharged  there is an opportunity for facilitated patient conversion to ULTOMIRIS  and part of that is  hospital formulary dynamics and part is just awareness of ULTOMIRIS availability  But again  same ambition And the other half of your question was around neurology  and I guess here you re asking about with SOLIRIS  because it s too premature to talk about ULTOMIRIS in neurology  And there are very different dynamics between gMG and NMOSD  Though we re really pleased with the progress we re making with both launches  gMG as you know is two years and counting  and in the U S   we continue to make progress in both breadth of prescribing as well as depth of prescribing In NMOSD  we began that journey in the middle part of last year  The launch is very much on track  and we gave the combined numbers of    as of the end of last year  1 885 patients  So that starting point of two years with gMG and six months plus with NMOSD  and the progress we ve made  has really fed our ambition to be at four times  within five years from now Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerWith respect to your second question  Geoff  so we continue to have a constructive dialog with Elliott  as we have with all of our shareholders  As you know  our dialog with Elliott started in 2017 and we listened very carefully to all of you  We also believe that  we have a stock that is undervalued  especially given our strong execution in    so the management team  including the Board  believes that we have a strong strategy and that we need to continue to focus on executing that strategy  and that will create long term shareholder value  There is not much more that I can add to that  Operator  can we take the next question OperatorOur next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink  Your line is open Geoffrey Porges    SVB Leerink    AnalystOkay  thanks  Couple of questions  First Aradhana  just on the guidance  so it sounds to me as though you re saying that ULTOMIRIS is going to be sort of flattish to down  because there is obviously a strong underlying trend in SOLIRIS  So if I just take the Q4 revenue run rate and carry it forward  then I get to your guidance for 2020  So it sounds as though you re telling us  that ULTOMIRIS is actually going to go down compared to the Q4 run rate  because of the dose shift  and I just want to make sure that s clear  And then another communication clarification question  your 10 launches by 2023  is that what you see being possible  or is that your strategic commitment  Meaning if some of those  which are clearly high risk such as ALS or even the Caelum program  if they fall by the wayside and the trials aren t successful  will you add other programs to ensure that you deliver 10 by 2023  I just want to understand how to think about that  Thanks Aradhana Sarin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So I ll address the first question and then John can address the second question  So I don t think it s accurate to assume that ULTOMIRIS revenues are actually going down  We expect ULTOMIRIS revenues to still go up for a number of reasons  First of all  we ve only converted say around 60  of the market in our three major geographies  and there is still a long way to go  on the PNH side  Secondly  we just started launching ULTOMIRIS and atypical HUS  and that s a conversion dynamic that we will see Now  there is a mix of both volume as well as price  and you ve been    you can see in the appendix  the pricing dynamic  So we still expect the conversion to drive the volume and there will obviously be some price headwind  as a result of the lower annual cost per patient  That will be balanced by    on the SOLIRIS side  strong growth on the neurology franchise  as well as on the metabolic side  both of those businesses still continue to grow very well Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We have     170 million for the quarter  So we have a run rate of  680 million  We plan to do much better than that  Geoff  It s almost no HUS sales in 2019 and U S  is picking up and Brian was talking about the fact that the HUS conversion to ULTOMIRIS is similar to what we ve seen with PNH  which is best in class  Plus  we think that we re on a good track to get European HUS approval before mid of this year  So that will come in as Plus every month  we have another country globally that s launching ULTOMIRIS  So ULTOMIRIS is going to grow substantially And then  with respect to your question on your 10 launches John Orloff    Executive Vice President and Head of Research   DevelopmentYeah  So Geoff  Hi  Its John  I think the 10 launches is clearly our ambition  We believe it s an achievable ambition  Five of those launches are related to ULTOMIRIS  which we think is de risked  based on the data we have so far  Many of those are in disease areas where we ve already established proof of concept and mechanism  The other five relates to new assets  two of those are danicopan and Factor D  where we think we have a strong supporting data  And as you indicate  we continue to press the envelope  if you will  with regard to business development  and bringing in new assets that we think we will be able to kind of plug and play  And so we think that s    it s highly achievable  and if one or more of those fall off  then we have other opportunities as well  that we haven t really talked about  both internally  as well as potentially  through external innovation Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerDoes that answer your questions  Geoff  Next question OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Sandler  Your line is open Christopher Raymond    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks for taking the question  Just noticing in your slides  I guess it s slide 12 specifically  it looks like there s a lot more growth in Q4 for ULTOMIRIS in APAC or the rest of the world versus EU  Maybe just if you could talk about the assumptions you made in 2020 for Europe versus the rest of world or APAC on ULTOMIRIS  And also maybe  can you quantify any Russian biosimilar impact for ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS  And then maybe just a guidance question around you    just on the R D  can you maybe put some brackets around what those milestones are and maybe quantify some of that impact  Thank you Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  maybe I start with Russia  As a matter of fact  you might know how the Russian market works  but    out of the C5 business in Russia  should you expect any ULTOMIRIS business in Russia moving forward  the answer is not really Then on your second question on APAC fourth quarter  loading Aradhana Sarin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So the APAC fourth quarter that you see  it s really driven by Japan  and as we launched PNH ULTOMIRIS in Japan  there was very strong uptake  We have shared numbers with you in the past  and that was the loading dose benefit that I talked about for the PNH patients given the pricing and the volume difference  So that explains the APAC numbers Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerAnd then we have a question on the milestones Aradhana Sarin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we ve made public our various partnerships  both on Caelum and Affibody and Dicerna and so forth  and as those programs progress  there ll be milestones owed  I don t think we re breaking down how much is milestones versus not  And then also that  270 million increase  includes the impact of the Achillion transaction and you can estimate sort of how much that spend would be  given  we plan to progress both danicopan and 5228 forward this year Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  we will take the next question OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Schimmer of Evercore ISI  Your line is open Josh Schimmer    Evercore    AnalystThanks for taking the question  I might have missed it  but was there any other contributing factors for the strong performance of SOLIRIS in the U S   given some of the growth drivers  but still a little bit above where I might have expected  And then for SOLIRIS in Japan  with new repricing rule  this label expansion  does the NMO indication addition    is that going to change the price point for SOLIRIS  And if so  how  Thank you Brian Goff    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercial and Global Operations OfficerHi Josh  it s Brian  With SOLIRIS in the U S   I think what you have are mostly a story around neurology  and we re really pleased with the growth that we ve had with gMG  as well as the launch of NMOSD  which again began in July  and that has progressed very nicely  We also    and this is more for SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS  which goes back to your earlier questions as well  In addition to all the conversion dynamics that we talk about  we continue to identify new naive patients with PNH as well as atypical HUS as well  And as we ve indicated  we see that continuing in high single digits and low double digit growth pattern  So that s feeding it additionally Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  We ll take the next question OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Kostas Biliouris    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  this is Kostas on for Matthew  I have a question based on your FcRn gMG study  which is now a Phase II in second half 2020  I m wondering whether there has been any delay to the initiation of this study versus prior expectations  And a follow up question  what do you need to advance this study to the Phase III  Thank you John Orloff    Executive Vice President and Head of Research   DevelopmentYes  thank you  So we have two anti FcRn programs  One is    we have this Syntimmune acquisition  which is 1830  that s back in the clinic now  You may recall that last year  we had a CMC issue that we ve addressed  We have now have new drug product that s been delivered  We initiated with a higher concentration formulation subcutaneously to healthy volunteers that began in December  and we are reinitiating the Phase II program with the IV formulation in hemolytic anemia this quarter  which was also paused for the same reason  So we will complete those dose ranging trials and then be in a position to launch pivotal programs later this year  And with regard to myasthenia gravis  we may need to do some additional dose ranging upfront there  that would be a seamless Phase II III type of trial  And then of course progressing further with hemolytic anemia So no additional delays in the program  We re pressing ahead Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerNext question OperatorOur next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of SunTrust Robinson  Your line is open Robyn Karnauskas    SunTrust Robinson    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  Ludwig  just quickly  on the 20 000 eligible target population for MG that you ve noted  How are you thinking about that in terms of that impact to price and the ability to capture that  given the competitive landscape  And then along with that  you ve talked about  you have a way to go still with converging already at 60   with the 70  you had set out originally as a goal  How do we think about bottlenecks for conversion going forward  How quickly could that slow or just any color you could provide  so we could figure out how to model that correctly  Thank you John Orloff    Executive Vice President and Head of Research   DevelopmentHi Robyn  Let me start with the first one on the the approximately 20 000 patient addressable opportunity for ULTOMIRIS in gMG  So the way that we see the gMG market evolving is  first of all as we ve talked about many times  SOLIRIS continues to occupy a relatively  let s call it narrow segment of the larger gMG population  It s about 8 0000 patients  which are uncontrolled  more severe patients  And that really aligns with the regain pivotal Phase III study  We are not by the way  limited from a label perspective to stay in that 8 000 patients  but that has in the last two years  that has really been the sweet spot for SOLIRIS As we move into the opportunity with launch of ULTOMIRIS  based on the trial design that John and the team have put forward  we see that that space expanding such that the burden of previous IST cycles of therapy is not as high as it was for regain  and we see that opening up a larger segment for ULTOMIRIS Now  to your point about price  I mean  neurology is one aspect of price that we will continue to assess  But as we ve said  we have eight indications that we ve announced  that we re pursuing for ULTOMIRIS  And as those unfold  we have consistently said we maintain price flexibility to align the volume opportunity  with the value that ULTOMIRIS offers  and so we ll  we ll stay on that path Your second question was around the continued conversion dynamics  We still maintain the same ambition of 70  within two years of our launch markets  We are well on track with that  We ve talked with a lot of pride about the three largest markets  we have worldwide  U S   Germany  Japan  The only real bottlenecks that we see  and I wouldn t even call them bottlenecks  it s largely a function of time  is moving from so called centers of excellence of treatment with PNH  higher volume centers  as well as with the atypical HUS  to a broader customer segment  and that just takes time for us to continue to penetrate Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerCan we take the next question  operator OperatorOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citi  Your line is open Mohit Bansal    Citigroup    AnalystGreat  thanks for taking my question  So just switching toward danicopan as well as 5528 strategy  the doctors seem to like the alternative pathway a lot  and 4471 is clearly not  Indecipherable  monotherapy  But could you please help us understand  what would you want to see with 5528  in terms of profile of the drug  which could potentially make it a viable monotherapy or potentially a frontline agent  ahead of C5  Thank you John Orloff    Executive Vice President and Head of Research   DevelopmentSure  So first of all  we are committed to progressing the clinical development plans that Achillion has already communicated publicly in PNH with 4471  that s completed the Phase II data that we shared at ASH in December  and now planning to move forward with a Phase III study in PNH patients with extravascular hemolysis  At the same time  there is an ongoing Phase II study with 5228 which has better PK characteristics  It has got a longer half life  the half life being about 12 hours  and also has better activity against the alternative pathway  with more than 90  inhibition of that pathway  So we re really excited about that compound  in order to give it less frequently  and it s greater potency that allows us to expand potentially into new opportunities beyond those with the EVA  So there is a Phase II program going on now  that is looking at it  not only on top of C5 inhibition  but also as monotherapy And then I would say  lastly that we re very excited about the opportunities beyond PNH in additional disease areas  that we haven t operated in  where the alternative pathway has been implicated  and where there are exciting opportunities to treat more patients with rare disease Mohit Bansal    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  Helpful Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerWe will take the last question OperatorAnd our last question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets  Your line is open Kennen MacKay    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the progress throughout 2019 and into the New Year  Maybe a question for Brian  the PNH switch execution has been beyond phenomenal in in the U S   can you maybe help us understand how we should be thinking about the pace of switching in AHUS versus PNH  given differences in presentation and disease morbidity Brian Goff    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercial and Global Operations OfficerYeah  Hey Kennen  Beyond phenomenal  I wrote that one down  so thanks a lot Kennen MacKay    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystPut that in your review Brian Goff    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercial and Global Operations OfficerThe dynamics  as I noted earlier  the dynamics between atypical HUS in PNH are different  But of course  the profile of ULTOMIRIS is the same  and we get the same compelling feedback from patients  from physicians  and certainly from payers  And in fact as Aradhana had noted  the economics on an annual cost of therapy play out even more favorably for atypical HUS with ULTOMIRIS versus SOLIRIS  So I think what we re going to see are different dynamics in terms of inpatient  outpatient starts  But the same 70  ambition and just a couple of months in the launch  we are pleased with how we re tracking  So thanks for the question Ludwig Hantson    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  perfect  Operator  I ll take it from here  I have two topics that I want to close the the meeting with  The first topic is the state of our business  The second one is an update on IP With respect to our business  I believe we have a very healthy business  We talked about the fact that we have a healthy top line growth moving forward  In    driven by volume growth  this is not about price increases  We drive our business through to volume and innovation  We believe we have a healthy R D pipeline and that s why we say we    our ambition is to launch 10 products  new indications  new formulations by 2023  and that s the way it should be for a biotech organization  Then we have an operating margin that is very attractive within our industry  We are now around the mid 50s  We come from the lower 40s  and we believe that s a very healthy operating margin space to play in  so we really feel good about all of this  and this is reflected in our guidance The second topic  as I said is IP  So I have an update  And some of you might have seen that  the U S  Patent Office has allowed a new patent for SOLIRIS  providing additional patent protection in the U S  through 2027  And the new patent covers the methods of treating PNH with SOLIRIS  which is a method of used patents  Just to remind you  we also have an existing patent covering a method of use for HUS with SOLIRIS  which expires in 2032  and none of those two patents have been challenged  Its important that you guys know all the details of what s going on in the U S  Patent Office With that  we ll close the call  Thank you for dialing in  I am really excited about the progress that we re making and hope you will enjoy the rest of your day  Thank you Operator Operator Closing Remarks  Duration  60 minutesCall participants Morgan Sanford    Director of Investor

146246,367761,ALXN,3 Biotech Stocks Likely To Maintain Solid Momentum In 2020,opinion,It has been a roller coaster ride for the volatile biotech sector in 2019 after a disappointing run in 2018  The year started with a bang for this sector  with the announcement of the mega merger of bigwigs Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   This significantly perked up the prices of quite a few stocks  However  these were partially offset by the overall weakness in the global market  Nevertheless  the sector has again picked up in the past couple of months  primarily owing to the recent spree of mergers and acquisitions  and positive pipeline readouts Overall  the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has seen 23 2  growth in the past year Relatively  the biotech sector continued being riskier than the more stable  industry or the overall medical sector  as investors are mostly banking on companies with very few approved drugs in the portfolios A slowdown in mature products due to increasing competition and the rise of biosimilars forced most pharma biotech behemoths to target lucrative buyouts in the biotech space to bolster their portfolios   In particular  biotechs  both small and big   which have a dominant position in the lesser competitive arena of rare diseases  gene therapy and NASH  and are well equipped with path breaking technologies  are significant acquisition targets A slew of licensing and buyout deals was struck by most companies eyeing smaller entities with impressive pipelines  Novartis   NYSE NVS   recently announced that it will acquire The Medicines Company   NASDAQ MDCO   and add a potentially transformational investigational cholesterol lowering therapy to its portfolio Roche is finally set to acquire Spark Therapeutics after a prolonged delay  while Japanese company Astellas Pharma is taking over gene therapy company Audentes Therapeutics  Inc and has already acquired privately held  development stage biotechnology company Xyphos Biosciences  Inc to boost its immuno oncology pipeline Meanwhile  new drug approvals and label expansions of blockbuster drugs boosted investor sentiment  Key approvals include Vyondys 53  Oxbryta  Givlaari  Reblozyl  Trikafta  Inrebic  Vyleesi and Evenity  among others Choosing a biotech stock for investment can be tricky as smaller biotechs carry a risk with their product pipelines

146247,367762,ALXN,All You Need To Know About Alexion  ALXN  Rating Upgrade To Strong Buy,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Alexion basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Alexion  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Alexion
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this drugmaker is expected to earn  10 35 per share  which is a change of 30 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Alexion  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

146300,367815,ALXN,Adopt Rising P E Technique With These 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"With key U S  equity indexes hovering around all time highs  investors  search for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is understandable 
The idea is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run explains investors  inclination toward low P E stocks 
But stocks with a rising P E can be equally worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price  So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said time frames  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few factors narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 54 
Here are five of 54 stocks that passed the screen 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ALXN    Alexion Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of life transforming drugs  for the treatment of patients with ultra rare disorders  It belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 23  of 250  industries  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

146303,367818,ALXN,3 Reasons Why Alexion  ALXN  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drugmaker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alexion is 17 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 30 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 12 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Alexion is 20 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 19 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Alexion have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Alexion has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Alexion well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-alexion-alxn-is-a-great-growth-stock-200493202,200493202

What Bargain Hunting  Tap These 5 Stocks with Rising P Es
Bargain hunting or looking for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is among the widely used investing strategies  Investors believe that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But there is more to this whole P E story as not only low P E  stocks with a rising P E can also fetch solid returns 
Rising P E  An Useful Tool
Generally  the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings  As forecasts for expected earnings move higher  demand for the stock should drive its price  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out for every dollar of earnings  Thus  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company s inherent strength 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains

146343,367858,ALXN,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Alexion  ALXN  Now,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drugmaker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alexion is 17 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 30 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 6  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Alexion has an S TA ratio of 0 33  which means that the company gets  0 33 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 21  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Alexion looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 18 7  this year versus the industry average of 5 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Alexion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alexion a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Alexion is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-alexion-alxn-now-200479413,200479413

What s Next for Alexion 
While Alexion has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

146378,367893,ALXN,Alexion  ALXN  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Alexion basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Alexion  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Alexion
This drugmaker is expected to earn  9 95 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 25 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Alexion  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

146379,367894,ALXN,3 Big Drug Biotech Stocks Set To Beat Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,The third quarter earnings season for the pharma sector begins next week with J J  NYSE JNJ  set to report earnings on Oct 15 The first half of the year was a mixed bag for big drug and biotech companies as far as earnings performance is concerned  While big names like Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Bristol Myers and Lilly performed relatively poorly  Amgen  AstraZeneca  AbbVie  NYSE ABBV   Sanofi  PA SASY  and Merck delivered decent earnings and sales growth  The focus now shifts to the second half of the year  It is to be seen if the ones who did not do well in the first half recover in the second half and the ones that did well continue to deliver solid earnings and sales performance Overall  relatively newer drugs have been driving the top line of most of the big shots backed by higher demand   a trend we expect to have benefited third quarter sales  However  mature products of some of these companies face an array of generic biosimilar as well as branded competition  which might have put pressure on sales and margins in the to be reported quarter  Meanwhile  greater pricing pressure in the United States and negative currency impacts are some other top line headwinds that the companies might have faced Here we have highlighted three bigshot drug biotech companies  which are expected to deliver positive earnings surprise in the upcoming quarterly earnings By means of the   we have zeroed in on three drug biotech stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive   These are valuable tools for investors looking for stocks with high potential to outpace estimates in the upcoming announcements  Moreover  stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP have 70  chance to deliver a positive surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Our PicksAmgen   NASDAQ AMGN  Amgen has an Earnings ESP of  2 31  and a Zacks Rank of 2  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings is pegged at  3 47 per share  The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 29 Amgen s performance has been impressive  with the company delivering a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with the average being 6 72  Higher sales of products like Prolia  Xgeva  Kyprolis and Blincyto should make up for lower sales of Amgen s mature drugs like Enbrel  Aranesp  Epogen  Neupogen  Neulasta and Sensipar  which are facing an array of branded and generic competitors  Though Repatha sales are gaining due to higher unit demand  it is being partially offset by lower prices Sales of Prolia  Xgeva  Blincyto  Parsabiv  Kyprolis and Nplate should continue to be driven by higher demand  Biosimilars could once again be an important contributor to top line growth Amgen s new migraine drug  Aimovig recorded sequentially improved sales in the second quarter driven by an increase in the percentage of paid volume with improvement in conversion of free to paid patients  We expect the positive trend to be reflected in third quarter results Alexion Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ ALXN  Alexion has an Earnings ESP of  8 14  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 23  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings is pegged at  2 49 per share  You can see  Alexion s earnings performance has been impressive  with the company delivering a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with the average being 13 34  Alexion s sales should continue to be driven by its blockbuster rare disease drug Soliris whose underlying growth has been robust for both approved indications    paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS    The label expansion of the drug for the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG  also boosted sales  We expect the positive trend to have contributed to its third quarter performance Alexion s other medicines like Strensiq and Kanuma should also contribute to the top line  Its new medicine  Ultomiris  was approved to treat PNH in the United States in December last year and is off to a strong start  recording sales of  78 8 million in the first half  Ultomiris should bring in higher sales in the third quarter as it was approved in Japan in June and in Europe in July Lilly   NYSE LLY  Lilly has an Earnings ESP of  1 22  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 23  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings is pegged at  1 43 per share Lilly s earnings performance has been mixed  Its earnings beat expectations in three of the last four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 0 69  The impact of pricing pressure in the United States due to rebates and legislated increases in Medicare Part D cost sharing  price cuts in some international markets and currency headwinds are expected to be reflected in third quarter 2019 results However  Like the previous few quarters  strong demand trends of new products namely Trulicity  Taltz  Jardiance  Basaglar  Olumiant and Verzenio as well as new migraine drug  Emgality should make up for the decline in sales of established products like Cialis due to loss of exclusivity and the impact of Lartruvo s impending product withdrawal  Lilly has suspended promotion of its advanced soft tissue sarcoma drug Lartruvo due to the failure of the ANNOUNCE confirmatory study Among the new drugs  in August  Taltz gained FDA approval for its third indication   active ankylosing spondylitis  which expanded the drug s eligible patient population and might have driven sales in the third quarter 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was

146382,367897,ALXN,Alexion Pharmaceuticals  ALXN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 24 billion  up 20 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 45  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alexion 
For Alexion  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 80  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Alexion will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Alexion would post earnings of  2 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 64  delivering a surprise of  11 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Alexion appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alexion-pharmaceuticals-alxn-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200474046,200474046

146396,367911,ALXN,Will  Virtual Biotechs  Make Drugs Cheaper ,news,"By   

SEATTLE    Ingrid Swanson Pultz s biotech company lacks most of the standard accoutrements  It doesn t have a lab or an office    or any employees  Pultz launched PVP Biologics while still working as a microbiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle  With half a million dollars in grants and donations  she hires the people she needs on a contractual basis or asks them to join one of the company s advisory boards 
Pultz s company is investigating a potential treatment for celiac disease  and while her approach may seem unconventional  a growing number of founders are embracing the  virtual startup  model as a way to save on the onerous upfront costs of creating a business from scratch 
This break from the standard industry playbook is particularly attractive to entreprenuers and investors at a time when the biotech industry faces greater public scrutiny  and presidential candidates threaten to reel in drug prices  While companies are under no obligation to pass on savings  and drug prices do not necessarily reflect the cost of drug development  virtual biotechs are better positioned to introduce their medicines at lower launch prices if they re so inclined 
 I think anything that can take a chunk of the cost out of the system is a step toward making drugs more affordable  and that s one of the main benefits of this model   says Bernard Munos  a biotech analyst and consultant at the InnoThink Center for Research in Biomedical Innovation 
It works like this  Most virtual biotechs own the rights to a potential treatment purchased from another company or developed at a university  Once the company has a drug candidate  one or two people can lead a virtual team of consultants and outsource the research to a company that conducts initial tests and develops the medicine to the point where it is ready to enter clinical trials 
Dr  Richard Stead has helped launch between 40 and 50 virtual biotechs over the past 13 years through his company  BioPharma Consulting Services  near Seattle  Despite his long professional history with brick and mortar operations    he was the first physician employed by Amgen  O AMGN  in 1988 and later worked for Immunex    he now professes a particular fondness for virtual companies 
 I don t think the virtual team is for every company or for every function within a company  but I think it can be more capital efficient and I think you can get  on average  a higher quality of person and experience in that way   he says   I think there s a real place for it  
Stead is currently advising Pultz on PVP Biologics  So far  she has hired a toxicologist to help plan animal studies  a consultant who specializes in manufacturing and Stead  who designs clinical trials  She calls them from her home office each week  When they do meet in person  it s in a nondescript conference room in the Life Sciences Building 

In the early days of biotech  companies spent millions to build elaborate headquarters with labs and office suites long before any of their products were ever approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  Biotech leaders thought companies needed to be fully integrated and able to handle all aspects of researching  developing  commercializing and marketing a potential drug from Day One 
But many of these companies failed to ever produce an FDA approved treatment  Those that did were often bought by pharmaceutical companies  which unceremoniously disposed of their headquarters anyway  It wasn t long before this model began to seem inefficient 
 That s not how companies are started these days   Chris Rivera  president of the Washington Biotechnology and Biomedical Association  says    I think going from ground zero to building infrastructure from Day One is probably kind of a bygone era that we probably won t see going forward  

Over the past decade  more biotechs have forgone the luxuries of lab space and full time employees to operate virtually during the early stages of research  Now many investors even prefer it  Patrick Heron  who oversees life sciences for Seattle based investment group Frazier Healthcare Partners  says between 30 and 50 percent of the companies that he funds begin as virtual companies  He estimates that 15 years ago  only 10 percent of companies were virtual 
In September  biotech stocks temporarily dropped following widespread public criticism of Turing Pharmaceutical s sudden price hike on a prescription medicine and vows by several Democratic presidential candidates to fight skyrocketing drug costs  If that pressure continues  Heron says the industry can expect to see more virtual companies launched on lean budgets 
 If the market continues on its current trend  I think you re going to see more virtual companies and more use of outside resources   he says 
Munos tends to agree   If there is a backlash and the prices are ratcheted down  companies that operate on a virtual model will be able to withstand the shock much better than others   he says 
Already  there are plenty of success stories about companies that went the virtual route  Take  for example  Zafgen  Its founders used a virtual model to take a drug to treat obesity all the way through midstage clinical trials for about  68 million  a sum that Munos says is about one fifth of what a major pharmaceutical company might spend  In June of 2014  it earned  96 million in an initial public offering  This year  Alexion Pharmaceuticals  O ALXN  acquired a virtual company called Synageva BioPharma  which makes rare disease treatments  for  8 4 billion 

Seattle is well positioned for this model to take hold  The state is a hive of activity    120 new life sciences companies have been launched in Washington this year  bringing the total number of new ventures to over 400 since 2009   It s been a frenzy  maybe is the right word   Rivera says 
But at the same time  the city suffers from a lack of available lab space and a dearth of talent  Together  these factors convince many founders and CEOs that a virtual model is the right fit 
 More and more companies are becoming virtual   Rivera says   I think most of the startups are starting in that form and fashion now just because it s so darn expensive to put a brick and mortar together or find lab space  

Pultz says her model is a great fit for investors who are more skittish about making a substantial contribution for a large infrastructure project before a drug is even proved   It s a way to compensate for the fact that a lot of groups in biotech are more risk averse than they used to be   she says 
In the crowded university office and lab space she shares with other early career researchers and graduate students  Pultz is putting the finishing touches on an enzyme called KumaMax that breaks down fragments of gluten that naturally pass through healthy individuals but are known to cause inflammation in the intestines of those with celiac disease 
She says KumaMax breaks down gluten fragments  orders of magnitude better  than enzymes already in clinical trials  Her company  called PVP Biologics  a sly reference to  player versus player   a phase popular with gamers  has no venture capital    yet  But when she spins out PVP Biologics from the university in the coming year  KumaMax will be nearly ready to enter trials 
Traditional companies might have had to raise millions in venture capital to engineer an enzyme to such an advanced stage  So far  Pultz has paid for consultants through a  250 000 grant from Washington state s Life Sciences Discovery Fund  which was matched by  250 000 in contributions from private donors  Her salary is paid by the Institute for Protein Design at the university  Heron estimates companies can save between 20 and 30 percent of their costs by starting out virtually as compared with launching as a traditional company 
Pultz hopes to have KumaMax in clinical trials by 2017  She estimates that the company will need between  20 million to  30 million in venture capital to complete the remaining preclinical work and usher the enzyme through the first two phases of testing  Consultants tell her the cost may balloon to as much as  225 million for the third and final stage 
That sounds like a lot of money  But as she watches other companies raise millions of dollars on the promise of a molecule that has yet to be built in a lab   it gives me hope that we ll be able to raise our funding   she says

146404,367919,ALXN,Will Alexion  ALXN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry 
This drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10 50  
For the most recent quarter  Alexion was expected to post earnings of  2 36 per share  but it reported  2 64 per share instead  representing a surprise of 11 86   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 19 per share  while it actually produced  2 39 per share  a surprise of 9 13  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Alexion  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Alexion has an Earnings ESP of  8 14  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-alexion-alxn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200469971,200469971

146425,367940,ALXN,ALXN Or CBM  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Biomedical and Genetics sector have probably already heard of Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  and Cambrex  CBM   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Cambrex has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that ALXN has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
ALXN currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 91  while CBM has a forward P E of 29 13  We also note that ALXN has a PEG ratio of 0 93  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CBM currently has a PEG ratio of 2 91 
Another notable valuation metric for ALXN is its P B ratio of 2 39  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CBM has a P B of 2 97 
Based on these metrics and many more  ALXN holds a Value grade of B  while CBM has a Value grade of C 
ALXN sticks out from CBM in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that ALXN is the better option right now ",2019-09-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alxn-or-cbm-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200464495,200464495
146445,367960,ALXN,Alexion  ALXN  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drugmaker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alexion is 14 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 25  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Alexion is 20 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 18 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Alexion have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alexion a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

146496,368011,ALXN,Is A Beat In The Cards For Celgene s  CELG  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Celgene Corporation   NASDAQ CELG   is expected to have significantly benefited from key drug Revlimid s performance  which is expected to reflect in the upcoming quarterly results 
The company surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters  In the last reported quarter  it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2 41  Celgene Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

    
Let s see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model indicates that Celgene is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  
Earnings ESP  The company s Earnings ESP is  6 28   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Celgene has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which when combined with a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat  
Note that we caution against the stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors at Play
For 2019  Celgene expects revenues to be  17 0  17 2 billion  Revlimid sales are projected to be  10 8 billion and Abraxane sales  1 1 billion  Pomalyst s revenues are expected to be  2 4 billion  whereas Otezla sales are projected to be  1 9 billion 
Celgene s key product  Revlimid  is likely to be the main growth driver in the second quarter  Revlimid  an oral  immunomodulatory drug  is currently approved for several indications  including the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma   MM    myelodysplastic syndromes   MDS   and mantle cell lymphoma   MCL   
Share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug s growth  Continued uptake in front line  non stem  cell eligible and post stem cell transplant maintenance segments should further propel sales of the drug in the second quarter 
Meanwhile  in May 2019  the European Commission  EC  approved Revlimid in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone  RVd  for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma  who are not eligible for transplant  Also  the FDA approved the drug  lenalidomide  in combination with a rituximab product for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma  FL  or marginal zone lymphoma  MZL   The label expansion of the drug will further boost sales in the second quarter 
Apart from Revlimid  Pomalyst  Otezla and Abraxane are expected to contribute to the top line  Psoriasis drug  Otezla  missed the consensus mark in the first quarter but we expect it to perform impressively in the second quarter 
Apart from the regular top and bottom line numbers  investors will also focus on pipeline updates from the company  The FDA has accepted for review the new drug application  NDA  for ozanimod to treat patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis  RMS  in the United States  The European Medicines Agency  EMA  also accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application for ozanimod for the treatment of adults with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in the European Union 
The FDA also accepted its Biologics License Application  BLA  for investigational erythroid maturation agent  luspatercept  The candidate is being developed in collaboration with Acceleron Pharma Inc  Luspatercept is being developed for the treatment of adult patients with very low to intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS  associated anemia  who have ring sideroblasts and require red blood cell  RBC  transfusions  and those with beta thalassemia associated anemia  who require RBC transfusions  The FDA has granted Priority Review to the BLA for the treatment of beta thalassemia 
Key Anticipated Updates
Celgene has been in news since the beginning of 2019  owing to the announcement of a merger agreement with large cap pharma company  Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY    The transaction was earlier anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2019 but might be delayed now  given certain regulatory conditions  We expect an update on the same during the earnings call 
Share Price Performance
Celgene s stock has gained 39 5  in the year so far   while the performance of the  remained flat 

 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

146506,368021,ALXN,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Alexion  ALXN  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drugmaker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alexion is 14 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 25  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Alexion is 20 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 18 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Alexion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line

146525,368040,ALXN,Alexion  ALXN  Moves To Strong Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Alexion is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Alexion imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Alexion
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this drugmaker is expected to earn  9 50 per share  which is a change of 20  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Alexion  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

146529,368044,ALXN,Why Alexion  ALXN  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 13 04   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Alexion came out with earnings of  2 39 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 19 per share  representing a surprise of 9 13   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 83 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 14 per share  delivering a surprise of 16 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Alexion  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Alexion currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 24  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-alexion-alxn-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200441581,200441581

FDA  in June  approved Soliris to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder  NMOSD   based on positive data from the phase III study  PREVENT  The drug is under review for the same in Europe and

Sales are expected to be higher in the second quarter  Meanwhile  Ultomiris was approved in Japan in June and in the EU earlier this month  However  these will not contribute to sales in the second quarter Under its metabolic franchise  the company markets Strensiq for the treatment of patients with pediatric onset hypophosphatasia  HPP  and Kanuma for the treatment of patients with lysosomal

146561,368076,ALXN,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Alexion  ALXN ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this drugmaker a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alexion is 12 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 6  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Alexion is 20 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 17 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Alexion have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Alexion has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drugmaker is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alexion is 12 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 19 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 7  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Alexion is 20 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 17 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26 9  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Alexion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1  over the past month

146592,368107,ALXN,What Makes Alexion  ALXN  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Alexion is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Alexion  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Alexion
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this drugmaker is expected to earn  9 49 per share  which is a change of 19 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Alexion  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

146593,368108,ALXN,ALXN Or ALKS  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Biomedical and Genetics stocks have likely encountered both Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  and Alkermes  ALKS   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  Alexion Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Alkermes has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ALXN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ALKS has recently  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
ALXN currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 53  while ALKS has a forward P E of 74 48  We also note that ALXN has a PEG ratio of 0 92  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  ALKS currently has a PEG ratio of 3 22 
Another notable valuation metric for ALXN is its P B ratio of 2 97  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  ALKS has a P B of 3 62 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ALXN s Value grade of B and ALKS s Value grade of D

146609,368124,ALXN,Ra Pharmaceuticals Closes End of Phase 2 Interaction With FDA,opinion,"Ra Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ RARX   announced that it has successfully completed the End of Phase II interactions with the FDA for its phase III study on zilucoplan for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG  
Based on FDA s feedback  Ra Pharma plans to initiate a pivotal  phase III study to evaluate the efficacy of a once daily  subcutaneously  SC  self administered dose of 0 3 mg kg of zilucoplan versus placebo  The study is expected to enroll about 130 patients with gMG  who are acetylcholine receptor  AChR  antibody positive  regardless of their prior therapies  The primary endpoint will be the change in the MG Activities of Daily Living  MG ADL  score from baseline to week 12  
Once the phase III study is complete  patients will have the option to enroll themselves in an open label  long term extension study  Ra Pharma expects to initiate the phase III study in the second half of 2019 
The End of Phase II interactions were conducted after the company completed the phase II study on zilucoplan for the treatment of gMG  Statistically significant improvements in the pre specified primary and key secondary endpoints were observed for both zilucoplan dose groups versus placebo at 12 weeks 
Shares of the company have increased 30 9  in the past year compared with the  s growth of 10  

 
After having reached an alignment with the FDA based on the phase III study  Ra Pharma has decided to prioritize gMG as the lead indication for zilucoplan  with aim to build a complement focused neurology franchise  The company thus plans to initiate a phase II study in an undisclosed neuromuscular indication in the second half of 2019 
As a result  the company has decided to postpone further clinical development of zilucoplan in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH   Dosing will continue in the company s long term extension of the phase II PNH program

146610,368125,ALXN,Alexion Pharmaceuticals  ALXN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  30 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 11 billion  up 19  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alexion 
For Alexion  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alexion will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Alexion would post earnings of  1 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 14  delivering a surprise of  16 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Alexion doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alexion-pharmaceuticals-alxn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200408475,200408475
146611,368126,ALXN,Can Alexion  ALXN  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Biomedical and Genetics industry 
This drugmaker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 16 18  
For the last reported quarter  Alexion came out with earnings of  2 14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 83 per share  representing a surprise of 16 94   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 75 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 02 per share  delivering a surprise of 15 43  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Alexion  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Alexion currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 17   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

146631,368146,ALXN,Alexion  ALXN  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals Ltd    NASDAQ ALXN   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 results  before the market opens  on Feb 4 
Alexion s shares have increased 1 7  in the past year  against the  s decline of 21 3  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors in Play
Alexion s complement franchise consists of key growth driver  Soliris  approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS  
Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS with Soliris across its 50 country operating platform  The underlying growth of Soliris has been robust  We expect Soliris to drive sales in the fourth quarter 
In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug  Alexion is working on expanding Soliris  label into additional indications  The FDA had also approved the drug for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti acetylcholine receptor antibody positive  The drug was approved in Europe as well for this indication  Label expansion should further boost sales for the drug 
Under its metabolic franchise  the company markets Strensiq for the treatment of patients with pediatric onset hypophosphatasia  HPP  and Kanuma for the treatment of patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency  LAL D   These drugs are expected to drive revenues in the fourth quarter 
Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug  Soliris  In May 2018  Alexion acquired Sweden based biopharmaceutical company  Wilson Therapeutics AB  The acquisition added a late stage candidate  WTX101 to the company s pipeline  The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease  a rare genetic disorder 
Alexion s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive  Recently  the company announced that the phase III study of its long acting C5 complement inhibitor Ultomiris  ravulizumab cwvz ALXN1210   conducted in complement inhibitor naive patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS   met its primary objective of complete thrombotic microangiopathy  TMA  response  The company plans to file regulatory submission in the United States in the first half of 2019  followed by similar applications in the European Union and Japan 
Last month  the FDA approved Ultomiris for the treatment of adult patients with PNH  well ahead of its action date of Feb 18  2019  Ultomiris is the first and the only long acting C5 complement inhibitor to get an approval for this indication 
Alexion is also conducting a phase I study of subcutaneous ALXN1210  co administered with Halozyme Therapeutics  Inc  s   NASDAQ HALO   ENHANZE drug delivery technology  PH20  Pending the co formulation data  this next generation subcutaneous formulation will be called ALXN1810 and has potential to further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once a month 
We expect updates on the candidate in fourth quarter earnings call

146674,368190,ALXN,Amgen s BiTE Immunotherapies Show Promise In Early Studies,opinion,"Amgen Inc    NASDAQ AMGN   announced first clinical data from the early stage studies on its two investigational novel bispecific T cell engager  BiTE  immunotherapies   AMG 420 and AMG 330 
Two separate phase I studies evaluated AMG 420  which targets B cell maturation antigen  BCMA  and AMG 330  which targets CD33 in heavily pre treated patients with multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia  AML  
Data from the studies showed that both AMG 420 and AMG 330 demonstrated anti tumor activity and early evidence of tolerability in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed or refractory AML  respectively 
The phase I study evaluating AMG 420  showed that seven out of 10 patients who were administered with 400  g d dose of AMG420 experienced complete response  while four patients showed no detectable cancer  Six patients were still responding at 7 5 months of follow up 
The findings were presented at the annual meeting of American Society of Hematology  ASH  
Notably  the FDA granted a fast track designation to AMG 420 based on this positive result from the early stage dose escalation study  The FDA grants a fast track designation to expedite development and the review process of a candidate  which is being developed to treat serious and unmet medical conditions 
Shares of Amgen have rallied 16 7  so far this year versus the  decline of 15 3  

 
The positive data seen in these early stage studies on the investigational BiTE immunotherapies is encouraging  especially when considered in the context of heavily pre treated patients  who have exhausted all available treatment options 
Amgen is developing approximately a dozen novel molecules leveraging its BiTE platform across hematologic and solid tumor targets  Its only marketed BiTE immunotherapy  Blincyto  gained an earlier than expected FDA approval in December 2014 and has now become a key top line driver for Amgen 
The drug recorded worldwide sales of  167 million during the first nine months of 2018 an increase of 29 5  year over year 
Blincyto has the potential to be developed for other hematologic malignancies

earnings release on Thursday In fact  so far this year  Puma Biotech stock has plummeted 79 7  compared with the  decline of 16 5  Puma Biotech incurred a loss of 37 cents per share for the third quarter of 2018  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  1 07 and the year ago loss of  2 07 Total revenues consist of net product revenues from the sales of Nerlynx as well as the company s license revenues  In the third quarter of 2018  total revenues were  62 6 million  of which   52 6 million were net product revenues and  10 million were license revenues  Moreover  sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  55 million in the reported quarter and the year ago figure of  6 million Product revenues comprised sales of Puma Biotech s only marketed product Nerlynx  However  Nerlynx sales were up a mere 3 5  on a sequential basis  which hurt investor sentiments and led to the stock price decline  The softer Nerlynx sales were due to increased patient discontinuations in the last reported quarter On third quarter conference call  the company stated that the percentage of patients  who discontinued Nerlynx due to adverse events  has increased since the second quarter and is now approximately 18  since the product s launch Nerlynx was launched in July 2017 in the United States for an extended adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early stage breast cancer in patients  previously treated with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Herceptin based adjuvant therapy  In September 2018  the European Commission gave a marketing approval to Nerlynx for the same indication Puma Biotech plans to commercialize Nerlynx in Europe during 2019  starting with a launch in Germany during the first half of 2019 followed by other European countries in the second half of 2019 During the third quarter  the new drug submission for Nerlynx was accepted in Canada for the given indication  Additionally  Puma Biotech s licensing partner CANbridge Pharmaceutical filed a new drug application  NDA  for Nerlynx to the National Medical Products Administration  NMPA  in China  The drug received a confirmation from the regulatory agency in China for the same disease Puma Biotech expects to submit regulatory applications for Nerlynx in additional countries later this year as well as in the first half of 2019 During the reported quarter s conference call  the company mentioned that as of Oct 31  there are 2 139 active patients on Nerlynx  of which  an estimated 87  received the drug through specialty pharmacies  The company expects Nerlynx sales to be in the range of  175  200 million for fiscal year 2018 Total operating costs  including SBC  in the third quarter were  73 9 million  down almost 11 5  year over year Research and development  R D  expenses were  36 4 million  down 26 5  from the year ago period owing to lower clinical study costs and stock based compensation expenses  Puma Biotech expects its R D costs to decrease in subsequent quarters as clinical studies wind down Selling  general and administrative expenses reduced 12 3  year over year to  28 5 million Other UpdatesSeveral additional studies on Nerlynx targeting different types of breast cancer patient populations and in earlier line settings are under way  Also  multiple phase II combination programs evaluating Nerlynx for the treatment of breast cancer are on  Significantly  Puma Biotech hopes to present data from the phase III NALA analysis  assessing Nerlynx for addressing third line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients during the fourth quarter of 2018 or the first half of 2019 In July 2018  Puma Biotech signed a collaborative agreement with privately held Strata Oncology  Inc to drive patient enrollment in the phase II SUMMIT study on Nerlynx  As of October  the study enrolled approximately 250 patients  The company plans to report additional data from the study by this year end or the first half of 2019 Puma Biotech is also conducting another phase II CONTROL study for using antidiarrheal prophylaxis on neratinib associated diarrhea regarding patients with HER2 positive early stage breast cancer  The company plans to report additional data from this study during the fourth quarter of 2018 Apart from the HER2 positive breast cancer indication  the company believes that neratinib holds great potential for treating multiple cancers including NSCLC and other tumor types  which over express or have a mutation in HER2  The label expansion of the drug will allow it to treat and access an expanded patient population Puma Biotechnology  Inc  Price

Up Next  Bonus Idea
The Best
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which as we close the books on the 2nd Quarter and prepare for a holiday shortened 4th of July week  sees that the equity markets look to have run out of gas  Maybe the short week will re energize them  All the indexes had a positive quarter with the IWM just out pacing the QQQ  7 9  to 6 5  and the SPY gaining 3 1   The QQQ won the month up 0 9  to the 0 6  for the IWM and the SPY eked out a 0 1  gain  The monthly candles all look toppy with long upper shadows  while the quarterly candles are all looking strong 
Elsewhere Gold looks as it may pause in its downtrend while Crude Oil continues to race higher  The US Dollar Index is pausing in its uptrend while US Treasuries are on the edge of a break out to the upside  The Shanghai Composite may be ready to pause in its downtrend while Emerging Markets are setting up for a possible reversal higher  Volatility looks to remain low but above recent levels keeping the wind at the backs of the equity markets but the breeze blowing softer 
The equity index ETFs SPY  IWM and QQQ  all had a mixed week with early signs of strength Friday fading into the close  leaving questions about the short term  The longer weekly timeframe was much less troublesome showing consolidation for the SPY continuing and the IWM and QQQ digesting recent moves higher  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

146765,368281,ALXN,Alexion  ALXN  Gains On Positive Date From Lead Candidate ,opinion,Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   gained 3 38  after the company reported positive data on candidate  ALXN1210 from a pivotal phase III study Alexion s shares have declined 11 7  in the last six months  worse than the loss of 8 8   This phase III randomized  open label  active controlled  multinational  and multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ALXN1210 compared to Alexion s lead drug Soliris administered by intravenous  IV  infusion to adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  who are na ve to complement inhibitor treatment The study was designed to evaluate the non inferiority of ALXN1210 compared to Soliris  ALXN1210 demonstrated non inferiority to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment na ve patients with PNH based on the co primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of lactate dehydrogenase   LDH   levels In addition  the study also demonstrated non inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints   percentage change from baseline in LDH levels  change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy   FACIT     Fatigue scale  proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis  and proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels ALXN1210 was well tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with that seen for Soliris  The candidate was then evaluated for superiority testing as non inferiority was achieved across both co primary and all four key secondary endpoints  While ALXN1210 did not achieve superiority  a numeric trend in favor of ALXN1210 was observed for breakthrough hemolysis for Soliris with a p value of 0 074  The data also showed that ALXN1210 provides immediate and complete inhibition of the complement C5 protein that is sustained over the entire 8 week dosing interval The positive results should support ALXN1210 as the new standard of care for patients with PNH  Alexion plans to submit ALXN1210 in PNH in the United States  EU  and Japan in the second half of 2018 In addition to PNH  ALXN1210 is also being evaluated for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS   and anti acetylcholine receptor  AchR  antibody positive myasthenia gravis  MG    ALXN210 is also being evaluated in a phase III study in complement inhibitor na ve patients with aHUS  administered intravenously every eight weeks The company also plans to initiate a single  pharmacokinetics based phase III study of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously once per week as a potential treatment for patients with PNH and aHUS  Alexion also plans to initiate the development of ALXN1210 as a potential treatment for patients with generalized MG  gMG  and patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy  IgAN  The candidate has also received Orphan Drug Designation  for the treatment of patients with PNH in the United States and EU  and for the subcutaneous treatment of patients with aHUS in the United States Alexion s blockbuster drug  Soliris  continues to perform well and the FDA approval of the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis will further boost sales  However  the company relies heavily on Soliris for growth and sales of Soliris will be impacted by ramp of ALXN1210 trials The successful development and commercialization of ALXN1210 will reduce the company s dependence on Soliris and extend the patent of the PNH franchise as well Zacks Rank   Key picksAlexion currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A few better ranked

Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris  The deal will strengthen Alexion s rare disease pipeline with a late stage candidate However  investors weren t much impressed with the news as the acquisition adds a candidate to the pipeline and not an approved drug  Thus  the stock lost 2 35  following the announcement  Moreover  the market opportunity for such a rare disease will be limited and might not boost the top line as expected   Alexion s shares have lost 21 7  in the last six months  compared with the  decline of 16 2  Of late  quite a few biotech companies have been looking to strengthen their portfolio pipeline  While 2017 was pretty ho hum on this front with just a few key deals  2018 is expected to see a surge in M A primarily due to lower U S  tax rates   Taking a clue from Gilead Sciences   NASDAQ GILD   acquisition of Kite Pharma  Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR T space   Sanofi   NYSE SNY   acquired Bioverativ Inc  which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders

before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4 76  This generic drug maker s shares have lost 40 1  in the past year  while the  witnessed a decrease of 27 7  Teva s earnings have surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters  met the same in one and missed expectations in the remaining two  resulting in an average negative surprise of 2 66  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderIncreased pricing erosion and volume declines in Teva s U S  Generics unit  ongoing political turmoil in Venezuela and loss of exclusivity in the Specialty segment are hurting the company s top line  We do not expect any improving trend in the fourth quarter The U S  generics industry is witnessing significant competitive and pricing pressure  thereby affecting the company s top line performance  An increase in FDA generic drug approvals and ongoing customer consolidation are resulting in additional competitive pressure in the industry  Drug price erosion was 10  in the third quarter and management had warned on the call that the erosion will accelerate in the fourth quarter and beyond  Moreover  accelerated FDA approvals of additional generic versions of competing off patent medicines  lower than expected contribution of new generic launches and increased competition for its largest product   Concerta authorized generic   will also continue to hurt sales in the Generics unit Meanwhile  in the Specialty segment  loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone  Azilect and Nuvigil will hurt sales Sales of Teva s blockbuster multiple sclerosis  MS  treatment Copaxone should continue to erode due to generic competition  Glatopa  a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg  has been on the market since June 2015  In October  in a major blow to Teva  Mylan   NASDAQ MYL   launched  at risk  its generic version of the 40 mg formulation  much earlier than expected  Mylan also launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October  With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation  Copaxone sales are expected to erode rapidly  Teva had previously estimated a negative impact of at least 30 cents per share on fourth quarter earnings Meanwhile  a generic version of Azilect was launched in the United States in January 2017 and sales have started to decline sharply  ProAir also lost exclusivity in the United States in 2017 and its fourth quarter sales are likely to be lower To combat the rapid decline in sales  last month  Teva announced a restructuring plan that will see more than 25  of the company s global workforce being laid off over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018  Though management then provided quite a few details on how the plan will be executed  we expect an update on the upcoming conference call  Also  in November  Teva had announced a new organizational and leadership structure to save costs and increase productivity that included the departure of heads of three divisions  The company had also said then that it will no longer have two separate global groups for its two businesses   generics and specialty medicines  Instead  Teva will now operate through three regions  North America  Europe and Growth Markets   which will include generics  specialty  and over the counter  OTC  medicines  An update on the progress made on the new strategy so far is expected on the call Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Its Earnings ESP is  3 10  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 78 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 81 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Teva has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other drug biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   with an Earnings ESP of  8 92  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 8 Puma Biotechnology  Inc    NASDAQ PBYI    with an Earnings ESP of  2 02  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release results later this month  You can see  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks

We remind investors that J J had terminated the global license and collaboration agreement with Achillion for developing hepatitis C treatments earlier in September  The decision was taken by J J as part of its strategy to focus on areas of greatest unmet medical need

The phase II study is evaluating the candidate in two separate groups in patients with C3G or IC MPGN  Group 1 evaluated a dose of 100 mg of ACH 4471 thrice daily for 14 days in two patients  Along with proteinuria  the study also measured the ratio of C3 fragments to intact C3 in plasma  which also decreased rapidly compared to baseline during the course of the study  Higher C3 fragments are believed to be responsible for kidney damage and loss of function seen in this disease over time 
Presently  no FDA approved therapies are available to treat C3G  However  the promise shown by the candidate is a boost for the company as it indicates a potential treatment under development 
Achillion is currently selecting patients for enrollment in group 2 of the study 
Moreover  the company has plans to initiate two separate phase II studies on ACH 4471 to evaluate it in C3G   IC MPGN patients over six and twelve months during the first half of 2018

146859,368375,ALXN,Werner Enterprises  Cott  Akari Therapeutics  And Alexion Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 22  2017    Werner Enterprises  Nasdaq    NASDAQ WERN      as the Bull of the Day  Cott Corporation  NYSE    NYSE COT      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Akari Therapeutics  Nasdaq    NASDAQ AKTX      and Alexion Nasdaq    NASDAQ ALXN      Here is a synopsis of all four stocks   Werner Enterprises Nasdaq      is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports a clean slate of A s for the Zacks Style Scores  With all that going for it  you should not be surprised that I picked it as the Bull of the Day DescriptionWerner Enterprises is a transportation company primarily engaged in hauling truckload shipments of general commodities in both interstate and intrastate commerce  The Company operates throughout the 48 contiguous states pursuant to operating authority  both common and contract  granted by the Department of Transportation and pursuant to intrastate authority granted by various states  They also have authority to operate in the ten provinces of Canada and have through trailer service in and out of Mexico Earnings HistoryWERN has a good earnings history  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WERN has been moving higher over the last three months  The 2017 number has moved from  1 13 to  1 24 over the last 90 days while the 2018 number has increased from  1 40 to  1 50 over the same time period   Cott Corporation NYSE      is the Bear of the Day today because it is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell    It became a Strong Sell because earnings estimates were falling and we will go over that later  but I also want to point out the oppressive tax that residents of Chicago face when they are buying a sweetened beverage Can you believe a city government pretends to care about your health in a way to make you pay for sweetened beverages at a rate of one cent per ounce   That is 12 cents on a regular can of soda or  1 44 in taxes on a twelve pack   Maybe the former  Top Cop  will repeal this tax when he runs for  and becomes  Mayor    GarryForMayor Not all of the problems that COT has seen come from Chicago taxes pushing potential consumers to other beverages to avoid an oppressive tax  Let s take a look at the reason why this stock is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  DescriptionCott Corporation is one of the world s largest non alcoholic beverage companies and the world s largest retailer brand soft drink provider  The Company commercializes its business in over Sixty countries worldwide  with its principal markets being the United States  Canada  the United Kingdom and Mexico  Cott markets or supplies over two hundred retailer and licensed brands  and Company owned brands including Cott  RC  Vintage  Vess and So Clear  Its products include carbonated soft drinks  sparkling and flavored waters  energy drinks  sports drinks  juices  juice drinks and smoothies  ready to drink teas  and other non carbonated beverages Earnings HistoryThere are two recent misses of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The most recent miss was a negative 62  earnings surprise   The previous miss was a 42  negative earnings surprise Earnings EstimatesThe reason most stocks fall to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is that earnings estimates are falling   This table can be found on the Zacks website under the detailed estimates page Additional content Why Akari Therapeutics  AKTX  Skyrocketed on ThursdayOn Thursday  shares of biopharmaceutical company Akari Therapeutics  Nasdaq      skyrocketed  up over 60  by midday trading the stock was up 90  in premarket trading after it announced it would advance its lead drug candidate In a   Akari said that after an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and based on the agency s feedback  the company would be pushing forward Coversin into Phase 3 development for the treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria  PNH  in the first quarter of 2018 In the U S   the PNH indication has  Fast Track  status  PNH is a rare  life threatening disease of the blood  it s characterized by the destruction of red blood cells  blood clots and impaired bone marrow function  PNH affects about 1 to 1 5 persons per million  and primarily impacts younger adults  according to Johns Hopkins  Following our recent FDA meeting  we are working to initiate a Phase III clinical trial of Coversin in PNH in Q1 2018   said Dr  David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Akari Therapeutics   We will continue to work closely with the FDA  benefitting from our Fast Track status in the U S   and with the EMA towards submission of a BLA and MAA  respectively  for Coversin in PNH  Akari said that it plans to perform two Phase 3 clinical studies  CAPSTONE and ASSET  CAPSTONE will carry out on  na ve  PNH patients where Alexion s  Nasdaq      Soliris  or eculizumab  is not the standard of care  while ASSET is a Phase 3 clinical study that switches PNH patients from eculizumab to treatment with Coversin With Coversin delivered subcutaneously  patients may have greater independence due to self administration  Phase II studies are also planned for a number of other indications where Coversin s actions on both the complement and leukotriene  LTB4  pathways play a role  Its two leading targets in this area are atopic keratoconjunctivitis  AKC   a rare eye disorder and severe bullous pemphigoid  BP  LON BP    a rare skin disorder   added Solomon Akari focuses on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics to treat orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  The stock is a  1

147017,368533,ALXN,Regeneron Vs  Alexion  Which Stock Is A Better Pick Post Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Second quarter earnings season is almost over for the Medical sector with 94 5  of companies belonging to this segment having reported results  A look at the scorecard for Q2 shows that the Medical sector recorded earnings growth of 6 7  on revenue growth of 4 3   While the earnings beat ratio was 82 7   the revenue beat ratio was 67 3   Biotech stocks  in particular  did pretty well this quarter with quite a few companies raising their guidance for the year  Pharmaceutical companies also fared reasonably well  Generic companies  on the other hand  had a tough quarter  and are facing a bleak outlook for the remainder of the year While several major biotech stocks did well in the second quarter  here is look at how two major names in this sector   Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN     fared in the second quarter and which one looks better positioned for the second half of the year An In Depth Look at 2Q17 Results  Both Regeneron and Alexion surpassed earnings as well as revenue expectations in the second quarter  Regeneron s earnings results were driven by strong Eylea sales as well as a lower tax rate  Flagship drug  Eylea  continued to perform well though PCSK9 inhibitor  Praluent  continues to lag  The company is in discussions with payers with respect to improvement in utilization management criteria  Meanwhile  CVS announced that it would provide co preferred access to Praluent through its CVS Caremark commercial formularies  which cover approximately 25 million lives  Also read     Focus was also on new product launches   Dupixent  eczema  and Kevzara  rheumatoid arthritis    Alexion s results were driven by the performance of flagship drug  Soliris  and continued momentum of Strensiq  The company  however  noted that revenues benefited by  35 million reflecting the favorable timing of orders  Also read    2017 Outlook  Regeneron raised its U S  sales growth outlook for Eylea to approximately 10   old guidance  single digit percentage   The company also lowered its expected tax rate for the year Alexion also raised its outlook for the year  The company expects earnings of  5 40    5 55 per share on revenues of  3 450    3 525 million  old guidance   5 10    5 30 per share on revenues of  3 400    3 500 million  Pipeline Catalysts  For any pharmaceutical or biotech company  the pipeline is of utmost importance and plays an important role in investment decisions  So  it always makes sense to take a look at a company s pipeline and upcoming catalysts Regeneron  which has 17 candidates in its pipeline  has an eventful second half of the year coming up with key mid to late stage pipeline catalysts lined up  Top line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma are due later this quarter   positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U S  filing in the fourth quarter  Dupixent should also gain EU approval for the eczema indication in the third quarter  Regeneron is evaluating Dupixent in the pediatric atopic dermatitis setting with a phase III study in children 12 to 17 years of age currently enrolling while two additional studies in younger atopic dermatitis patients  the first in children between the ages of 6 and 11  and the second in children between the ages of six months and five years  expected to commence in the second half of the year Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company s PD 1 antibody REGN2810  for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  CSCC   the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma  Positive data would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the first quarter of 2018  REGB2810 is being evaluated for additional indications as well Meanwhile  Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab  Top line data from two phase II studies   one in wet age related macular degeneration and another in diabetic macular edema   are expected in the fourth quarter of the year Regeneron also expects to report top line data in the second half of the year from a late stage program on REGN2222  which is being evaluated for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus Meanwhile  Alexion is redefining its R D strategy with a focus on its key expertise areas  The company will continue to grow its rare diseases business which includes growing Soliris  Strensiq and Kanuma  To increase productivity  Alexion will focus its internal research efforts on its complement expertise and its development efforts on its core therapeutic areas of hematology  nephrology  neurology and metabolic disorders  The company has also decided to de prioritize certain pipeline candidates and is discontinuing its preclinical programs with mRNA therapies as well as other preclinical programs that do not fall within the complement franchise Alexion has a key regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to give a decision by Oct 23 regarding the label expansion of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG   A decision in the EU should also come out in the third quarter  Moreover  enrolment for a phase III study on Soliris for relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder  NMOSD  is expected to finish this year Estimate Revisions  Both companies have been witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates for 2017  While Regeneron has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 31 3  upward over the last 30 days  Alexion has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 4 8  upward during this period Price and Valuation Perspective  A look at Regeneron s year to date  YTD  price performance shows that its shares have gained 27 1  year to date  significantly outperforming the  6 2  rally 

Alexion has also performed better than the industry with shares gaining 8 7   YTD 
Going by the current price to earnings multiple  which is often used to value profitable biotech stocks  Regeneron is trading at a P E multiple of 41 4  well above the S P 500 P E multiple of 17 8  Alexion looks slightly cheaper given its P E multiple of 25 7 Bottom LineAt present  Regeneron looks like the better pick to us  Eylea continues to show strength and we are encouraged by the company s progress with its pipeline  Regeneron has a deep and promising pipeline and has some important pipeline events this year which could act as positive catalysts As far as Alexion is concerned  we are impressed by the new management s efforts to turn things around  Alexion had a rough 2016 with the company facing several challenges including a probe into improper sales practices  the departure of key executives and pipeline setbacks  We are encouraged by the company s decision to re prioritize its efforts toward core areas  However  it could take a while before things fall into place  Soliris sales are expected to be lower in the second half of the year taking into account the favorable order timing in Q2 as well as the accelerating impact of the ALXN1210 studies Regeneron and Alexion are both Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  You can see  5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ",2017-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/regeneron-vs-alexion-which-stock-is-a-better-pick-post-q2-earnings-200207123,200207123

147037,368553,ALXN,Is A Beat In Store For Alexion  ALXN  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul  27  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  Alexion s earnings surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate  Alexion s track record is excellent as the company has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7 49  over the trailing four quarters Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement A look at Alexion s share price movement year to date shows that the stock has underperformed the Zacks classified  industry   While the company s shares have gained 4 1   the industry witnessed an addition of 10 6  in the same period Factors Likely to Impact Q2 ResultsAlexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS  with Soliris  across its 50 country operating platform  In order to further increase the commercial potential of the drug  Alexion is working on expanding Soliris  label into additional indications  Label expansion into additional indications would give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly  Additionally  the company is working on the launches of both Strensiq and Kanuma Strensiq continues to perform well with revenues benefiting from a growing number of patients  both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease  owing to HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives  These initiatives are leading to steady identification of new patients with hypophosphatasia  HPP   In fact  the company expects Strensiq to be an additional growth driver in 2017  and beyond Alexion is also looking to achieve annual cost synergies  which are expected to touch at least  150 million in 2017 Meanwhile  Alexion continues to progress with in country funding processes for both the products in additional countries in the EU this year Notably  the company s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive  particularly in case of ALXN1210  Currently  it is evaluating ALXN1210  a longer acting anti C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement  in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS  Additionally  the company is conducting a phase I study on a new formulation of ALXN1210  when administered subcutaneously in healthy volunteers Alexion plans to initiate a phase III PNH switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris  in 2017  Therefore  we expect investors to focus on updates from ALXN1210 as the successful development and commercialization of the drug will boost growth prospects However  with Soliris accounting for majority of revenues at Alexion  the company relies heavily on the drug for growth  Going forward  Soliris  below par performance might hurt the stock severly as it is considered to be Alexion s key growth driver  It is to be noted that the drug is already witnessing challenges in Latin America  Also  Soliris  quarter to quarter revenue growth will be impacted by the enrollment ramp up of trials on ALXN1210  by  70 million  110 million   particularly in the second half of 2017   Soliris revenues are expected to be down in the second quarter of 2017 What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat earnings in the to be

147088,368604,ALXN,Portage Biotech Stock May Be The Mightiest Micro Cap In The Market,opinion,"Portage Biotech Inc  OTC PTGEF 
When I first introduced Portage Biotech back in September of 2016  PTGEF was trading at just over twelve cents a share  at which time I made clear my feelings that the stock was grossly undervalued using almost any metric of measurement  At the time  management provided a compelling and informative interview and laid the framework for what lay ahead for this emerging company  Despite the under the radar position of the stock  quite a few investors did jump on board the PTGEF train  following the lead of an enormously successful and experienced management team that already owned roughly 50  of the outstanding shares 
It s never a bad idea to follow the insiders  and for those that respected the credibility of the company s leadership team  investors were treated to shares priced at roughly 50  less than where the stock trades today  The good news is that for those that missed the recent increase in PTGEF value  the stock remains mostly misunderstood and still significantly undervalued  Thus  an opportunity still knocks 
What s So Fast Moving 
Let s cut to the chase  For those that missed the buying opportunity at twelve cents a share  an opportunity exists to reconsider that decision and to purchase shares of PTGEF at levels which still don t efficiently price the value inherent to the company  Despite the fact that shares now trade approximately 80  higher from where they were in September  an opportunity is rearing its beautiful head once again  providing a clear basis in value that the market is unwittingly able to ignore  PTGEF has done its part  providing the investment clues and building an asset base that has grown significantly over the past two years  The problem is is that the market still appears to have selective reasoning capability  as well as the capacity to ignore reality  Well  not everyone in the market is ignoring the reality at the company  While it may be the case that retail investors have been slow to buy into the PTGEF story  there has been well over a hundred million dollars raised by the PTGEF management team to advance its company strategy  And  these financing s were on terms as good as or at least equal to some of the most respected biotech companies in the market  which says quite a lot about the credibility of this micro cap company 
Companies at a valuation similar to PTGEF are often plagued by cram down   buy at the market  finance deals  which get funded by a bunch of wolves dressed as virgin sheep  Not the case for PTGEF and from the terms I have read  most investors are giving praise  not pity on the accomplishments at the company  For that reason  PTGEF has attracted investors  those willing to embrace and encourage the vision of the enterprise  leading to substantial investments without the usual perks provided by desperate companies  The PTGEF agreements are mostly free from excessive dilution and warrant overhang  and insiders regularly contribute to the placements  Over time  PTGEF has become a well funded company  flush with an exceptional management team  and a vision that is delivering upon a multifaceted strategy that is on track to deliver meaningful shareholder value in the next 6 24 months 
I ve Liked PTGEF For A Long Time 
Hey  I m long the stock  and I made that known many months ago  In fact  while some questioned my credibility in investing in such a low priced company  I merely pointed to the facts  And while I didn t pound the table and make adamant pleas for investors to take a stake in PTGEF  I did at least lead them to the water  And  as the company has shown  I was not offering the proverbial kool aid  So  am I happy that some missed the first ride  perhaps keeping prices low for now  Nope  In fact  just the opposite  because based on what s to come  I expect that investors may finally get the message that PTGEF is the real deal  even at a share price 80  higher from where the company traded less than six months ago  But  even while accounting for the recent accomplishments at PTGEF  the investment thesis is just now starting to unfold  and I believe that the current momentum will carry forward the deal making prowess of the company 
Portage Biotech Is A Whole Lot Of Good
To keep this article under 10 000 words  only a brief introduction to the entire Portage Biotech can be obliged  However  please refer to my original interview with company management for an in depth presentation 
Portage Biotech is engaged in the discovery and development of pharmaceutical and biotech products through clinical proof of concept with a focus on areas of unmet clinical need  Because of the private nature of its investments  PTGEF has kept many trial details close to the vest  however  it s not hard to comprehend that management has been in full court press in their effort to increase shareholder value  Keep in mind that management owns roughly 130 million shares of the company  so a win for retail is a win for them 
As PTGEF tells it  once they find a proof of concept product  they do their best to get control and then seek to sell or license these products to large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for further development and commercialization  Taking advantage of opportunities that others may have discarded  PTGEF  with its diversified medical team  can evaluate potential opportunities in a given compound  Then  they weave in and use their expertise to reposition a drug to treat novel targeted therapies  utilizing stem cell therapies  and new indications for older marketed products that have unique and patentable characteristics with the ability to bring therapeutic value to patients 
It s the sum of the parts that make PTGEF valuable  And each of the parts is doing very  very well  It was rumored that President Trump once tweeted   Frankly  PTGEF is doing a magnificently great thing  believe me  they are   I m still searching for the cached tweet  but I do share in the enthusiasm 
OK  Tell Me The PTGEF Story 
I am flat out serious when I say that there is not a weak link at PTGEF  The company has ownership in three companies  all of which are privately held  But  not for long  so don t change the channel just yet   Spoiler Alert  One of them is going public 
PTGEF s three portfolio companies  Biohaven  Sentien  and Portage Pharmaceuticals  Ltd   PPL  are each independent entities with separate management teams that contribute to the overall valuation of PTGEF  The good news for interested newbies is that little value from these assets has trickled down to the share price  which offers a substantial opportunity to investors  Further  each of the three companies is beginning to hit its stride  successfully developing their compounds through both pre clinical and clinical trials  As these trials progress  assuming the data is promising  so should the value in PTGEF  Management has never shied away from the mission to increase shareholder value  and while the share price in PTGEF has grown substantially from 2016 levels  the most recent announcements by the company should continue to generate significant future value once the market begins to understand the real value within its previously guarded  private assets 
The strategy by PTGEF management is straight forward  Their investment in Biohaven  for instance  exemplifies the approach quite well  Approximately two years ago  the company provided critical early funding to Biohaven and helped assemble a highly experienced drug development team that previously worked at Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY   and Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ALXN   After assembling the management team  Biohaven then efficiently advanced its lead drug candidate  BHV 0223  its Orphan Drug to treat ALS  acquired additional assets and was granted two other Orphan Drug designations  positioning the company to have multiple drug candidates entering pivotal Phase 3 trials this year 
When PTGEF first invested in Biohaven  the initial valuation of the company was  7M  and Biohaven s last round of funding was at a  133M valuation  With success in its upcoming pivotal clinical trials  the expectation is that Biohaven s value may continue to rise and earn a level of return that investors should find attractive  The strategy used to develop Biohaven remains consistent throughout the PTGEF portfolio  finding and developing an opportunity that can maximize shareholder value 
Not only has the model shown that it can provide opportunity  but management has demonstrated their ability to build a small company into one that can potentially become a prominent story in the public markets  And  therein lay the Biohaven opportunity  whom just announced their IPO plans  and may lead to a financial windfall for PTGEF  who controls a 28 3  interest in the company 
The consummated Biohaven IPO will ultimately place a tangible dollar value on the interest owned  but  that book value is only a starting point  as any investor that discounts the ownership in both Sentien and PPL is likely on hallucinogenics 
Biohaven  BHVN  Is Coming Out
With the asset value at PTGEF being relatively unknown due to the private nature of the company structure  assigning a practical value to each asset has been difficult  Finally  the Biohaven IPO may begin to shred doubt as to how PTGEF should be valued 
Biohaven started to grab footing back in March of 2017 when they raised  80 million in a funding round that featured Osage University Partners and Connecticut Innovations  At that time  total funding into the company reached the  100 million mark  not small time by any means  Part of that  100 million came from insiders at PTGEF  with both John Childs and Dr  Greg Bailey contributing as angel investors  The announced financing followed the November spin out of Biohaven  who had already concluded a previous deal to raise an initial  40 million in funding 
Fast forward  Biohaven  BHVN  the expected trading symbol  has plans to go public with expectations to trade on the NYSE  And what may prove to be a substantial benefit to PTGEF shareholders  is that the company owns 28 3  of that deal  The IPO is expected to generate upwards of  100 million and will occur once the regulatory compliance sessions are over  Factoring in regulatory questions  responses  roadshows  etc   a closing in late 2017 is very likely  and despite shaky market sentiment on a macro basis  the appetite for this deal may remain voracious regardless of market opinion  Included in the table of investors are two undisclosed blue chip pharmaceutical companies that took a stake in Biohaven in 2016 
The IPO is being underwritten by a respectable list of deal makers  led by Morgan Stanley  Piper Jaffrey  Barclays Capital and others  In February 2017  BHVN obtained third party valuations  performed on a retrospective basis  of its common shares as of August 17  2015  the date the company first issued common shares and common share warrants in connection with their license agreement with ALS Biopharma  BHVN received updated valuations as of October 31  2016  the date of the first closing of its Series A preferred share financing  In addition to those two initial assessments  BHVN obtained third party valuations of its common shares as of various dates between December 31  2016  and March 31  2017 
The independent  third party assessments resulted in appreciating valuations of BHVN common shares of  5 23 per share as of August 17  2015   6 73 per share as of October 31  2016   7 45 per share as of December 31  2016   8 68 per share as of January 31  2017   9 85 per share as of February 28  2017 and  10 82 per share as of March 31  2017  These third party valuations were conducted by the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  Accounting and Valuation Guide  Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation 
To cipher it down into the potential value reflected back to PTGEF  investors can estimate value based on a fully diluted offering expected to bring the outstanding share count at BHVN to approximately 30 million shares  Assuming that BHVN did not appreciate a single penny since November of 2016  which is ridiculously unlikely  then PTGEF should be recognized at having slightly under  29 cents in share value based on that ownership stake alone  Going further  assuming that the mid range of valuation is given to BHVN once the IPO terms get settled  PTGEF s stake should afford them at least  38 cents in ownership book value  And in a best case  an oversubscribed IPO can bring more than  45 cents in book value to PTGEF  These prognostications are plain vanilla  black and white estimates for BHVN only  by the way  Actual BHVN value may likely include blue sky multiples  Additionally  those estimates include absolutely no value in the Sentien and PPL ownership  which are proving to have significant value and a growing asset base 
To substantiate these opinions  there is some history to the value in BHVN already  In January 2014  the company sold and issued 5 752 000 common shares to PTGEF at a purchase price of  0 61 per share for gross proceeds of  3 5 million  resulting in PTGEF becoming a beneficial owner of more than 5  of BHVN s outstanding shares  In July 2015  BHVN sold and issued 446 500 additional common shares to Portage at a purchase price of  5 60 per share for gross proceeds of  2 5 million  In February 2016  BHVN sold and issued 143 000 common shares to Portage at a purchase price of  7 00 per share for gross proceeds of  1 0 million  It s important to note that Dr  Declan Doogan  the chairman of BHVN s board of directors  is the chief executive officer of PTGEF 
The BHVN Affect
Here s the bottom line on BHVN  There has been an extraordinary amount of interest in the company for quite a while  And  while this article could yield thousands of words to discuss each and every promising asset that BHVN is capable of addressing in the near term  my purpose is to merely point out the value that is going to be directly beneficial to PTGEF from an ownership standpoint  Even with 260 million shares O S  the reflective value to PTGEF after the IPO should generate an additional 40  to its current share price  and if an investor should assume that the value of BHVN will increase over timer  then so shall the value in PTGEF  It s going to be quite a ride to follow  and with the two companies connected at the hip  investors will have quick insight as to when PTGEF shares are not being afforded fair value  offering an additional buying opportunity for potentially mispriced shares 
Sentien And Portage Pharmaceutical Ltd  Are Also Substantial Assets
Investors should be rightly excited about the BHVN deal  but there is substantially more intrinsic asset value that should not be neglected  and PTGEF is again a clear beneficiary 
Sentien Biotechnologies Inc  is an additional asset in the PTGEF portfolio and is generating impressive clinical data  As recent as April 7  2017  Sentien CEO Brian Miller announced that the company s IND application for its lead compound  SBI 101  has received clearance to proceed from the FDA  The combination therapy of SBI 101 combines mesenchymal stromol cells within an approved blood filtration device  which allows for a controlled and sustainable delivery of MSC secreted factors  The IND approval allows Sentien to initiate on its prospective multi center trial to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effect of SBI 101 
The randomized trial will be a controlled  multi dose phase I II study in patients with acute kidney injury  with endpoints measuring safety and efficacy of the treatment  Enrollment is pending and expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017  designed to enroll 24 patients with top line data scheduled for release in 2018  Sentien is well funded  having closed a  12 million Series A investment round announced on April 4th 
The next value magnet is PTGEF s ownership of Portage Pharmaceuticals Ltd   PPL  and EyGen Limited  PPL is currently negotiating a funding arrangement and appears to be in the final processes of bringing  1 million in convertible note financing for PPL  Good news for those that shriek at the term  convertible notes   insiders are participating in the deal  which demonstrates a vested interest in the quality and structure of the deal  PPL is continuing to develop new candidates using its Cellporter technology for cancer and other indications  The company is seeking additional collaborations that can make use of the Cellporter technology  an additional value enhancer for both PPL and PTGEF 
As for EyGen  the same PPL investor group has agreed to fund  1 5 million with a warrant for EyGen shares  Once again  PTGEF insiders will participate in the deal  EyGen is developing a topical ophthalmic formulation of PPL 003 for Dry Eye Disease and other inflammatory eye diseases 
Trial and study results are expected to be released intermittently as determined prudent by management  protecting proprietary data from potential competitors and taking advantages of its current position as a private company  which protects certain disclosure obligations 
PTGEF Still An Undervalued Gem
PTGEF at twelve cents was a gift  And  at twenty two cents  it still is  PTGEF is on the verge of recording a significant milestone from the BHVN IPO  whereby an intrinsic valuation can be appropriately prescribed  But  owning a 28 3  stake in BHVN is only a small part of the story  While the share price may have the ability to trend significantly higher once the deal closes  there is still considerable value to be created through Sentien and EyGen  Following the same methodology  investors may very well be on the right course to expect that additional value creation deals will be made with these two assets as well 
The management team at PTGEF is both strategic and exceptionally smart  As principal financiers in each of the company holdings  betting against these insiders may prove to be a foolish endeavor  PTGEF may very well be one of the best emerging micro cap stocks in the market  While I hold conviction in other small cap investments  few hold the promise that PTGEF does  who holds multiple opportunities for blockbuster treatments 
Undoubtedly  with shares trading at less than a quarter a share  many investors quickly turn a blind eye  believing that the price of a stock is at that level for a reason  But  with only a  55 million valuation  PTGEF may prove to be underpriced by as much as 50   Even if the company elects to sell some of their BHVN holdings to perpetuate additional Sentien and PPL trials  investors should have confidence that the money will be well spent  and if history repeats itself  will most likely lead to even larger gains 
To sum it up  I ve owned PTGEF for well over one year  and while the stock has only recently gained traction to the upside  the stock has all of the elements necessary to continue to build a robust and sustainable brand  They have management  science  cash  and diversity  For investors looking for a true ground floor opportunity  look no further  PTGEF may soon be moving substantially higher  don t miss the ride

147092,368608,ALXN,Alexion s  ALXN  Strensiq Results Positive In Long Term Study ,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   announced that researchers presented encouraging data on Strensiq at the European Calcified Tissue Society  ECTS  Congress in Austria 

Alexion s shares declined 4 4  year to date compared with the Zacks classified  industry s gain of 2 1  
The final data from the extension phase of the randomized  open label  dose ranging phase II trial of Strensiq showed the benefits of the drug achieved in adolescents and adults  ages 13 66 years at study entry  suffering from hypophosphatasia  HPP  within the first 6 months were sustained through 5 years of treatment 
The data from the study were in sync with the previously presented interim results 
The results were presented at the ECTS Congress in Austria 
The findings demonstrated a reduction in two key biomarkers of HPP disease activity  as well as improvements in physical function in patients treated with Strensiq  as observed in tests to measure walking distance  running speed and agility  and muscle strength 
We note that Strensiq is approved in the EU and the U S  as a bone targeted enzyme replacement therapy that treats the underlying cause of HPP by replacing the missing TNSALP enzyme 
Strensiq continues to perform well  Revenues continue to benefit from growing number of patients  both children as well as adults with pediatric onset disease  owing to HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives  These initiatives are leading to steady identification of new patients with HPP   Sales of the drug came in at  74 million  up from  33 million in the year ago quarter 
Concurrent with the first quarter results  the company maintained its revenues guidance while raised its earnings guidance for 2017  The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  5 10  5 30 up from its previously guidance range of  5 00  5 25  Revenues are expected around  3 4  3 5 billion 
We expect growth at Alexion to continue being driven by Soliris while new products like Strensiq and Kanuma should boost performance which in turn should reduce the company s dependence on Soliris for growth  We are also impressed by Alexion s efforts to develop its pipeline

Chairman Comments
Leonard Bell  M D   Chairman of the Board of Directors  said 

This leadership transition comes during a period of great strength and momentum  The fundamentals of Alexion are very strong  We have three highly effective therapies and a robust rare disease pipeline  We are well positioned for sustainable growth  Moreover  we have a clear strategy to continue our mission to develop and deliver transformative therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases    

Analyst Notes
We would expect shares to be down at least 10 15  based on what looks like a massive shake up at Alexion after an investigation that commenced on sales in early Nov right before our Credit Suisse healthcare conference  We are very surprised by the Alexion announcement removing CEO and long time CFO  Based on this news  it would lead us to believe that former CEO Hallal  who ran commercial  before was involved  We note that David Hallal had joined Alexion in 2006  We were especially surprised by Vikas leaving as well  
From our conversations  we think many had hoped Lenny Bell might come back as CEO  We don t know if that is out of the question but seems like a no since they have an interim search underway  The company has appointed an interim CEO who was on the board and was previously at AZ as CEO  The company reiterated the need for no restatement historically  We don t know how this impacts revenues going forward  The company expects to file their 10Q in January 2017 or earlier so that may help to answer the question  
With this type of shake up  we would guess a question will be what is the company worth if they were to be acquired  Understanding what a M A valuation for the company here is hard to say  based not fully on knowing impact to revenues going forward  Our back of the envelope M A valuation suggests  167  200 share  If we keep our base case and apply 10  cuts to R D and SG A  our Alexion M A valuation is  200  meaning those cuts add  35 sh in synergies  
 However  we model 1210 separately and assume 75  success on  2 8B in 1210 revenues  We also include some credit for NMO  25  POS on  870M revs   MPSIIIB  25  POS on  370M revs   If we remove these pipeline items  ex 1210 and MG at 50    our Alexion M A valuation is  183  If we remove MG but keep OpEx cuts our DCF is  167    CreditSuisse

Well the final countdown to Janet Yellen s speech at midnight AEST has begun  and after a week where most markets have barely moved from where they started  there are likely a number of traders who would relish a bit of volatility this evening  There certainly is a fear evident in markets that Janet Yellen is going to be surprisingly hawkish and talk up a September hike  this may be devoid of any real evidence apart from constant calls from the band of perma hawk US economists  but  nonetheless  market liquidity has dried up in fear  Volumes have been down all week  while the volume on the S P 500 overnight was more than 15  below its 100 day moving average and the Dow Jones had volumes down more than 27  
The gold price has been battered this week as the threat of rising US bond yields has seen it lose 1 5   Gold has been relatively well cushioned above the US 1 312 level since the start of July  but has been pulling back to this support level as hawkish Fed commentary has picked up in the past two weeks  Of course  should Yellen fail to follow through on her  expectedly hawkish  comments about an imminent September rate hike  gold could well be set for a rally 

US durable goods and capital goods orders both performed well overnight  Durable goods ex transport gained 1 5  month on month  MoM  and capital goods nondefense ex aircraft gained 1 6  MoM  If you saw these sorts of figures replicated throughout the third quarter that would be very positive for GDP and could help remove the major drag that we saw from inventories in 2Q  which could provide the basis for a December rate hike  But there are a lot of ifs yet before that happens 

The scandal over Mylan s pricing of its EpiPen has spilled into the broader healthcare sector in the S P 500 overnight with the sector losing 0 8   This is not the first time that Hillary Clinton has emphasised her concerns over seemingly egregious price hikes for healthcare products  and with her dramatically leading in the polls  a number of investors began to pile out of other high pricing biotechs  Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  has dropped 5 9  in two days as the Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  saga blew up because it mostly relies on the revenue from one of the most expensive drugs in the world   Soliris   a treatment for rare blood disorders that costs US 500 000 a year  These parts of the market may continue to struggle in the lead up to the US election if Clinton s prospects of success continues to firm 

Asian markets are set to open relatively flat  It is likely to be a fairly low volume and unexciting Asian session as many investors sit on the sidelines ahead of Janet Yellen s speech  Oil saw a nice bounce overnight as Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh confirmed he would attend the OPEC meeting in September  which should be a positive for energy stocks  Materials stocks were the best performer in the S P 500 overnight  and BHP s ADR rallied 1 2  boding well for the ASX session today ",2016-08-26,IG,https://www.investing.com/analysis/thoughts-from-collins-place-200150216,200150216

147169,368685,ALXN,Alexion s  ALXN  Rare Disorder Drug Gets EU Orphan Status ,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   announced that the European Commission has granted orphan drug designation to ALXN1210 for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH  
The European Commission usually grants orphan medicinal product status in order to provide incentives to candidates that are being developed to treat  prevent or diagnose diseases or conditions affecting no more than 5 in 10 000 people in the EU  In addition to providing Alexion with certain benefits and incentives  this status will also allow ALXN1210 to enjoy a period of market exclusivity in the EU  upon approval 
We note that ALXN1210 is a longer acting C5 antibody being developed by Alexion for the treatment of patients with PNH  a life threatening and ultra rare genetic blood disorder 
Currently  Alexion is evaluating ALXN1210 in a dose escalating  phase I II study and an open label  multi dose phase II study in patients with PNH  Preliminary results from ongoing studies on ALXN1210 have shown rapid  complete  and sustained reduction of free C5 activity and a terminal half life of more than 30 days than that of Soliris  which may facilitate a monthly or longer dosing interval 
The company also intends to evaluate ALXN1210 for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  aHUS  this year 
We note that Soliris is Alexion s key growth driver  which is approved for the treatment of both PNH and aHUS  Alexion is also developing Soliris for several additional indications including generalized myasthenia gravis and delayed kidney transplant graft function among others

147170,368686,ALXN,Alexion s Soliris Misses Phase III Primary Efficacy Endpoint,opinion,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   announced disappointing top line data  as per which Soliris failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint in a phase III study  REGAIN  in patients suffering from refractory generalized myasthenia gravis  gMG   We expect investors to react negatively to the news 
The randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multi center study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Soliris in patients with refractory gMG  The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in a patient reported assessment   Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Profile total score at week 26 as measured by a worst rank analysis   failed to achieve statistical significance 
However  the study did meet the first three secondary efficacy endpoints and a series of prospectively defined sensitivity analyses  which showed early and sustained substantial improvements in patients when treated with Soliris compared to placebo over a period of 26 weeks  Moreover  the safety profile of Soliris in this study was found to be consistent with the drug s labels 
Alexion said that it continues to analyze the phase III study results and intends to meet with regulatory authorities to decide on the path forward  The company plans to present detailed results at the International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases next month 
Per the company s press release  refractory gMG is an ultra rare segment of MG  which is a complement mediated neuromuscular disease  Most gMG patients continue to suffer from this debilitating condition despite treatment with existing MG therapies 
Considering the lack of approved therapies for refractory gMG  there is a significantly unmet need for treatments addressing this disease  We note that Soliris has been granted orphan drug status in the U S   EU  and Japan for the treatment of patients with MG 
Soliris  which is currently approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  is a key growth driver at Alexion  In 2015  the drug registered sales of  2 59 billion

147191,368707,ALXN,Why The Bull Market In Biotech Will Continue  Part 2 of 2 ,opinion,"Last week  I discussed how patent expirations are affecting the biotech sector   particularly big names like Astrazeneca Plc  NYSE AZN   I also explained why these larger pharmaceutical firms have been steadily gobbling up small companies left and right   
And  in the process  they ve created sizable paydays for investors who got in at the right time 
Today we re going to look at a few other factors driving biotech higher   
The Silver Tsunami
America s population is getting older  All of those baby boomers are becoming grandparents  retiring and entering their golden years 
Roughly 10 000 boomers turn 65 every day  In 15 years  there will be 75 million Americans over the age of 65  including the youngest of the baby boomers   That s up from 44 7 million in 2013  
And as people get older they tend to get sicker and require more healthcare  According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  82  of Medicare beneficiaries have at least one chronic condition  The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on healthcare will go from 4  of America s GDP in 2007 to 7  in 2025  By 2050  that number should rise to 12  
As Americans spend more on healthcare  an increasing percentage of those expenses will be on biotech drugs  Biologics already make up 24  of total drug sales  accounting for  221 billion in annual spending 
Furthermore  biologics are attractive to big pharma companies because they often carry a higher price point  Cancer treating biologics often cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment  And drugs for rare diseases can cost six figures per year  with many patients dependent on therapy for the rest of their lives 
For example  Soliris  which is made by Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN   is the most expensive drug in the world  It treats a rare and sometimes fatal form of anemia  It costs around  440 000 per year 
These kinds of drugs will have an increasing role over the coming years  Tons of research is being conducted in immunotherapy and other new ways of fighting a wide variety of conditions  such as cancer and diabetes 
And with all of the upcoming patent expirations   which I talked about last week   there will be tremendous interest in the sector from large pharmaceutical companies looking to add to their research capabilities  pipelines and product offerings 

Why the Uptrend Should Continue
To top it all off  the fundamentals for this sector look great  And so do the technicals 
You can see from the chart above that the ARCA Biotechnology has been in a strong uptrend since 2012  It s actually been rising since 2009  but the index has followed this uptrend line perfectly for the past three years 
There s a saying in technical analysis that a trend in motion stays in motion  In other words  these types of trends tend to stay in effect until they break down meaningfully 
As shown above  we could even experience a 10  correction in the index and still be in the long term uptrend 
In fact  if we did see the index pull back 10   I d be buying with both hands 
This is about as strong and perfect of a trend as you ll see on a chart  And it suggests we should see higher prices for the foreseeable future 
The angle of the trend is not too steep  which means it s sustainable  Sometimes when a stock or index rises too fast  even if it tracks along a trend line  it can t maintain that momentum for very long  But this trend line is the kind that you d find in a technical analysis textbook 
It s reassuring when the technicals and fundamentals point in the same direction 
Biotech is a sector you have to be in over the coming decade  It has its risks  And it can be volatile  But over the years  it should generate extraordinary returns as new medicines come on the market and smaller companies get gobbled up by larger ones 
It s my favorite sector in the market and I strongly encourage you to have some portion of your portfolio invested in biotech stocks ",2015-05-28,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-bull-market-in-biotech-will-continue-(part-2-of-2)-253142,253142
147192,368708,ALXN,Is There An Acquisition In Gilead Sciences  Future ,opinion," NASDAQ GILD  reports its FQ2  15 results after the closing bell today  Both Estimize and Wall Street are predicting a fall in EPS and revenues QoQ  Estimize are forecasting an EPS figure of  2 77 and a revenue target of  7 540B  Wall Street estimates EPS to come in at  2 64 and revenues to be  7 360B 

The success of Gilead over the past 36 months can be attributed to the company s strong revenue growth figures which have blown expectations out of the water consistently over the past 2 years  However  this metric has recently experienced a slowdown and is expected to only further decline  As payers begin to balk at the high price tags of Gilead s Hepatitis C drugs including Sovaldi and Harvoni  sales are expected to be negatively affected 
Despite the potential negatives associated with falling revenue growth  Gilead is in a very strong position in terms of its balance sheet  Gilead has the ability to use its balance sheet to its advantage and potentially acquire desirable businesses in an attempt to bolster growth over the coming years  However  Gilead s management have informed the market that they will not rush into a transaction and pay too much to acquire another company  In February  Gilead announced to the market that they will start paying a  0 43 quarterly dividend and launch a  15B share buyback program  Importantly  the market has previously rewarded drugmakers engaging in M A activity 
Companies such as AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  and Alexion Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ALXN  have both benefited from their M A strategies and are both trading at considerable premiums since their acquisition announcements  These success stories place more pressure on Gilead s management to act sooner rather than later with respect to making acquisitions 
Investors will be eager to hear from management with respect to both increasing competition and also their M A strategy moving forward  Investors have become accustomed to Gilead outperforming analyst expectations  therefore if there is a miss today  the stock could potentially experience a significant pull back depending on the severity ",2015-07-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-gilead-sciences-about-to-make-an-acquisition-259654,259654
147193,368709,ALXN,What Lies Ahead For Biotech ETFs ,opinion,"The biotech sector has had a rough start to the year with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declining 17 5  year to date  Compare this to the spectacular performance over the last few years and one wonders whether the dream run for the sector is over 

Biotech stocks have been under immense pressure since Sep 2015 due to sector specific issues like increasing political and media focus on high price tags for new drugs and the changing competitive scenario as well as other factors like oil prices  global terrorism and China 
Pricing Concerns 

Both pharma and biotech companies are under a lot of pressure regarding the high price tags for new drugs  Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton s  price gouging  tweet triggered a slide in healthcare stocks in Sep 2015  Since then  the issue has been gaining focus and is not likely to die down easily    while presidential candidates may have differing opinions about other matters  all are pretty much on the same page where the high prices of drugs are concerned  Proposed health care plans include suggestions on how to rein in the prices of new drugs   Read   
Biosimilar Competition  A New Challenge

Last year  the FDA approved the first biosimilar in the U S    Sandoz s Zarxio   a biosimilar of Amgen s Neupogen  The approval is a landmark decision and follows years of debate regarding the regulatory path for biosimilars  Unlike their pharma counterparts  biotech companies have not been exposed to generic competition in the U S  But with the approval of Zarxio  the floodgates have opened 

Several companies are currently working on bringing in biosimilar versions of multi billion dollar revenue generating products like Enbrel and Humira among others 
Deals to Continue

Licensing agreements and deals including those with opt in arrangements should continue being signed this year with immuno oncology remaining a favorite area  Moreover  with valuations approaching reasonable levels  we could see several merger and acquisition agreements being announced as the year progresses  Quite a few of the major biotech companies are rumored to be on the look out for suitable deals   Read   
New Products Should Gain Traction

Highly awaited new products that gained approval last year should contribute significantly to revenues  Some of the important new product approvals include cystic fibrosis treatment  Orkambi  heart failure treatment  Corlanor  PCSK9 inhibitors  Repatha and Praluent  and Genvoya  HIV  

While 45 new molecular entities  NMEs  and Biologics License Applications  BLAs  were approved by the FDA last year  so far in 2016  the FDA has approved 5 NMEs and BLAs and has expanded the label of cancer drugs like Kyprolis and Imbruvica   Read

Conclusion 

High risk and high returns    this is a term that is often associated with the biotech sector  Biotech drugs  which are developed through a biological process system or by using living organisms  require a lot of investment  The drugs are complex in nature and take several years to develop  Companies which hit the bull s eye become overnight success stories with shares even doubling or tripling on positive news  However  negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies 

Strong pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  growing demand for drugs especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth in this sector 

On the flip side  the high cost of treatments  pricing controversies and the threat of biosimilars remain dampeners for this high risk high return sector ",2016-05-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-lies-ahead-for-biotech-etfs-200129894,200129894

147220,368736,ALXN,Biotechs Still A Trader s Paradise ,opinion,"One of the most speculative parts of the equity market is biotechnology  These stocks come to market generally overpriced  and they usually require a lot more capital to develop anything material 
But while investment risk is super high with these stocks  a drug that s in demand and has high barriers to competitive entry can pay off tremendously 
One company that fits this scenario is Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ALXN  out of Cheshire  Connecticut  The company s main offering is  Soliris   and it s a huge moneymaker 
Soliris was approved for use in the U S  and European Union markets in 2007  and then in Japan in 2010  It s the only drug that helps in the treatment of patients with a rare blood disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  PNH   which is a genetic disorder 
It s a growth story we ve looked at before in these pages  and with consistency  share price retrenchments have been buying opportunities 
According to Alexion  net product sales of Soliris were  567 million in the first quarter of 2014  compared to  339 million for the same quarter in 2013 
The company generated GAAP net earnings of  159 million  or  0 79 per share  in the first quarter of 2014  compared to GAAP net earnings of  82 0 million  or  0 41 per share  the year earlier 
The company finished the first quarter with  1 55 billion in cash and full year 2014 non GAAP earnings per share guidance was raised to  4 75 to  4 85 per share from the previous  4 37 to  4 47 
Alexion s share price definitely got caught up in the recent speculative fervor affecting the biotechnology sector and was a worthy sell for profit taking and risk management purposes 
The position is somewhere around 20 points down from its previous record high  and I wouldn t be surprised if it climbs back up there  even though the company is very expensively priced 
One time wonder drug companies can often keep their stock market price momentum for considerable periods  as Alexion illustrates  This is why  for risk capital speculators  constant perusing of 52 week highs set in this sector is a worthwhile endeavor 
There is still a lot of money swashing around these stocks  and it s a good place to be for the most aggressive traders 
And that s what these stocks are trades  Smaller biotechnology stocks are replete with extreme price volatility  Periods of genuine drug development and stock market success are easily reversed  And it s all beyond your control as an investor  with so many variables that affect the potential outcome 
Therefore  a heavy dose of risk management is appropriate with these positions  and none of them should be considered appropriate for conservative equity portfolios 
Like all capital markets  speculative fervor is perpetually changing and enthusiasm for a particular group of stocks goes in and out of style 
Due to the inherent investment risk with biotechnology stocks  only a small portion of risk capital should be allocated to the sector from a portfolio perspective 
With this in mind  as an industry  the amount of capital that s thrown at it by institutional investors is significant simply because the potential rewards in successful drug development are so great  as Alexion so perfectly illustrates

147221,368737,ALXN,Top Trade Ideas For The Week Of December 15  2014,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ALXN 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals  is heading toward support and the rising 50 day SMA  As it gets there this time the RSI has lost the mid line and is falling while the MACD is running down  both supporting more downside price action 
Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX 
Express Scripts  broke the rising trend support Friday and is approaching horizontal support with a gap to fill below  The RSI is falling  but has worked off a technically overbought condition while the MACD crossed down and is moving lower supporting more downside price action 
Eaton  NYSE ETN 
Eaton rejected at resistance and Friday broke the consolidation range to a new lower low with a near bearish Marubozu candle  The RSI is into the bearish zone while the MACD is running lower  both supporting more downside price action 
3M Company  NYSE MMM 
3M moved higher out of an expanding wedge in October and stalled at the target higher right around 163  After what could be consolidation it broke support Friday to a lower low  The RSI is cracking below the mid line and the MACD is running lower  These support more downside 
PVH Corp  NYSE PVH 
PVH is approaching a resistance zone from a higher low as it bounced off of the 200 day SMA last week  The RSI held in the bullish zone and is turning back higher while the MACD just crossed up  both supporting more upward price action 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the last full week of the year sees the equity markets showing weakness  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its short term uptrend while Crude Oil continues the trend lower  but with perhaps a short term bounce  The US Dollar Index looks to move sideways in the uptrend while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite is finally consolidating its strong move in the uptrend while Emerging Markets look to continue their fall lower  Volatility looks to remain slightly elevated in the low zone keeping the short term bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPY  iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and QQQ  The S P 500 and QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ look weakest and have room to pullback more while the IWM is consolidating but at the bottom of the range  so also vulnerable  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

147222,368738,ALXN,Biotech Companies May Produce Blockbusters In 2015  But There Are Risks,opinion,"In the healthcare space  2014 was the year of hepatitis C  April saw the biotechnology industry take heavy losses as investors began to view stocks as overvalued following strong performance throughout 2013  But the launch of hepatitis C cure  Harvoni  by Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD  seemed to force the realization that mega blockbusters addressing big unmet needs could still generate game changing profits  Then came controversy over the cure s pricing  and fear of pushback from regulators  When those fears didn t materialize  the biotech stocks resumed their climb  But later in 2014  the arrival of a competitive hepatitis C product from AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  presented an opening to pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs  such as Express Scripts to negotiate aggressively for lower prices  Biotech stocks reacted with a shudder  
Express Scripts Holding Company  NASDAQ ESRX  also noted that it intends to apply the same aggressive negotiation to other drug categories  including oncology drugs  This is happening just as some promising next generation cancer treatments    so called  immuno oncology  drugs    are nearing the market  with potential blockbuster status and likely blockbuster prices  Wherever there is competition    and GILD has shown us that it is very difficult to build a moat in the biotech industry    there will be scope for PBMs to cut deals  use biotech competition to their advantage  and drive prices down for the consumer  
Profits May Be Under Pressure    But They Could Still Be Very Large
 However  the market may overreact to fears of price wars and competition  We see two spaces within the biotech industry where  for different reasons  profits may still be robust    One is the orphan drug space  Orphan indications are rare diseases  frequently genetic  where the patient population is typically very small  During the initial promulgation and roll out of the Affordable Care Act  ACA   we feared that orphan indications would come under pressure and that budgets for their development would begin to dry up  That prospect made companies that focus on orphan indications seem problematic  However  the ACA has not yet had this effect    and if competition is the key to new price pressures in the biotech industries  orphan drugs may be one place where biotech profits can be preserved  Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ALXN  is one such company  they manufacture a blockbuster drug called Soliris which treats two rare genetic disorders and costs more than  500 000 a year    the world s most expensive pharmaceutical  This year they will likely launch another such drug  asfotase alfa  which could also reach blockbuster status  more than  1 billion in sales per year  in spite of the small patient population 



Another possible haven in biotech where profits may still be robust is in areas of significant unmet need  Hepatitis C itself may fall under this category  The pie of available patients is huge    since until now there has simply been no cure at all  It will take many years to work through the existing population of hep C patients  GILD analysts may have to revise their revenue projections downward    but we think those revenues will still be robust  One area where unmet needs may be big enough to support several entrants is the next generation of anti cholesterol drugs  Amgen Inc  NASDAQ AMGN  and a team of Sanofi  NYSE  SNY  and Regeneron  NASDAQ REGN   NASDAQ  REGN  are nearing commercialization of drugs which inhibit an enzyme called PCSK9 
Data that came from Merck in November bolstered the claim that lower cholesterol actually leads to lowered rates of death from heart disease  The new PCSK9 inhibitors face competition from one another as well as from generics  as current anti cholesterol blockbusters go off patent   There are also unresolved legal issues between the competitors   Should their efficacy prove high enough  though  they could become blockbusters themselves even in the face of all that competition 
Investment implications  Pricing pushback from PBMs may crimp biotechnology companies  profits  and the industry may not fly as high as it did in 2013 and 2014  However  orphan indications and new treatments for widespread chronic conditions could both continue to generate good profits for biotechs  even in the face of pricing pressures and payer pushback  In the first  competition will be muted  and in the second  the pie may be big enough for all competitors to profit  Nonetheless this is a very exciting sector with opportunities for investors ",2015-01-20,Tim Shirata,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/biotech-companies-may-produce-blockbusters-in-2015,-but-there-are-risks-239099",239099

147224,368740,ALXN,Why The Bull Market In Biotech Will Continue  Part 1 of 2 ,opinion,"If you ve been paying any attention at all to the stock market  you know that the  has been on fire  The Amex Biotechnology Index is up 19  year to date  versus a 3  gain for the S P 500  

Over the past two years  the index has more than doubled   up 106   At the same time  the S P 500 has climbed 29  

The huge move in biotech has caused many skeptics to declare that the sector is in a bubble  And the recent acquisition of Synageva BioPharma Corp  NASDAQ GEVA  by Alexion Pharmaceuticals  Nasdaq  NASDAQ ALXN  for a 140  premium did little to  that they are wrong 

They are wrong 


Patent Expirations

It s no secret that the giant pharma companies are scrambling to replace drugs that are losing their patents and facing generic competition  Hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue are at stake 

For example  Astrazeneca Plc  NYSE AZN  just reported lower first quarter profits after the patent for its acid reflux medicine Nexium expired  Sales of the drug fell 31   The company s cholesterol fighter Crestor will lose patent protection next year  Combined  these two drugs make up a third of AstraZeneca s revenue 

The story is the same across nearly every large pharmaceuticals company  As a result  big pharma is constantly on the prowl for new drugs to replace lost revenue 

That means smaller companies stand to benefit as the drug giants go shopping  either for individual drugs or for entire companies  Their ultimate goal is to obtain a pipeline of multiple drug prospects   or a certain technology that is used to create drugs 

The way a partnership for an individual drug works is like this 

Biotech Company A has a drug that just finished Phase 1 trials with promising data  Big Pharma Company B pays the biotech company  20 million in cash for the rights to develop and market the drug 

The larger company now takes on the expense  and risk  of clinical trials  Along the way  the biotech company is entitled to  100 million in milestone payments  These might occur after     at the beginning and end of Phase 3 trials    and if when the drug is granted final approval 

Additionally  the smaller company will get a royalty payment on sales of the drug once it s on the market 

Obviously  the numbers vary depending on each company s characteristics 


Insatiable Appetites

As drug companies become more desperate  they are willing to pay higher amounts for drugs 

In January  for example  Amgen  Nasdaq  NASDAQ AMGN  said it would pay Kite Pharma  NASDAQ KITE   60 million for access to its cancer drug that had yet to be tested in humans  Kite is eligible for another  525 million in milestone payments as the drug progresses through development 

Of course  sometimes one drug isn t enough to satisfy the insatiable appetites of large pharmaceutical companies  They want all the drugs  So they buy the entire company and gain access to its pipeline  This often includes  just as importantly  patented technology 

In March  Cellular Dynamics agreed to be acquired by Fujifilm Holdings for  16 50 per share  The stock closed at  7 94 in the trading session prior to the announcement  Cellular Dynamics had  16 7 million in sales in 2014  Its technology will allow Fujifilm to produce fully functioning human cells 

Also in March  Teva Pharmaceutical  Nasdaq  ARCA TEVA  agreed to a  3 5 billion buyout of Auspex  NASDAQ ASPX  Pharmaceuticals to obtain its drug for Huntington s disease  Teva also gained access to its pipeline of drugs for Parkinson s disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  The  101 per share price represents a 42  premium to where the stock closed just before the announcement 


Everybody s Getting In on the Action

Biotech stocks have always enjoyed much larger acquisition premiums than the rest of the market  With demand so high for new drugs and technology  I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future 

It s never a good idea to buy a stock simply because you think the company will get acquired  But as long as huge premiums are being paid for biotech stocks  big money will likely continue to pour into the sector 

Even some large investors who don t normally invest in biotech are getting in on the action  John Paulson of Paulson   Co   who made billions betting against the U S  subprime mortgage market in 2007  recently bought over 2  of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ SGYP  

Synergy is known to biotech aficionados  but is not front of mind to most big money managers
