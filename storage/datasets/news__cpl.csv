34285,255800,CPL,Will Brazilian Stocks Benefit From The Summer Olympics  ,opinion,"Smart investors should be looking for ways to make money on just about anything  and that includes events that are seemingly not related to the financial markets  With the Summer Olympics on the horizon  the world s eyes will be on the Games in Rio  and that means investors  eyes should be there too 
Past Trends
If we want to make money during this year s Olympics  we first have to identify how the market has trended during past Olympic events  Interestingly enough  there appears to be a positive correlation between market activity and the Summer Olympic Games 
According to   which traced market performance during the 26 Summer Olympics since 1900  the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained an average of 4  between the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games  Overall  there have been positive returns during 68  of the Summer Olympics 
In recent years  performance has been mixed  During the London Games  the DJIA gained 2 5   and the 2004 Games in Athens saw returns of 3 76   On the other hand  the Beijing Summer Olympics  which were held in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis  saw the market lose about 1  
It s also important to note that host countries generally see gains that mirror that of the American markets  One exception to note is that the Shanghai Composite dove about 7 7  during the 2008 Games 
Conditions in Brazil
Of course  we also need to take a look at the economic conditions in Brazil at the moment  Those who have been keeping in touch with the South American nation in the lead up to these Olympics will know that Brazil has seen its fair share of economic and political instability lately 
In May  President Dilma Rousseff was suspended from her role to face impeachment on corruption charges  Just a few weeks ago  a conservative lawmaker who led the ouster of Rousseff was forced to resign from his position following accusations that he accepted up to  40 million in bribes  Long story short  the Brazilian government has been a bit of a mess over the last year or so 
More recently  however  there has been some improvements in the political climate  A couple weeks back  Acting President Michel Temer and Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles announced that the country s annual deficit would be reduced in 2017  Brazil s stock market hit an eight week high in response to the news 
Some of Brazil s major economic giants have been rebounding throughout the year as well  Shares of primarily state owned oil company Petrobras   NYSE PBR   have gained over 90  on the year  and the Brazilian portion of  is up 24  over the same timeframe  The custom fund  which is also up 28  over the past month  holds positions in Telefonica   NYSE VIV    TIM Brasil   NYSE TSU    CPFL Energia   NYSE CPL    Sabesp   NYSE SBS    Electrobras   OTC EBRYY    CEMIG   NYSE CIG    and COPEL   NYSE ELP   
Tickers to Watch
For the most part  the Rio Olympics and the remaining political uncertainty should already be priced in to Brazilian stocks  With that said  there could be a few tickers that see a nice period of green during and after the Games 
First of all  investors that feel confident about the state of the Brazilian economy should check out the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF   This ETF uses a 25 50 capped methodology and tracks the overall performance of the equities market in Brazil  This ETF has been slowly gaining throughout July  and if the Rio Olympics go off without a hitch  it could continue to climb as a result 
Investors might also want to check out AmBev   NYSE ABEV    the Brazilian subsidiary of Anheuser Busch InBev   NYSE BUD    AmBev is the biggest brewery in Latin America  and the company also distributes a large portion of PepsiCo   NYSE PEP   products throughout the region 
This one comes from a simple idea  people love to drink  especially at major sporting events  Again  the Olympics are certainly factored into AmBev s current price  but the continued economic recovery of Brazil could help boost this stock even further 
Bottom Line
While there has been plenty of instability in Brazil for some time now  it s finally looking like the government and some of the major companies are turning things around  Investors should continue to look toward the Olympics as a unique investing opportunity  In the past  the markets have favored the Summer Games  and some stocks could be ready to take off ",2016-07-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-brazilian-stocks-benefit-from-the-summer-olympics-200142816,200142816

34297,255812,CPL,AES Corp  AES   Stock To Beat Q2 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"The AES Corporation   NYSE AES   is scheduled to report second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 5  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 31 58   The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  still recording an average negative surprise of 9 89  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement AES CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that AES Corp  is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  and AES Corp  has the right mix Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  11 11   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 20 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged slightly lower at 18 cents  This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Zacks Rank  AES Corp  s Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings During the first quarter earnings call  the company hinted at relatively weak first half 2016 earnings per share due to a scheduled major maintenance in the second quarter  It also mentioned that its first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX  lower power prices in the U S  and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tiet  in Brazil  This will likely continue in the second quarter as well  adversely impacting the bottom line However  the company remains on track to achieve its three year  150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals  AES Corp  aims to achieve  50 million in 2016 and the remaining  100 million through 2018 Moreover  the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year 
AES Corp  excepts the second quarter to be lower than normal  In fact  it had forecast that 70  to 75  of its 2016 adjusted earnings per share would be recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60  in past years The company has been under pressure of currency headwinds over the past few quarters  Unlike most of the utilities in the U S   AES Corp  has its presence in many countries  exposing it to currency risk  For that  it is streamlining its business risk profile  During the second quarter  AES Corp  has signed an agreement to sell its entire equity interest in AES Sul in southern Brazil to CPFL Energia S A    NYSE CPL    the largest private utility in the country If the U S  dollar continues to remain strong compared to emerging market currencies  AES Corp  s earnings may be impacted Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of operators in the electric utility space worth considering  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Pattern Energy Group Inc    NASDAQ PEGI   has an Earnings ESP of  100 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release second quarter results on Aug 8 Great Plains Energy Inc    NYSE GXP   has an Earnings ESP of  14 63  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is expected to release second quarter results on Aug 4 Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-08-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aes-corp-(aes):-stock-to-beat-q2-earnings-estimates-200145912,200145912
