211952,433468,BMY,How Bristol Myers Squibb Trounced Wall Street s Q4 Estimates,news,"All you have to do to gauge how good Bristol Myers Squibb s  NYSE BMY  fourth quarter numbers were is look at the drugmaker s share price  The company announced its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Thursday  Shares jumped close to 3  in early trading 
Investors were obviously happy with BMS  Q4 results  And there was one overwhelming factor behind the company s success in the quarter  Its recent acquisition of Celgene 

Blowing past Wall Street estimates
To say that Bristol Myers Squibb beat Wall Street s Q4 estimates is an understatement  It absolutely trounced them 
The average analysts  revenue estimate for BMS in the fourth quarter was  6 14 billion  BMS reported Q4 revenue of  7 9 billion  up 33  year over year 
What about earnings  The consensus Wall Street estimate called for BMS to post adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  0 88  The company s actual adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter came in at  1 22  
There was a catch  of course  Analysts didn t include the impact of the Celgene acquisition in their estimates  Bristol Myers Squibb closed that acquisition on Nov  20  2019  so its fourth quarter results reflected more than one month of revenue generated by Celgene s products 
In total  BMS  revenue increased by  1 97 billion year over year in Q4  Celgene s top five drugs generated  1 85 billion of that growth  Were it not for BMS  acquisition of Celgene  we would be talking about how the company missed Wall Street estimates instead of blowing past them 
Growing and slowing
That s not to say that Bristol Myers Squibb didn t have some of its own growth drivers  Its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis raked in sales of  2 03 billion in the fourth quarter  up 19  year over year  Sales for arthritis drug Orencia jumped 8  to  792 million  BMS  fastest rising star in Q4 was multiple myeloma drug Empliciti  with sales soaring 36  year over year 
However  not all of BMS  lineup performed well during the fourth quarter  Most significantly  the company s powerhouse cancer immunotherapy Opdivo saw sales slip 2  year over year to  1 76 billion  Sales for hepatitis B drug Baraclude sank 26  lower to  122 million  BMS  other established brands  which include several older antiviral drugs plus some of Celgene s legacy products  experienced a 39  sales decline 
Celgene s top drugs clearly made the difference in producing a great quarter versus a dismal quarter for Bristol Myers Squibb  Even better  sales for those drugs are growing rapidly 
BMS reported Q4 net sales  which include sales made prior to and after the acquisition of Celgene  for blood cancer drug Revlimid of  2 8 billion  up 10  year over year  Sales for another blood cancer drug gained with the Celgene acquisition  Pomalyst  jumped 23  higher  Celgene s cancer drug Abraxane pulled in close to  300 million  a 25  year over year increase 
The Celgene deal also caused Bristol Myers Squibb s costs to rise  though  BMS said that its marketing  selling  and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter grew 30  year over year primarily due to  400 million in spending related to its acquisition of Celgene  The buyout boosted BMS  research and development costs by  500 million in Q4  
In addition  BMS recorded  1 1 billion for the amortization of acquired intangible assets mainly due to the Celgene transaction  Its income taxes were also much higher thanks primarily to the sale of Celgene s immunology drug Otezla to Amgen 
What s on the way
Bristol Myers Squibb projects full year 2020 revenue will be between  40 5 billion and  42 5 billion  The company expects full year 2020 adjusted EPS of between  6 and  6 20  BMS even provided early guidance for full year 2021  with the drugmaker projecting adjusted EPS between  7 15 and  7 45  As was the case with its Q4 results  most of the growth on both the top and bottom lines in 2020 and 2021 will be due to the impact of the Celgene acquisition 
The main thing to watch with pharmaceutical stocks  though  is the progress of their pipelines  An FDA approval decision on a combo of Opdivo and Yervoy in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  is expected by March 10  2020  The FDA should announce its decision on approval of the combo as a first line therapy for non small cell lung cancer by May 15  2020 
BMS anticipates FDA approval for Celgene s ozanimod in treating multiple sclerosis by March 25  2020  It also looks for another FDA approval for Reblozyl  which was developed by Celgene and its partner Acceleron Pharma  in treating anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes  MDS  by April 4  2020  Other major approval decisions are also on the way for Celgene s cell therapies liso cel and ide cel 
Some investors were critical of BMS  decision to buy Celgene when the deal was first announced  It s clear now  though  that the big drugmaker would be in a much worse position    in the fourth quarter and beyond    without the transformative deal ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps1gb,2078163
211953,433469,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb s Earnings Get a Boost From Celgene Acquisition,news,"Fourth quarter revenue at Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  jumped 33  year over year thanks to its purchase of Celgene  which closed in the latter half of November  On a generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  basis  the company lost  0 55 per share due to the aforementioned acquisition  But on an adjusted basis  earnings were up 30  year over year to  1 22 per share  The results sent shares of Bristol Myers higher  The stock was trading up 2  at 11 16 a m  EST 
Sales of its top selling drug Eliquis  which treats blood clots  jumped 19  year over year  Cancer treatment Opdivo is still a major blockbuster with revenues topping  1 7 billion in the quarter  but its sales were down 2  year over year due to competition from Merck s Keytruda and other drugs attacking the same immunotherapy mechanism 

The big pharma plans to pay down debt to help maintain its credit rating  but noted that it still plans to increase its dividend and do additional deals    licensing or acquisitions    as well as repurchase shares  The board authorized an additional  5 billion for stock buybacks in addition to the approximately  1 billion that it had remaining under a 2016 authorization 
For this year  management expects revenue of  40 5 billion to  42 5 billion  On a GAAP basis  earnings per share are forecast to land in the  0 75 to  0 95 range as the Celgene acquisition continues to put a drag on earnings  On an adjusted basis  earnings per share are expected to be in the  6 00 to  6 20 range  up 30  at the midpoint  Management also gave adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2021  when it thinks the company will bring in  7 15 to  7 45  up almost 20  at the midpoint for guidance in both years ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps286,2078235

Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call  I am pleased to be here today to discuss the earnings results of our new company for the first time On Slide 4  let me  let me start by reminding you who the new Bristol Myers Squibb is today  Our mission hasn t changed  We are focused on discovering  developing and delivering innovative medicines that help patients living with serious diseases  We aspire to be the leading biopharma company in the industry  Our strategic foundation remains centered on combining the scale and resources of a pharma company with the agility and speed of a biotech  I am proud of the strength and talent of our people who are focused on transforming patients  lives through science Moving to Slide 5  I am more encouraged about our company s potential today than I was a year ago  The strength of our performance in  19 has positioned us very well for the future  As I look at  19 we ve delivered strong in line performance across our businesses and geographies  and we ve made important progress on our late stage pipeline  I am pleased with how integration is going so far  with good progress across our business units and functions as we remain on track to deliver  2 5 billion in synergies  Of course  we have more work to do to integrate our processes  systems and platforms  including IT pricing and accounting  Based on what I ve seen to date  I m confident about the successful integration of our company Turning to our financial outlook  I feel really good about the financial strength of the company  Our guidance reflects the earnings power and significant EPS growth outlook that we have as a company  We continue to see potential for significant cash flows to support debt reduction and continued investment in innovation  Finally  as I look forward  we have an unprecedented number of new drug launches in the near term horizon  These are all either first in class and or best in class medicines  And I am very encouraged by how prepared our teams are to maximize this launch opportunities  Now  let s move to the fourth quarter Turning to Slide 6  I ll give you my perspective  before David provides more color on product performance  We ve delivered strong growth across multiple key brands  many with double digit growth  With respect to the IO franchise  I m pleased with the excellent work of our teams in this area  Opdivo grew on a full year basis  And though  we are seeing some pressure in the US  as expected  we saw growth internationally and continue to view 2020 as a year of transition for the brand Looking forward  we have the potential for new launches  supporting an expected return to growth in 2021  This includes first line lung cancer which studies 227 and 9LA  Our first line renal cancer opportunity with 9ER and moving into earlier stage disease with a number of adjuvant opportunities  Regarding lung cancer  let me talk briefly about study 227  While we re disappointed by the position taken by the CHMP  We continue to view the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy as a differentiated regimen  with the potential for long term survival and one that should be available to patients globally Going forward  we continue to focus on the review of study 227 in the US  where it was granted priority with a PDUFA date in May as well as the filing on of 9LA in the US and globally  In summary  I am very encouraged by the strength of commercial execution across the enterprise in oncology  hematology  cardiovascular and immunoscience  This is a clear demonstration of our leading commercial capabilities  which will be important to deliver on the exciting potential near term launch opportunities ahead Now let s turn to Slide 7  In December  we attended our first medical meeting as a combined company at the American Society of Hematology  just a few weeks after we closed the Celgene transaction  Importantly  we saw very good data at ASH for our hematology pipeline including pivotal data for three products which are potentially approaching launch and encouraging data from the early pipeline  I believe that this reinforces the opportunity we have to broaden the hematology portfolio and sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma Let s turn to Slide 8  I feel good about the earnings power and growth outlook for the company moving forward  I am encouraged by the financial strength of the company this year  we see significant non GAAP EPS growth from this year into next year and we project continued non GAAP EPS growth into 2022  So  this will be moderated by the impact of generics on Revlimid  David will provide more details on this guidance but I am pleased with the strength of our in line business  our launch opportunities  our financial flexibility and the breadth of our pipeline And with respect to our launch opportunities we expect important potential milestones over just the next few months  In March  the US approval of a ozanimod in multiple sclerosis  In April  the expansion of Reblozyl in MDS  In May  the US approval of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer  Additionally  we continue to advance our regulatory filings for liso cel  ide cel and CC 486  Taken together  the company is in a strong position  And this is reflected in the performance of our business and the outlook  we are providing today Turning to Slide 9 to realize our potential  we will continue to deliver on the in line business  drive integration and synergy capture  maximize the value of our launch opportunities and advance our pipeline  Beyond this  I continue to be encouraged by our financial strength and flexibility  and now this enables us to continue to invest in innovation to deliver important medicines for patients  All of this is what gives me confidence in our near and long term opportunities as a company I m looking forward to our Investor Day  which will be held on April 2nd in New York City  When my team and I will be able to talk in greater detail about the many opportunities ahead of us  Speaking of my team  I am very pleased to be joined today by David Elkins and Nadim Ahmed  welcome to both  At this point  I will hand it over to David  our new CFO to walk you through the financials  David David Elkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Giovanni and good morning  everyone  Having benefited from working in this industry for over 20 years  I could not be more excited about the growth potential and earnings power of bringing these two companies together  I ve been very impressed by the employees of the combined company  I m encouraged by the breadth of opportunities we have ahead and our ability to deliver important new medicines to patients Now  let s turn our focus to the performance in 2019  to start the business continued to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter with 6  revenue growth on a pro forma basis  This performance serves as a strong foundation for the future outlook of the company  which we will cover in a moment  Giovanni give you some brand insights  and let me provide you with additional color on the underlying performance of the business Beginning with Opdivo on Slide 11  we had continued strong commercial excellence in the quarter  were our teams continue to operate very well and increasingly competitive markets  Let me provide you with a perspective on how we see the business at the moment  From a US demand perspective  we are seeing sequential low single digit decline driven by the headwinds we described in the past  Note that demand trends are more studies and reported sales  which were incrementally impacted by buying patterns  both in the government channel and from wholesalers Now  with respect to some key indications  we expect steady performance in our melanoma business driven by our leadership in both metastatic and adjuvant setting  In non small cell lung cancer  the size of the eligible pool of second line patients is leveling off at roughly one third and first line RCC space  We continue to perform well were Opdivo  Yervoy remains the standard of care in intermediate and poor risk patients and we ve seen stabilization in this indication as well Internationally  we ve seen very strong commercial execution in all our key markets  resulting an encouraging growth in the brand  We expect further growth as we continue to secure reimbursement in first line RCC  With respect to first line lung  We look forward to the opportunity to launch 9LA in the same setting and making Opdivo available for patients in these markets  So  stepping back  we continue to see 2020 as a transition year for Opdivo with demand pressures in the US and growth in our international business  More importantly  as we move into 2021  we believe we have a strong foundation for growth fueled by potential new indications  including first line lung Now  let s turn to Eliquis on Slide 12  In the fourth quarter  we saw continued strong sales growth of 19  globally due to increased demand in both afib and VTE  In the US  we saw 18  sales growth in the fourth quarter versus prior year  Despite increased discounts for the Medicare coverage gap Eliquis continues to increase its share at the expense of warfarin and an expanding NOAC class  As the class is expanded  we ve seen Eliquis taking share at the expense of other NOACs  Shown on this slide is the difference between new brand share and total brand share in the US for both warfarin and Eliquis  This highlights the continued growth opportunity for the class and the brand  We are also very pleased with the growth of Eliquis internationally  where we have a leading share in a growing number of markets  resulting in 21  sales growth in Q4 versus the same quarter last year  We continue to view this brand  which remains the number one NOAC globally as one positioned for significant future growth and continued opportunity for patients We also see strong growth in our multiple myeloma franchise  As you will see on Slide 13  Revlimid continue to grow in the fourth quarter driven by triplet regimens and increased treatment duration  increasing 10  year over year on a pro forma basis  Pomalyst saw significant growth of 23  in Q4 versus last year on a pro forma basis  driven by increased demand and duration of therapy  We expect growth to continue across both brands through to increase adoption of the triplet regimens and increased duration of treatment I ll now turn to Slide 14 and review our fourth quarter P L  This was an unusual quarter for the company as a result of the close of the Celgene acquisition on November 20  Included in our reported P L or the approximately six weeks of results from the legacy Celgene business post the transaction close  as it relates to the non GAAP P L  We now include the impact of stock based compensation in our operating expense  which was previously specified for Celgene when it was a stand alone company  With respect to OI E since the close of the transaction  we have incorporated both the interest expense on legacy Celgene debt and have begun recognizing interest expense on acquisition financing that had previously been specified since its issuance last May  Also  our Q4 tax rate was primarily impacted by several one time favorable items including the resolution of uncertain tax provision and provision adjustments for filings in the US and other markets Looking to 2020 from a financial perspective on Slide 15  we provided guidance reflecting the strength and momentum in the business  Our new launch products and indications and the realization of synergies  First  it s important to note that our guidance on non GAAP earnings per share reflects the expected 40  accretion to the BMS stand alone P L and includes significantly higher operating margins than in the past  Given the unique circumstances as a new company this year s guidance includes more detail than we typically provide  So  let me provide some color on the key line items  Revenue represents growth on a pro forma basis driven by opportunities we see in our prioritized portfolio  more than offsetting declines in our established brands  We expect a continued decline in established brand portfolio due to strategic course choices and competitive dynamics First  we expect Baraclude to continue to decline based on the maturity of that drug and generic competition  We expect by days it will be impacted in 2020 by generics in Europe  And we expect the rest of the established brands portfolio to decreased by about one third compared to the 2019 pro forma results  This is driven by the full year impact of the Otezla divestiture  as well as further generic erosion of the HIV portfolio OI E includes incremental interest expense offset by royalties  From an interest perspective in our non GAAP P L  interest expense will be driven by approximately  45 billion of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3 4   Note that royalties from the AstraZeneca are stepping up in 2020 and we also expect higher royalties on our PD 1 patents  altogether we expect royalties to roughly offset interest expense in the year Our separate line items for R D and SG A each include the impact of stock based compensation  as well as deal synergies  We expect to realize about one third of the total  2 5 billion synergies this year  With respect to stock based compensation BMS includes the impact of Celgene s employee stock based comp in our operating expense  which negatively impacts our non GAAP P L  The full year amount of the stock based compensation for Celgene in 2019 was roughly  800 million on a non GAAP basis  which was incremental to the BMS stand alone stock based compensation  We expect levels of stock based compensation to remain elevated in 2020 and begin to taper down over time as the Celgene and BMS legacy plans converge We also want to remind you  on Slide 16  the evolution of our share count  Basic share count as of the end of 2019 was impacted by the  715 million of new issuances as a result of the Celgene conversion and by the impact of the ASR  Going forward  our 2020 basic share count will be impacted by three factors  The number of stock options exercised  the finalization of the ASR program and additional share repurchases  which provides us flexibility to manage the potential future dilution  Remember  there will continue to be a dilutive impact for the stock options  that remain in the money  That said  no additional options will be granted under the legacy Celgene plan  so over time this impact will lessen as the compensation plans from the legacy companies converge  As you can see  we ve guided our weighted average share count for the year to be approximately 2 3 billion shares for the year Now  on Slide 17 as we look beyond 2020  we see a robust growth in 2021  driven by the current portfolio as well as new expected launch opportunities and the impact of continued synergies  all of which is reflected in the EPS guidance  We expect continued growth into 2022 while acknowledging  this will be at a moderated growth rate do the generic competition for Revlimid  It s important to mention that we do not anticipate continually updating our long term guidance throughout the year Now  let s turn to capital allocation on Slide 18  As we said in the past  we continue to expect significant cash flow from the newly combined businesses and we will continue to employ a balanced approach to capital allocation  Business development is a key enabler of our strategy and therefore remains a top capital priority  We also remain committed to the dividend  as evidenced by our 10 plus year track record of annual increases and our recent increase of almost 10  in December  At the same time  we remain fully committed to deleveraging and achieving our 1 5 times gross debt to EBITDA ratio by the close of 2023 As you are aware  we have approximately  10 billion in bonds maturing over the next three years  providing an opportunity to reduce total debt  Finally  related to share repurchases  we repurchased 105 million shares in 2019  99 million in Q4 under the  7 billion ASR  mostly due to the percent retired upfront  The remaining roughly 20  of the ASR is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 this year As we announced today  we ve increased our share repurchase authorization by  5 billion to  6 billion  This provides us with the flexibility to execute disciplined share repurchases to manage the dilution from stock based compensation and stabilizing the share count  into the next year  Other typically  we don t provide quarterly guidance  I d like to remind you of the seasonality of the legacy Celgene portfolio  specifically Revlimid revenue is historically a bit lighter in the first quarter then the full year average run rate Before we move to the question and answer session  I just wanted to reiterate that we feel really good about the growth outlook and financial flexibility of the business  and have reflected in our guidance  The company is in a strong position to embark on its next chapter and delivering important medicines for patients  I ll now turn the call back over to John and Giovanni for the question and answer John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsThanks  David  And I think we re ready to go to the Q A session Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  We take our first question from Chris Schott from J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Chris Schott    J P  Morgan    AnalystGreat  thanks so much for the questions  Maybe just two here on Opdivo  First  I know Giovanni you touched on a little bit in the prepared remarks  but can you elaborate on the first line lung strategy in Europe post the last week s 227 update  And then we think about first line lung in the US is Opdivo  Yervoy and the 227 data the primary focus or do you feel that 9LA regimen of chemo Opdivo  Yervoy will be the bigger focus  I m trying to figure out how you re balancing those I guess two data sets  And then my second question was another one  just as we think about 2020 for Opdivo  when you look at where the Street shaken out here or so things about a 5  erosion for Opdivo this year versus 2019  Do you feel like consensus properly captures the balance of the second line lung erosion relative to the growth you re seeing in some of these other indications  Thanks so much Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thank you  Chris  So first of all  let me just say  as I mentioned in my remarks  Our focus in Europe for first line lung cancer obviously has shifted to 9LA  which we believe has you know  and we ve said before is an important study  Let me just ask Chris Boerner to give you a perspective on our overall strategy for first line lung cancer in the US as we think about the two trials  and then Chris can provide some perspective on Opdivo performance and the various components of that in 2020 as well Chris Schott    J P  Morgan    AnalystYeah  Chris  Thanks for the question  I mean I think we continue to see 227 and 9LA as being bought off in the US  very much in conjunction with one another  If you go back  what we hear consistently from physicians who have seen the 227 data is that number one  they re impressed with the potential for long term survival with dual I O therapy  They note the depth and durability of complete remissions  all coming with a very manageable safety profile and so  they see that as an important opportunity for patients who either don t need or don t want to chemotherapy  And incidentally  I would say that the be NCCN listing to A listing that we got back in December is a recognition  both of the unmet need that continues to exist in first line lung cancer as well as the potential that exist for dual I O therapy  What 9LA then brings to the table is  answering the question for those patients who do need chemotherapy  does concomitant chemotherapy two cycles in this case along with dual I O therapy provide a benefit  and we re very happy to see a second study that demonstrates overall survival  So  as physicians in the US  think about these studies  they very much think about them in combination with one another and that s an important part of how we are going to think about our long term strategy in first line lung cancer As it relates to 2020 and how we think about the business  let me say  just a couple of things  first of all the business for Opdivo in the US  continues to perform in line with our expectations  In second line lung cancer eligibility is still on the order of 30  to 35   We expect that s going to flatten out around 30  this year  Our shares are holding stable in the 35  to 40  range  The business continues to be stable in metastatic melanoma  We continue to have a leadership position and adjuvant melanoma and again in first line renal our business of stable in our approved indications As we think about this year  as David mentioned  the business is going to continue to still be under pressure  As a reminder that pressure really comes from three tumors  it s second line lung cancer  where we ve talked about the dynamics there and it s small cell and head and neck and in those two tumors  it s a very similar dynamic to lung cancer where you ve seen competitive approvals in the first line impacting eligibility in the second line  but I would say  importantly  our assumption for this year is that our stair our shares in the second line setting across those tumors remained stable  it s just stable within a smaller pool of patients Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd again  as we said earlier in the remarks  Chris  but we re not commenting exactly on guidance for the growth of this year  We remain confident with growth growing into 2021 and that s our focus  particularly as it relates to preparation for launches and commercial execution John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsWe go to the next question please  Anna OperatorWe take our next question from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim  Please go ahead Seamus Fernandez    Guggenheim    AnalystWell  thanks very much  Actually  I d love to ask you guys about the Celgene portfolio a little bit  rather than focusing on the Bristol portfolio  One of the products that we learned about at ASH was the    all of the day s opportunity  I was just hoping you might be able to help put that in context  for us to help us understand what may be an under appreciated opportunity in the Bristol story and particularly something that falls outside of the CVR maybe this is a bit of a surprise upside  And then also would you update us on the CELMoD development opportunity  Maybe just put in context  where you see the CELMoD portfolio delivering the most upside as we talk to position  some of the feedback that we get is that this is a pretty straight forward opportunity for physicians to treat patients that have progressed on both Revlimid and Pomalyst  So  just love to get your thoughts on both of those opportunities  Thanks Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Seamus  Let me ask Samit to start and give you a perspective  both on CC 486 and CELMoD and Nadim will make some comments from a commercial perspective Samit Hirawat    Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Global Drug DevelopmentThank you  Thank you  Seamus for the question  I think you already teed up the overall portfolio from a  what comes from the Celgene side of things  In terms of hematology  where certainly beyond the ones that we ve already talked about from Abraxane  Phonetic  and Inrebic  CC 486 certainly adds on to that  CC 486 study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia certainly a very important data set that we presented at ASH  looking at patients with AML  who have received induction with or without consolidation chemotherapy and then achieve a complete response with or without complete recovery of the bone marrow  And what we saw with  there is of course the overall survival improvement as well as an improvement in the relapse free survival  and this is an oral agent so convenience of delivery for these patients becomes very  very important  And this is the first and only treatment that has shown a survival benefit in the maintenance setting  So  we remain excited about that and we are looking forward toward discussions with the health authority in the and the filings going forward  Of course  here we also continue to think about the overall lifecycle management plan with our portfolio and the combinations that could be available in the future As it comes to the CELMoD and then I will pass it on to Nadim to comment more on  I think CELMoDs are certainly a very  very exciting addition to the overall portfolio  And in the armamentarium that we look forward to developing in multiple myeloma  We see this as absolute necessary opportunity and one of the data set that we presented in ASCO 2019 were for CC 220 where we saw that patients who had received prior treatment with IMiD proteasome inhibitors  daratumumab  they still went on to have a response rate of 31  and these are durable responses that we saw in this late line setting  So  we have additional plans for not only CCT 220 but CC 480 which is another CELMoD looking at multiple myeloma setting and there are multitude of opportunities with our overall portfolio of cell therapies as well as the T cell engagers where we will continue to think about how to do the treatments for further improvement in the outcome of these patients where cure still does not exist  So  we will be sharing those plans in the coming months and as we look forward  But let me pass it onto Nadim to talk a little bit more from the commercial perspective Nadim Ahmed    Executive Vice President and President  HematologyThanks  Samit  And then thank you for the question  Seamus  So  if you think about front line or newly diagnosed AML across EU5 and the US  about 33 000 patients and about two thirds of those patients are eligible for intensive chemotherapy and that s the patient group that we studied and the unmet need even in newly diagnosed AML is very high  So  with the elderly patients  you have a five year survival of only about 15  and 80  of these patients will relapse within 18 months  So  to have a treatment that adds 10 months overall survival and doubles the relapse free survival is going to be really important  So  we re very excited about the opportunity in AML and I d also remind you that this gives us another opportunity to once again established the maintenance treatment paradigm in another disease after we did the same in multiple myeloma  So  we re very excited about the opportunity  So  that s CC 486 In terms of 220 and Samit covered it very well as well as 480  We are hearing the exact same thing from clinicians who have been using the drug on study  So  certainly we re seeing the CELMoDs work after our IMiDs  our in line portfolio  But I think the additional opportunity as Samit alluded to some of the lifecycle management opportunities where we then have the chance to move these treatments up earlier in the treatment sequence to displace the IMiD  So  we re very excited about that opportunity also John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsThanks  Seamus for the questions  Can we go to the next question please  Anna OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America  Please go ahead Geoff Meacham    Bank of America    AnalystJust have a couple  For David or Giovanni for 2021 guidance  I know you guys don t want to give details  but generally issue  should we assume the earnings growth will be mostly from the return to growth for IO and maybe new launches or is it more from the operational synergy side of things  And then for Nadim  what is a crowded field for BCMA targeted therapy is just curious about the status of moving bb2121 up to second line myeloma  And when you BCM modalities in your pipeline  How do you all reconcile by specifics with CAR Ts and others  Thank you Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thank you  Jeff  Let me start  Obviously when you look at 2121 as we ve  as we ve said we have an opportunity to return to growth for Opdivo  We have a number of really exciting launch opportunities and I ve mentioned several of those  And so  there is real momentum in the business  which is driven by the portfolio and how new launches come into play  That s the reason why I feel really good about the fact that the guidance we provided for  21 is driven by dynamics in the portfolio that are very encouraging for us  Of course  we will be disciplined with respect to continuing to execute on the synergies and as you know  we ve updated that we feel comfortable with the  2 5 billion  about a third will come this year and we expect about a third to come next year  But I think the growth of next year  we re really excited about the portfolio opportunity is playing out  Let me just ask Samit and Nadim to ask you to answer your second question Samit Hirawat    Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Global Drug DevelopmentThank you  Giovanni  Thanks  Jeff  for the question on the BCMA portfolio  So  from a BCMA CAR T perspective from ide cel perspective  we ve already shared some of the data last year at ASH  looking at I d said in the fourth line plus patient population where we saw a CR rate of 31  overall and we certainly excited toward continuing to expand that portfolio and toward filing of that data set itself  There are three additional studies that are currently ongoing  As you can see  on contrast gov  CARMA 2  Phonetic  is the study  I think that sort of answers your question that we are beginning to look at the second line setting  so we are looking at are using ide cel in the second line patient population  CARMA 3 is a randomized Phase 3 study looking at ide cel versus a triplet therapy for patients  the third line plus setting  And then CARMA 4 was just initiated at the end of last year  Looking at the first line patient population in a Phase 1  2 study  So  we re really excited toward looking into the outcomes of these studies and the data generation When we talk about the overall portfolio from a BCMA perspective  I think all the emerging data tells us that BCMA is absolutely an important target that we need to be able to target  attack from various modalities  whether it d be through the cell therapies that we talked about or the T cell engager that we have now shared the data from the Phase 1 study  269 and certainly looking forward to now looking at how to bring that forward as more data matures and accelerate that development plan  And then of course  we will look into our pipeline  how to combine these with  as we previously discussed with cell CELMoDs etc  But let me pass it onto Nadim to give me  give you a little bit more on that Nadim Ahmed    Executive Vice President and President  HematologySure  Thanks  Thanks  Samit  And so  one thing I will remind everyone is that once we had a good idea that BCMA was going to be a very important target for multiple myeloma  we strategically and proactively embarked on a multi modality approach to treating this disease  And our thinking there was that you have very different patient segments that can benefit from CAR T versus a T cell engage and even ADC  which we have early on in the clinic  So  as you think about the various patient segments  patient profiles and patient preferences  you can envisage where a patient has the opportunity to receive CAR T with the once  one and done treatment that allows them time very long treatment free interval  So  there is an opportunity to do that  Physicians may choose to refer the younger and fitter patients for CAR T  for example  You may have somebody who prefers to be treated closer to home for whom a T cell engager will be an ideal treatment and then both treatments work differently  For a T cell engaging you need to continue the treatment to stay on top of the disease  And with the CAR T therapy  it s a once and done treatment  So  we think there is definitely room for both and even potentially three modalities to coexist one within the same line of therapy but across also across multiple lines of therapy in exactly the same way we approached Revlimid and Pomalyst in the multiple myeloma market  So  we feel very confident that we re actually delivering on our strategy  and there is the opportunity for multiple patient segments to benefit from all these types of modalities John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsGreat  thanks  Anna  can we go to the next question please OperatorNext question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research  Please go ahead Tim Anderson    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you  A couple of questions  Originally  you guys at the time of the deal gave 2022 and 2025 guidance on revenues and net income  that has not been updated since the Otezla divestiture  And I m wondering  are you going to update that at some point or can you update that today  I guess is it will have changed And then second question is  at least for us  a black box  has been how to model Revlimid erosion at the time of the deal  you made a very clear that your internal forecasts were much more conservative and cautious on the rate of erosion of Revlimid from 2022 onwards  which was a big product  I m wondering now a year on  as you see analyst models  do you think the analyst community is appropriately modeling that erosion  Thank you Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Tim  Let me just start on both questions  and then David  can add more comments  So  first of all  with respect to guidance  I think as we said from the beginning we were not going to go back and update the S 4 from last year  As you know there have been a number of things that have happened since last year  the divestiture of Otezla as you mentioned  the divestiture of our Otezla consumer medicines business and on the other side  continued really strong performance with our in line business and significant progress with the pipeline  which obviously is a key driver of our performance in the next few years  So overall  as I mentioned  also my remarks I feel better today about where we are  Then I felt a year ago when we first announced the deal  and in the strength of our in line business and the progress made with our pipeline make me feel really good about the future and the key drivers that were behind sort of the confidence we had last year and we have today in the business Today  we provided guidance on 2020 and  21  I made some comments about our perspective on  22 and we feel pretty good about where we are  So now  with respect to with respect to Revlimid also there  there have been good developments  First of all  I would say the in line performance of the brand continues to be strong  and the teams are doing a great job of continuing to support an important franchise  I think that s important  We had two IPR decisions which were favorable to Bristol Myers Squibb  We did reach a settlement with Alvogen  which was aligned with our expectations  And I would say that  overall  we continue to see the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid as a slope that is driven by sort of all of the same assumptions that we ve discussed in the past  There has been a good development  And so  nothing has really changed there John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsTim  thanks for the questions  Anna  can we go to the next one please OperatorThe next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Terence Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for taking the questions  I was wondering  first on Opdivo  if you can give us your latest thoughts on the opportunity and adjuvant bladder following the Roche data  Just wondering if there are any notable trial design differences  You could point to  for your study versus their trial  And then on bb2121 and JCAR in the commercial ramp on the forward  Anything you guys have learned from the competitive CAR T launches that you can leverage and would you expect to have stronger launches as a result  Thank you Samit Hirawat    Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Global Drug DevelopmentSure  Thank you for the question  Terence  And as it relates to the adjuvant setting  First of all  let me start by saying that immuno oncology products are going to play a major role in the adjuvant setting  because the earlier we can utilize these treatments  It will provide an opportunity to not only shift the level of recurrence  but provide a potential for cure for these patients  And overall as we move earlier and earlier from the metastatic setting to the earlier setting  the overall plan that we have in place  we are  we feel very confident about it and non small cell lung cancer melanoma RCC gastric and of course  in bladder cancer as well there  it s no point trying to do cross trial comparisons at this point  I think we are pretty close to where we will be starting to see the data emerging  I think just to keep in mind that  the overall patient population that we ve enrolled seems very similar  And without getting into the specifics  one major differences placebo used in our trial versus observation in the other trial and the treatment duration is different  but I think we should wait for the data for it readout rather than getting into the specifics at this time  But I think Chris can give you more color on the commercial side Chris Boerner    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercialization OfficerYeah  So  let me just say something on a macro level with respect to the adjuvant programs and then I ll talk specifically about bladder  Just a reminder there as you think about the adjuvant setting  you need to think not only about the patients who are treated today  but also the potential for patients to be treated  So  what we saw when we launched IO in the adjuvant melanoma space was that you saw treatment rates increase significantly and in a number of the tumors in which we are pursuing our early stage program  you see treatment rates in the low to single digits ultimately up to potentially around 40  for some tumors  but still there is plenty of opportunity for us to not only treat patients who are being treated today but with improved therapies improve the treatment rates overall  With respect to bladder cancer specifically  this is a very large patient population  It s highly fragmented and we have importantly multiple opportunities in the muscle invasive space about 50  of those patients are getting surgery today  We have CheckMate 78  which is in the peri adjuvant setting  We are looking at the entire population with CheckMate 274 and we also have a non muscle invasive bladder program as well  So  it s an important opportunity for us  We are still very confident in the opportunity for IO in the adjuvant setting and we very much look forward to seeing the data Nadim Ahmed    Executive Vice President and President  HematologyGreat  thanks  Thanks  Chris  I ll pick up on CAR T So  I think a couple of things I would mention as you alluded to  So clearly  there have been some headwinds in the marketplace and I think about things like reimbursement access environment complexity of manufacturing also the safety profile of current agents has led to most of the administration being conducted in the inpatient setting  So  we re addressing all of those near term headwinds  So  a couple of things I would say  So  if I use just liso cel as an example  the dates we showed at ASH of the pivotal data  we are seeing a safety profile where we seeing significant reduction in the incidence and severity of CRS neurotoxicity  which we think bodes well to be able to  to give this treatment in the outpatient setting  which will allow us to expand our prescriber base  So  we re excited about that The other thing that s important to point out from a differentiation of BMS is that  we do have very deep relationships with hematologists and that includes multiple myeloma that includes lymphoma  So  our footprint out in the community will really help us to drive those referrals into the treatment sites where CAR Ts will be given as well as expand out into the community with assets like liso cel  So  from where we are looking  we think we re addressing the near term headwinds  In terms of the access environment ongoing work continues in terms of addressing the DRG issue  Great news last year that the National Coverage Determination wasn t implemented  So  that could have impacted side of care  So that s not an issue for us now  From a manufacturing capacity capability between Samit and Seattle  We feel very good about capacity at launch  And we also have longer term plans to expand our footprint to make sure we continue to have great capacity But the other final thing I would add is  we ve seen transformational data in very late stage setting  But I think the true potential of these therapies  is moving them up earlier in the treatment sequence from a long term potential perspective and you heard from Samit that we have a very aggressive lifecycle management plan for both of these assets that would allow us to unlock that long term potential for these transformational therapies John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsThanks Terence can we go to the next question please  Anna OperatorYour next question comes from Matt Phipps from William Blair  Please go ahead Matthew Phipps    William Blair    AnalystThanks for taking question  I was wondering if you could quantify the impact of buying patterns for Opdivo in the US for the quarter or do you just assume it s the difference between the 6  decline in quarter over quarter prices versus  I know you mentioned a low single digit decline in demand Chris Boerner    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercialization OfficerYeah  so  let me address that  Matt  So  as David mentioned in his prepared remarks  we saw Opdivo decline on the quarter versus same time last year about 2   And let me just characterize that  that was entirely driven by the US  which was down about 10   but virtually all of that decline year over year as a result of the dynamics  We ve been talking about quite a bit  which are the dynamics in second line lung cancer As you look on a sequential basis  the US was down roughly 6   about half of that was a result of the inventory work down with the VA  The remaining portion of that was mainly the second line eligibility issue in lung cancer  we saw a little bit of an impact in eligibility in small cell lung cancer and head and neck  But importantly  if you normalize for the VA inventory movements  What you see in both Q3 and Q4 from a demand standpoint was Opdivo was down  As David mentioned in low single digits around 2  to 3   And importantly  as we see both 2020 and 2021  the impacts that you saw in the quarter  will have no material impact on what we see for the year as a whole in 2020 and for the growth opportunities for Opdivo as we go into  we go into  21 OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen  Please go ahead Steve Scala    Cowen and Company    AnalystThank you  I have two questions  both for clarification  First Giovanni to clarify on what you said about growth in 2022  Did you say you see growth into 2022 or through 2022 although moderating  And if into  is there any scenario where earnings would be down in 2022  So that s the first question The second one is on the other income expense guidance for 2020  It appears way better than one would expect  given the financing costs  Now  you mentioned the step up in royalties on Keytruda and the AstraZeneca diabetes products in 2020  But I thought that the Keytruda royalty was flat at 6 5  through 24 and the AstraZeneca royalties are either flat or step down in 2020  So  are you saying that the royalty rates are the same  but the products will grow or something different  And I don t think there s a lot of optimism about the AstraZeneca diabetes portfolio  So  I m wondering again  is it the royalty rates are changing or the products  royalties are changing  So please clarify  Thank you Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Steve  Let me answer the first question  So  when I spoke about 2022  I m speaking about growth in 2022 moderated by in terms of the growth rate  by the potential beginning of the entrance of generics for Revlimid in 2022  So  I see at this point  our business growing in 2022 as a year with the moderation of the growth rate versus  21 driven by the dynamic I just discussed  David David Elkins    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Keytruda from a volume perspective continues to grow and AstraZeneca  the rate continues to increase  So  that is being offset by the higher interest expense as I talked about in my prepared remarks with the  45 billion of debt and average interest rate of 3 4  John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsCan we go to the  I think we have time maybe for two more questions  Anna OperatorThank you  The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead David Risinger    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks very much and congrats on the disclosures  So  starting go back on this Giovanni  but just a quick question  I think that last year you had said you expected versus sort of growth  EPS through 2025  In your prepared remarks  you mentioned  continuing growth into 2022  Could you just provide any comments beyond 2022  please  And then second  with respect to CAR T hospitals are obviously losing significant amount of money on patients who are not in clinical trials  which were paid for by manufacturers  Could you just talk about prospects for changes to Medicare reimbursement and potential changes in DRG codes in the future  Thanks so much Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSure  David  let me start and then Nadim will comment  So  let me just say  again I feel really good about where we are with our business  We discussed  very clearly in Q3  we would not update the S 4 going forward  And I m feel pretty good about having provided visibility into the next three years  which clearly demonstrate the earnings power  the growth outlook for the company  But most importantly  I feel really good about the fundamentals of the business  both in terms of the performance of the in line portfolio and the speed at which the pipeline that will drive the long term growth of the company is advancing  So  I m not going to make comments beyond 2022  but I believe I provided my perspective on where we are as a company and the real opportunity we have for the long term  Nadim Nadim Ahmed    Executive Vice President and President  HematologySure  Thanks for the question  So  I think part of the issue around the access reimbursement environment has  as I said previously  has been driven a lot by the fact that many of these treatments have been given in the inpatient setting  So one  I would say if you have a treatment that has the potential to be utilized in the outpatient setting  then you start entering into the Part B environment which is very different to the inpatient compensated DRG environments  That s one point I would make  especially as it pertains to liso cel I think in the inpatient setting  the challenge has exactly being that the capitated treatment even having said that  those things have started to improve  we sold the NTAP improved to 65  last year through CMS  I think there s been lots of talk and we have been working on a potential DRG for CAR T specifically  currently sites are having to use the DRG for stem cell transplant  which under reimburses the cost of CAR T therapy  So  there is work to do  but the two things I would leave you with is outpatient represents a discrete different opportunity  which is an affected by capitated payments  but at the same time I think CMS is working on the opportunity to come up with a specific potentially for CAR T and I think that will help reimbursement in the inpatient setting also John Elicker    Senior Vice President  Public Affairs and Investor RelationsThanks  Dave  Can we go to our last question please  Anna OperatorWe take our next question from Navin Jacob from UBS  Please go ahead Agarwal    UBS    AnalystHi  this is  Technical Issues  Agarwal  Phonetic  on behalf of Navin  So  my first question is on the CheckMate of old trial  there were some interesting data at ASCO GI recently  in first line that you see for Opdivo Cabo and Opdivo Cabo Yervoy triplet regimen  So  any comment on the data presented and potential for these two regimens in TCE  And second question is on Yervoy  so Yervoy performed better than expectations this quarter  So  the question is the impact from the uptake of Keytruda in regimen is first line RCC mostly done and should we expect more temporary erosion in US in 2020  Thank you Samit Hirawat    Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Global Drug DevelopmentYeah  in the HCC arena  our focus is primarily on the Opdivo Yervoy combination  So  beyond that  we re not looking to any expanded way of looking at it at this time  So  that s all I can share at this time from HCC perspective  But maybe Chris Chris Boerner    Executive Vice President  Chief Commercialization OfficerYeah  So  Yervoy for the quarter was flat relative to the same time last year and we did show sequential growth of around 9  versus the third quarter of 2019  And that growth was driven really by both the US as well as in ex US  We saw a bit of an uptick in the use of Opdivo plus Yervoy really across multiple tumors and the remainder of the business where we have Opdivo plus Yervoy in the market today  as well as the use of Yervoy as a monotherapy in a selected number of indications was relatively stable for the quarter  So  what we re really starting to see is the increased use of Opdivo plus Yervoy really spread across multiple tumors and that s happening  both in the US and to a lesser extent outside of the US Giovanni Caforio    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Thank you  Chris  And thanks  everyone  So before we close  I would like to thank John Elicker for extraordinary leadership of IR over many  many years  Thank you  John  Now in closing  we ve had a very successful 2019  And I m proud of the focus that our teams have had throughout a very  very busy year  We advanced our pipeline  We delivered strong commercial execution to make a difference in the lives of patients and we are very well positioned as we embark on our next chapter as a new company  Thanks  everyone John Elicker    Senior Vice President

211956,433472,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb Stock Is Too Cheap to Ignore,news,"Bristol Myers Squibb s  NYSE BMY  decision to acquire Celgene in a cash and stock transaction valued at  74 billion wasn t particularly well received  For instance  one of the company s largest institutional shareholders    Wellington Management    came out in opposition of the deal on the grounds that it put unnecessary risk on Bristol Myers  shareholders  Also  the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  expressed antitrust concerns after the acquisition was announced  Bristol Myers sold Celgene s psoriasis drug Otezla to Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  for  13 4 billion in cash to appease government regulators 
Despite all of these challenges  Bristol Myers officially closed its acquisition of Celgene on Nov  20  2019  And in its first earnings release since then  the pharma company showed just why it spent a fortune on this blockbuster deal  

Bristol Myers crushes fourth quarter estimates
During the fourth quarter  Bristol Myers reported a revenue figure of  7 9 billion  a 33  year over year increase and significantly better than the  6 14 billion analysts were expecting  Further  the company s bottom line also came out far ahead of consensus analyst estimates  Bristol Myers posted an adjusted earnings per share  EPS  figure of  1 22  easily outpacing the  0 88 analysts were looking for  During the quarter  several of the company s products had strong performances  For instance  the company s drug Eliquis    which is used to prevent blood clots in certain patients    recorded sales of  2 billion  19  higher than the year ago period 
Also  Orencia    which is used to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis    posted sales of  792 million  an 8  year over year increase  However  Bristol Myers  blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo didn t perform well  recording  1 8 billion in sales and representing a 2  decline compared to the prior year quarter  It s worth noting that Opdivo is still being evaluated for other cancers  and research firm EvaluatePharma projects that Opdivo could be one of the five best selling drugs in the world by 2024  In other words  this drug could remain a growth driver for Bristol Myers  
Through the acquisition of Celgene  Bristol Myers got its hands on such products as multiple myeloma drug Revlimid  which had sales for the third quarter of  1 3 billion  This only includes Revlimid s sales from the time of the closing of the acquisition    on Nov  20    to the end of Bristol Myers  third quarter  on Dec  31  Revlimid should make a more significant impact on the company s top line from here  
More to look forward to 
In addition to its strong financial performance  Bristol Myers boasts interesting pipeline candidates  including many of its current products that are seeking new indications  The company s drugs Empliciti and Revlimid are currently being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma  Also  Orencia is currently in phase 3 testing for the treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy  a group of conditions characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation 
Through its partnership with bluebird bio  NASDAQ BLUE   Bristol Myers is developing a drug called liso cel  which is currently in testing for several conditions  including Large B cell Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  There s also ide cel  a potential treatment for multiple myeloma  which is currently in phase 3 testing  Bristol Myers acquired the rights to liso cel and ide cel thanks to its acquisition of Celgene  and the company famously claimed that its late stage pipeline after the Celgene transaction could generate more than  15 billion in revenue  
Why you should buy now
Bristol Myers will likely continue posting strong financial results  and its pipeline boasts several promising candidates as well  What s more  the company is currently trading at just 8 8 times future earnings  and its price to earnings growth  PEG  ratio is 0 78  At these levels  investors would do well to buy shares of Bristol Myers and hold them for the long term ",2020-02-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pteka,2080823

BioMotiv and Bristol Myers have been working together for five months through a partnership to establish multiple new companies  Anteros is the first start up to emerge from the relationship 
BioMotiv will be responsible for research and development at Anteros  Once the company has a preclinical candidate  Bristol Myers will have the option to purchase Anteros at a pre specified price 

Large drug companies have been doing this type of build to buy model for a while  Biogen  Celgene    now part of Bristol Myers    and GlaxoSmithKline have all established partnerships with venture capital funds to create start ups that the drugmakers have the option to eventually acquire  Johnson   Johnson and Bayer have taken a different approach  establishing their own no strings attached incubators to help start ups grow while keeping a watchful eye on new technologies 
The model likely costs the companies more to develop individual drugs  but it reduces the risk of failure and keeps their research divisions at a manageable size  The model could also result in drugs being developed faster  A singularly focused small biotech may be more motivated to develop a candidate treatment more quickly than a larger pharmaceutical company with multiple interests ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq-d-,2075759

Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  gained nearly 13  last month  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  The trek higher capped off a solid year for the industry leader  as the pharma stock gained 23 4  in 2019  The finish was all the more impressive considering shares began the fourth quarter at a year to date loss  
There were several positive updates in December from the pipeline of Celgene  which gave investors more confidence that the acquisition will pay off  Perhaps the most noteworthy was that the U S  Food and Drug Administration abruptly abandoned plans to hold an advisory committee meeting for Reblozyl  an experimental treatment for anemia in patients with certain red blood disorders  but kept the latest application review timeline intact  

So what
Celgene and Acceleron Pharma  NASDAQ XLRN  collaborated to develop Reblozyl  an erythroid maturation agent that encourages red blood cells to fully develop  to treat anemia associated with certain blood disorders  The drug was approved in November to treat anemia in beta thalassemia patients who require blood transfusions  but the duo are looking for supplemental approvals in other blood diseases  
For example  the pair submitted a supplemental biologics license application  sBLA  for the drug to treat anemia in very low  to intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have ring sideroblasts and require blood transfusions  The FDA had previously informed the pair of its intention to hold an advisory committee meeting  which would have gathered input from stakeholders on the risks and benefits of the experimental therapy  The committee would have also voted to recommend or reject approving the drug  
Although the final decision would rest with the FDA  such meetings add another layer of uncertainty for investors  Investors ended up avoiding the ordeal altogether 
On Dec  6  the FDA informed Bristol Myers Squibb and Acceleron Pharma that the advisory committee meeting was no longer required  Even better  regulators still intend to make a decision on the sBLA by the original deadline of April 4 of this year  Investors interpreted that as a sign that approval is imminent  
Now what
While the supplemental approval for Reblozyl isn t guaranteed  analysts think the drug has peak annual sales potential of over  2 billion in a best case scenario  Hitting that mark would help to justify the acquisition of Celgene  and with the advisory committee hurdle no longer in the way  investors are one small step closer to realizing the value proposition of the combined companies ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pe1jp,2052773
211971,433487,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb s Celgene Unit Backs Out of a  55 Million Settlement,news,"Bristol Myers Squibb s  NYSE BMY  Celgene unit  which the big pharma company acquired last year  has backed out of a  55 million settlement agreement with patients and payers over claims that it unfairly thwarted generic drug competition for Thalomid and Revlimid  The patients and payers claim that Celgene blocked generic drug companies from buying the multiple myeloma medications  while also increasing the prices of the drugs 
Generic drug companies need branded medication to do comparison studies with their copycat versions  but Celgene reportedly blocked the companies from buying the drugs because the medicines are covered under a Food and Drug Administration mandated distribution program called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS   which requires pharmacists and patients to enroll in the REMS program before receiving the drugs 
The plaintiffs also claimed that Celgene tried to enforce patents that weren t valid and entered into anti competitive agreements with generic drug companies  In 2015  Celgene settled a lawsuit with generic drug maker  Natco Pharma  providing Natco with a volume limited license to sell generic Revlimid starting in March 2022 that increases in volume each year until Jan  31 2026 when Natco will be able to sell an unlimited quantity of its generic version 

In July  while Celgene was still an independent company  the biotech agreed to the  55 million class action settlement  but the agreement was predicated on the class members signing onto the lawsuit  More than 8 000 individuals and more than 800 payers    insurance companies and companies who self insure    agreed to the settlement  but 80 entities opted out  preserving their right to sue independently  which led to Bristol Myers Squibb pulling out of the lawsuit 
The lawsuit will now continue with the plaintiffs suing Celgene for  3 billion  the extra amount the plaintiffs claim they paid because generic drugs weren t available ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pg0tt,2056278

212114,433630,BMY,Special Report  After a child s dire diagnosis  hope and uncertainty at the frontiers of medicine,news,By Michele Gershberg NEW YORK  Reuters     I wish I didn t have this hand anymore   my 4 year old son said as he woke one winter morning   Why  my love    Because it s no good   he said  pulling at the nearly lifeless fingers of his left hand with its stronger partner  Already weary from fear and worry over Natan s cascade of symptoms  I was pained to hear him describe how his body was betraying him  It was March 2017  Over the previous year  the signs had mounted that something was wrong  First  Natan s voice weakened  He repeatedly fell ill with lung infections  Each passing week seemed to bring a new warning  He choked when eating or drinking  His left foot dragged  He would trip and fall at play  His eyes moved rapidly from side to side  When we spoke to our bright boy  it was harder to connect  as if a heavy fog had settled between him and the world  Now  Natan was days away from a delicate surgery to remove part of the tumor that doctors had eventually found growing  weed like  from his spinal cord  It had invaded his brainstem and beyond  slowly suffocating the nerves that control breathing  swallowing and movement  Left unchecked  it could kill him  But even if successful  the surgery would be only a stop gap measure  a starting point in a process that would propel our family to the forward edges of medical science  There  the genomics revolution  as it s known  has made it possible to understand and confront what drives some cancers and other diseases  With tissue taken from the tumor  doctors told us  they would determine whether it was caused by a rare genetic mutation  which could radically change the course of his treatment  Just a few years earlier  that course would have been grimly straightforward  more than a year of chemotherapy that might stop the tumor from growing  Patients like Natan might need to repeat this punishing treatment several times in childhood and face a life of increasing impairment as the mass robbed them of their ability to breathe or walk on their own  Now  we were told  there was a slim chance Natan could beat back the tumor by merely swallowing a pill twice a day  with few  if any  side effects  In the 15 years since scientists completed the first map of a person s genome   the sequence of DNA molecules that are the unique genetic blueprint of every individual   the process has become steadily faster and cheaper  With the information such testing yields on tumor cells  researchers are developing drugs to target  one by one  specific disease causing genetic abnormalities  prolonging and improving the lives of tens of thousands of people whose illnesses were once a death sentence  And they ve only just begun   Forty years ago  we didn t understand the cancer  and we didn t understand the drugs   said Dr Richard Schilsky  chief medical officer at the American Society of Clinical Oncology   Now we are actually able to study a patient s cancer  gain some insight into what is driving it  and in some cases  identify well established  effective therapies that can target those drivers  That s a huge difference   These advances also bring new risks to patients  already dealing with a devastating diagnosis  who may be encouraged to consider costly new treatments with little evidence of their effectiveness or safety  It is a subject of debate in the cancer community  How to temper the hope for a few against the likelihood that most patients will still not find an answer in these therapies   The majority of people do not benefit  but some do  and that s what s driving the field forward   Schilsky said  In Natan s case  we learned that in a clinical trial  one of the newer targeted therapies approved to treat aggressive adult cancers had worked wonders on a small group of children with similar slow growing tumors  If DNA sequencing turned up the relevant mutation  the experts told us  Natan would be a candidate for the drug  I was not about to unquestioningly embrace a treatment on scant evidence  and one whose long term effects weren t known  As U S  health editor for Reuters News for several years  I had worked on articles chronicling the promise and disappointments of so called precision medicine  I knew to question claims about new drugs that  melted away  tumors  The professional was now personal  so I and my equally skeptical husband set out to learn as much as we could about the options for Natan  We consulted with family and friends in the medical field and tapped referral networks in our Jewish community  We interviewed experts and read what research we could find  It was exhausting  especially on top of the emotional and physical toll of caring for a sick child  but we had no choice  Our little boy s survival was at stake  THE ILLNESS Natan was a healthy baby and toddler  active and mischievous at play with his older brother  Our only complaint was that he frequently woke during the night  but in those years  there was always a reasonable explanation  feeding  teething  growth spurts  Our first real panic struck in the spring of 2016  Natan  then 3  woke one Sunday with a runny nose  but he otherwise seemed fine  I left for the gym  Within that hour  he spiked a high fever  and when I returned  my husband was holding him over the bathroom sink  splashing cold water on his face   He went limp  like he wasn t breathing   he said   I ve called an ambulance   After a few days in hospital being treated for pneumonia  Natan bounced back  The speed of his deterioration worried us  yet it seemed similar enough to other parents  stories about scary but treatable respiratory illnesses in young children and our own preschool bouts with pneumonia and bronchitis  Soon we began to wonder why his sleep was still so disrupted  and why his voice had begun to sound soft and hoarse  The first doctor visits turned up nothing unusual  When anyone recommended more in depth tests  such as a sleep study  my husband and I  wary of unnecessary medical interventions  would ask what practical difference the information could make  Within months  it became clear that we needed more answers  When Natan returned to preschool in September  his voice was barely audible to his teachers  He would sometimes appear to choke while eating or drinking  An ear infection gave way to a sinus infection which gave way to bronchitis  When he finished a course of antibiotics  he was soon back at his pediatrician s office or the emergency room  struggling to breathe   There s no reason a neurologically normal child should sound like that   a pulmonologist said after listening to just a few breaths  From Thanksgiving on  the tests began to pile up  as did the medications Natan needed daily  The list of  complaints  on his chart grew longer after each visit  noisy breathing  sleep disorder breathing  chronic bronchitis  asthma  He was hospitalized again for pneumonia at Christmas  Nothing we were doing was making him better  and that helplessness fed our anxiety  Natan now cried many mornings before school   I m sick   he would say  even if his vital signs seemed normal  At work  I was haunted by the feeling that his teacher or babysitter would call at any minute to say he had stopped breathing  When I picked him up from class  I noticed his heavy gait  how he stumbled forward while walking  and how his eyes seemed dulled  Each new specialist brought in on Natan s case identified another symptom  now more suggestive of a neurological disorder  the rapid  involuntary eye movements  the weakness on the left side of his body  But we still had no explanation   What is the diagnosis   my husband demanded at each medical visit  THE DIAGNOSIS In late February 2017  the two of us sat in the hospital cafeteria  waiting to hear when Natan had roused from the anesthesia for an MRI scan  We tried to keep our worst fears in check   When this is over  we should take the boys to the beach for a month  It s the best medicine   my husband said  I looked at the clock  The call from the nurses  station hadn t come in  though more than enough time had passed  and I was antsy   Let s go upstairs   I said  Then my cellphone rang  It was the neurologist who ordered the MRI  The scan showed something unusual  a large  infiltrating  lesion centered in the medulla oblongata  the structure at the lower end of the brainstem that controls breathing and other involuntary functions  The thickest part was packed tightly into the cervical spine  with tentacles snaking up into the midbrain and cerebellum  which regulates balance and motor coordination   What does that mean   I asked   You need to speak to a neuro oncologist   she said  adding that she was trying to get us an appointment within a few days   There s no sign of fluid building up in the brain  so you can take your son home    Are you telling me that my son has a massive brain tumor  but should go home now   I asked  We refused to leave until someone who could interpret the scan spoke to us  An hour later  an expert on pediatric brain tumors told us Natan s lesion was probably a rare  slow growing type  appearing in about 100 cases a year in the United States  Natan may even have been born with it  and only now was it large enough to crush the nerves running through his 4 year old s brainstem  a structure about the size of an adult thumb that connects the brain and the spinal cord  These dying nerves were losing their ability to regulate Natan s walking and fine motor movements  his breathing  swallowing and sleep rhythms   At least you now have a diagnosis that explains everything   the doctor said   It can take some families much longer to arrive at this point    I WANT THIS TUMOR OUT  Like many people facing a crisis  we called on every resource we had at our disposal  We were fortunate to have access to excellent doctors and world renowned hospitals close to home  The health insurance provided through my employer covered nearly all our expenses  Two weeks after we received the diagnosis  Natan endured a six hour operation at NewYork Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center  Dr Mark Souweidane  director of pediatric neurological surgery at Weill Cornell and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  removed about 20 percent of the tumor  most of it in the cervical spine  Venturing farther into the brainstem  where the tumor was harder to distinguish from healthy tissue  would have been too dangerous  Within days  pathology tests confirmed the tumor type  a slow growing ganglioglioma  a mix of cells that include components of the central nervous system and supporting tissue  The good news was that such low grade gliomas are not malignant  meaning that unlike aggressive cancers  they do not grow rapidly and generally do not spread to other organs  In many cases  they stop growing completely when patients reach their 20s  But the large size and the location of the tumor had already significantly damaged Natan s ability to swallow and breathe  That put him at risk of inhaling fluids and small pieces of food into his airways  leading to deadly pneumonias or choking  It would take two more months to get sequencing results conducted separately by Weill Cornell and Sloan Kettering  where we sought a second confirmation of the genetic profile of the tumor  In that time  we focused on Natan s recovery from surgery  with weeks spent in hospital and an acute rehabilitation center  Removing part of the tumor helped improve some symptoms  The rapid eye movements were nearly gone  In daily therapy sessions  Natan was learning to use his left hand again and walk without stumbling  But we were noticing or confirming new problems  hearing loss  severe sleep apnea  long bouts of hiccups that are a hallmark of brainstem tumors  I tried to cling to the idea that somehow the surgery would be enough for a few months  or years  before the tumor progressed further  I even hoped that it would just stop growing on its own  as a few doctors had suggested  and feared the new surprises he would face in treatment  Even without major complications after surgery  he was fragile  physically and emotionally  My husband was uneasy about waiting to see if the tumor grew further before starting some kind of therapy   It feels like we re just sitting around waiting for a miracle to happen   he said   I want this tumor out   The sequencing confirmed that a mutation known as BRAF V600E  most often seen in adults with the deadly skin cancer melanoma  was driving Natan s tumor   I have something for you   Dr Matthias Karajannis  Sloan Kettering s chief of pediatric neuro oncology  told us when we met to review the test results  That  something  was a drug called dabrafenib  sold by  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  under the brand name Tafinlar  It has helped keep a significant percentage of melanoma patients alive after five years when used with a second drug  Mekinist  a great improvement on older therapies  Karajannis recommended that we use Tafinlar to treat Natan  While chemotherapy is the standard first treatment for low grade gliomas that cannot be removed surgically  early evidence showed the new therapy could be much more effective  In some cases  he said   the tumors just melted away   MOVING TARGETS Roche s Herceptin  or trastuzumab  introduced in 1998  was the first so called  targeted  cancer therapy  interfering with a growth promoting protein found in about 20 percent of breast cancer patients  The drug has improved overall survival rates  particularly among women with earlier stage cancers  The next big breakthrough came in 2001  with the approval of Novartis s Gleevec  or imatinib  Gleevec turned the deadly blood cancer known as chronic myelogenous leukemia  CML  into a long term  manageable illness  For nearly all CML patients  the diseased blood cells feature a fusion of two genes that are normally separate  Gleevec blocks the activity of the fused genes and leaves healthy cells untouched   a huge advance on potentially lethal chemotherapy  which is toxic to both diseased and healthy cells  With Gleevec s success  the race was on to find other targeted therapies  For each potential new drug  that meant first identifying an aberrant gene that fueled a type of cancer and then devising a drug to counteract that aberration  The reality is proving far more complex as researchers learn about the multiple influences at work in cancer cells  Many of the targeted therapies approved since Gleevec help only a small percentage of patients with any one type of cancer  and often only for a year or two before their tumor cells create new mutations to outrun the drug   There was this feeling we were going to conquer cancer with these approaches   said Dr David Hyman  chief of early drug development at Sloan Kettering  who leads research into new targeted therapies  Now the medical community has recognized that cancer  is a series of rare diseases   each with its unique biological mechanisms  Yet these new drug discoveries can be life changing for small groups of patients  The U S  Food and Drug Administration has approved more than 30 therapies that are prescribed based on genomic testing results  Most of these treatments have been introduced to the U S  market since 2012   For many patients  unfortunately  we don t find the  magic bullet   but it s also an area that s under a lot of development   Karajannis said in an interview   Just a few years ago  we had no treatment options   A study published in April in the journal JAMA Oncology estimated that 15 percent of the nearly 610 000 advanced cancer patients in the United States could be considered candidates for treatments informed by genomic sequencing  and that close to 7 percent would probably show some benefit  Pfizer s Xalkori and Roche s Alecensa  for instance  target mutations that occur in about five percent of non small cell lung cancer patients  In late November  newcomer Loxo Oncology received U S  approval for Vitrakvi  a pill shown to shrink a wide variety of tumors driven by TRK fusion  a genetic anomaly found in fewer than one percent of all cancer patients  Worldwide sales of such targeted treatments topped  28 billion last year  according to research firm GlobalData Plc  Within the small community of children with low grade gliomas  the potential for a targeted approach emerged nearly a decade ago  when two different BRAF abnormalities were identified in these tumors  The BRAF V600E mutation appears in about 10 percent of the 1 000 U S  children diagnosed with low grade gliomas each year  The research coincided with the development of Tafinlar  originally approved in 2013 for melanoma patients with the same BRAF mutation  At a medical conference in Copenhagen in October 2016  just as we began to investigate Natan s symptoms  Dr Mark Kieran  then director of the pediatric brain tumor program at Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children s Hospital  presented data on 32 children treated with Tafinlar  All the children s tumors were positive for the BRAF V600E mutation  and nearly three quarters of them saw their tumors shrink or stop growing on the drug  In two cases  the tumors disappeared  while 11 patients  tumors shrank by more than half  The side effects were relatively minor   rash  fatigue  fever  Less than a year later  we read about those results and wondered  Could that be enough proof to use on our child  THE DECISION My husband and I canvassed as many authoritative sources as possible  We specifically wanted to hear more about treating children with a diagnosis identical to Natan s  a brainstem ganglioglioma with a BRAF V600E mutation  We reached out to several leading pediatric neuro oncologists  Some had treated  or followed closely  a few dozen patients like Natan  Others had direct clinical experience with a handful  or none  They told us that chemotherapy and the new drug were both viable options  but they differed in what they emphasized  Some seemed more supportive of chemotherapy  They cited data collected over decades showing that 25 percent to 40 percent of low grade glioma patients saw their tumors stop growing after chemotherapy  which usually entailed a year or more of weekly infusions of carboplatin and vincristine  Even if the disease returned  a majority of the children survived into adulthood  the studies showed  Chemotherapy s potential side effects while a patient was in treatment were harsh  including neuropathy   nerve damage that can cause both debilitating pain and numbness   and the risk of bleeding or serious infection  But there was no cognitive or other long term damage afterward  The survival data lumped together many varieties of low grade gliomas  including tumors cured by surgical removal  Brainstem gangliogliomas like Natan s represented a very small subset  Newer research and clinical experience suggested that chemotherapy was far less effective in children with brainstem tumors  particularly those with a BRAF V600E mutation  leading to repeat treatments and worse survival rates   Do not trust this tumor   said Dr Eric Bouffet  head of neuro oncology at the Hospital for Sick Children  SickKids  in Toronto and a co author on the Tafinlar study  Bouffet was familiar with many of the low grade glioma patients in Canada  He and his colleagues continue to study their outcomes and track data from other medical centers around the world  The BRAF mutation appears to make the tumors more aggressive  Bouffet told us during a consultation by phone  He told us about children  like Natan  whose brainstem tumors caused severe sleep apnea  a sudden stop in breathing  One little boy died in his sleep before he could receive therapy  Bouffet said  Tafinlar s side effects were much milder  the specialists said  and children using the medicine weren t missing school like chemo patients  They could enjoy family vacations  But its long term safety in children was   and still is   unknown and will take years to establish  The medical literature was also scant  One of the earliest published case studies  from 2014  told the heartbreaking story of a 21 year old whose brainstem ganglioglioma had returned after multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation  leaving him in a wheelchair  His tumor shrank dramatically with Tafinlar  and he began to walk again  only to experience a fatal brain hemorrhage within weeks  His doctors questioned whether the rapid retreat of such a large tumor had contributed to the bleeding  A second report showed a hopeful outcome for an infant with a massive low grade glioma that shrank dramatically within two months of treatment  saving her life  When we consulted with Kieran on Natan s case  he recommended that we consider chemotherapy first  given its safety record  and if that failed  try Tafinlar  Prior treatment with chemotherapy had also been a requirement for enrolling children in Novartis s clinical trial  There was good reason for caution  Even when drugs are tested on hundreds of patients  safety problems can take years to identify  Now regulators are more willing to approve targeted therapies  particularly those treating advanced cancers  based on testing in smaller groups of patients  For someone with a few months to live and no other choices  the risk may be worth it  But was the trade off appropriate with a slow growing tumor  We wanted to understand why Kieran  who led the clinical trial of Tafinlar  would not recommend using it from the start  In June  as soon as we thought Natan was up for the trip  we took him to Boston  After examining our son and nearly two hours of detailed discussion  Kieran gave a nod to the new therapy  In a recent interview  he said that when we met  he had just begun discussing therapies like Novartis s Tafinlar as a first line treatment with other families  depending on the circumstances of the patient   The conversation I would have had with a family five years earlier would have been completely different   he said  There is enough data now to consider a BRAF therapy appropriate right off the bat for patients like Natan  provided that families recognize that the picture could change as more data emerges  he said  Not every patient has the luxury of waiting for that information   You can t always say  let s just wait for three years and see how the data goes   Kieran said  He recently left Dana Farber to lead pediatric cancer therapy development at Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   Through all our research and our consultations with experts  one detail stood out  There was a chance that Tafinlar would actually shrink Natan s tumor  an unlikely outcome with chemo  If it did  his symptoms could improve  assuming the nerves had not already been irreparably damaged  We needed to give him that chance  THE TREATMENT Two weeks later  a Sloan Kettering pharmacist showed me how to turn Tafinlar into a liquid for Natan to swallow safely  In our kitchen  I poured the capsule s white powder into lemonade flavored Kool Aid  which Novartis says is the only drink that can dissolve this advanced medicine  I tried hard not to spill any  Our insurance covered nearly all of the cost  but I was still keenly aware of the expense of replacing just one pill  at nearly  100 retail  In the first weeks  we kept a close watch for unusual reactions  One evening  Natan nearly passed out for no obvious reason  Another night  his temperature spiked to 105 degrees  It turned out to be a virus  For a few days  hives erupted all over his body  Again  a virus was suspected  And we noticed something else  After little more than a week  Natan s voice  nearly inaudible for months  was resonating loudly  At first we doubted that it was real  But Natan was so pleased that he could now hear himself  and talk over his brother  that he would yell and sing spontaneously  Over the summer  testing confirmed that his hearing had returned  His gait grew steadier and stronger  With a twinkle in his eye  Natan would take an extra deep breath for the nurse and watch the monitor as his oxygen levels ticked up from 99 percent to 100  He was taken off the respiratory medications and the antibiotics that had been a mainstay for nearly a year  Natan s next MRI  in October 2017  showed a result far beyond what we had allowed ourselves to hope  Nearly all his detectable tumor was gone   It looks almost like a normal brain   Karajannis said  My husband and I have asked ourselves whether we could have noticed the symptoms earlier  and whether treatment at that stage would have spared Natan from the worst of his illness  But given how quickly the science has developed  we now think the opposite is true in our case  Had we found the tumor earlier  Natan would have most likely endured chemotherapy infusions and their harsh effects every week for more than a year  with little real benefit  The success of Natan s treatment provides no guarantees  No one can say how long the medicine will work  whether he should take the drug indefinitely or stop  or whether doing either poses any risk  The science is also moving on  Novartis is beginning to test Tafinlar plus Mekinist   the combination used to treat melanoma patients   versus chemotherapy in children whose low grade gliomas exhibit BRAF V600E mutations to see if the combination works better  and longer  The drugmaker has also dropped the requirement that patients have prior treatment with chemotherapy to enroll  A new generation of BRAF therapies from companies including Array BioPharma and AstraZeneca are in clinical trials  Our hope is that if Tafinlar stops working for Natan at some point  a new therapy will be there to take its place  It s been more than a year since Natan started treatment  He began to run again  and jump  and swim  and climb  He s now in first grade  excited to get to school each day and see his friends  Natan now swallows his capsule with a sip of water  flashing a thumbs up each time  He has traveled on vacation  even overseas  without mishap  On our last trip  he picked out a new T shirt for himself  On the front  it says   Never give up     Edited by John Blanton

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Cincinnati Financial imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions

212584,434100,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Surpasses Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 22 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 88 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 94 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 38 64   A quarter ago  it was expected that this biopharmaceutical company would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of 10 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bristol Myers  which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  posted revenues of  7 95 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29 45   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 97 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Bristol Myers shares have added about 2 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 2  
What s Next for Bristol Myers 
While Bristol Myers has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Bristol Myers was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

212585,434101,BMY,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   February 07  2020,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
OceanFirst Financial  OCFC   Brinker International  EAT  and Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors

Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement

212597,434113,BMY,Analysts Estimate Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 88 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 4  
Revenues are expected to be  6 14 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bristol Myers 
For Bristol Myers  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 64  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bristol Myers will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bristol Myers would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  10 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

212614,434130,BMY,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   January 13  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
Like the majority of investors  you re most likely working on a retirement portfolio that will provide a large enough nest egg to give you a comfortable retirement  Retirement financial planners refer to this as the  accumulation phase   Your goal in this phase is to choose investments with long term growth potential   for example  a current top ranked dividend stock like Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  
But there is a second phase of retirement planning that gets less attention  even though it s the more enjoyable part  It s the  distribution phase   which simply means spending the assets you ve worked so hard to accumulate 
Planning for the distribution phase is the time where you may make decisions about where you ll want to live in retirement  whether you ll want to travel  hobbies you may pursue  and other decisions that will affect your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
Which types of accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRAs  401 k s  457 plans  and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I need to begin withdrawals  For most accounts  you should take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you turn 72  If you retire after 72  you must withdraw your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you retire 
For each subsequent year after your required beginning date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you do not have to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you paid taxes prior to contributing  Other types of Roth accounts require RMDs  However  there are ways to avoid them  For example  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What happens if I don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or not taking a large enough distribution  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year wherein she turns 72  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 72

212615,434131,BMY,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   January 13  2020,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   First Financial Corp   THFF  and Sandy Spring Bancorp  SASR  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   First Financial Corp   THFF  and Sandy Spring Bancorp  SASR  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

212627,434143,BMY,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Bristol Myers Squibb currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if BMY is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this biopharmaceutical company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For BMY  shares are up 0 99  over the past week while the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is up 0 34  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 49  compares favorably with the industry s 4 19  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb have increased 24 73  over the past quarter  and have gained 40 38  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 13 37  and 32 19   respectively 
Investors should also take note of BMY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  BMY is averaging 12 805 106 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with BMY 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost BMY s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 33 to  4 47 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line

When looking at the last two reports  this biopharmaceutical company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 10 85   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Bristol Myers was expected to post earnings of  1 06 per share  but it reported  1 17 per share instead  representing a surprise of 10 38   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 06 per share  while it actually produced  1 18 per share  a surprise of 11 32  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Bristol Myers lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Bristol Myers currently has an Earnings ESP of  34 10   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 6  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-bristolmyers-bmy-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200497029,200497029

the right stocks  which borrows from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite having potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued  and expect the price to crash In fact  overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always indicate an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue

212646,434162,BMY,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Bristol Myers  BMY  Now,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this biopharmaceutical company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Bristol Myers is 20 3   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 5  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Bristol Myers is 24 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Bristol Myers have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Bristol Myers has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Bristol Myers well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-12-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-bristolmyers-bmy-now-200494513,200494513
212647,434163,BMY,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   December 24  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Brinker International  EAT   Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  Partners LP  PSXP  and Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

The recommended approved dose of tislelizumab is 200 mg  which is to be administered intravenously every three weeks  until disease progression or intolerable toxicity

212662,434178,BMY,Here s Why Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Bristol Myers Squibb currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for BMY that show why this biopharmaceutical company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For BMY  shares are up 6 46  over the past week while the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is up 1 02  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 15  compares favorably with the industry s 5 16  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Bristol Myers Squibb have risen 25 69   and are up 24 7  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 6 23  and 24 16   respectively 
Investors should also take note of BMY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  BMY is averaging 28 426 410 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with BMY 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost BMY s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 28 to  4 47 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that BMY is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Bristol Myers Squibb on your short list ",2019-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200493154,200493154
212663,434179,BMY,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   December 19  2019,opinion,"Neglecting to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from an IRA by the due date brings about a painful tax code penalty  50   Yes  you read that right  If you are supposed to withdraw at least  4 000 and  uh oh   did not do as such  you have to write the IRS a check for  2 000 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But there is a second phase of retirement planning that gets less attention  even though it s the more enjoyable part  It s the  distribution phase   which simply means spending the assets you ve worked so hard to accumulate 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
In addition to these considerations  it is essential to take into account the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Basically  this is an IRS requirement that you withdraw a certain amount from your qualified retirement accounts once you reach age 70 1 2 
Why does the IRS require these distributions  It s straightforward   they need to ensure they get their tax  In the event that this standard didn t exist  individuals could live off other pay and never pay tax on their retirement investment returns  So  that cash could be left to family or companions as an inheritance without the IRS getting any taxes from you 
Key Facts to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 70 1 2 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  To figure out a particular RMD  you should divide your earlier year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the math  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 70 1 2  Her IRA balance toward the end of the preceding year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is the amount Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 70 1 2

212673,434189,BMY,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   December 16  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  Partners LP  PSXP   Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  and TriCo  TCBK  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors

Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

212730,434246,BMY,AVEO Pharmaceuticals  AVEO  Q3 Earnings   Revenues Top Mark,opinion,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AVEO   reported earnings of 10 cents per share in the third quarter of 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent  It also rebounded from the year ago loss of 18 cents 
The company s top line comprises collaboration and licensing revenues plus partnership royalties  Total revenues in the reported quarter were  25 7 million  up from  2 5 million in the year ago period  Revenues also comprehensively beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 million 
Shares of AVEO were up 8 8  following the company s earnings release on Nov 12  However  the stock has plunged 65  so far this year against the  increase of 1 2  

 
In August 2017  AVEO and partner EUSA Pharma received an approval from the European Commission of its VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor Fotivda  tivozanib  for the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC   It is the first approved drug in the company s portfolio  AVEO is focused on launching the medicine across Europe and other countries 
Operating Expenses
Research   development expenses were down 23 1  year over year to  4 million  However  general and administrative expenses increased 7 4  year over year to  2 9 million 
Cash Guidance
AVEO had around  57 7 million worth of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Sep 30  2019 compared with  40 2 million on June 30  2019  The company believes that this will help fund its planned operations through the second quarter of 2021 
Other Updates
In September 2019  AVEO announced  from the second prespecified analysis of overall survival  OS  in a late stage TIVO 3 study on Fotivda  This randomized  open label phase III study evaluated Fotivda for the treatment of patients with highly refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma  RCC  compared with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG s   OTC BAYRY   Nexavar  sorafenib  
These results include an OS hazard ratio of less than one that favors Fotivda 
Earlier this month  AVEO provided a regulatory update after a meeting with the FDA authorities to discuss OS results from the phase III TIVO 3 study to proceed with a New Drug Application  NDA  for Fotivda  The company plans to file an NDA for Fotivda in the first quarter of 2020 and expects to report results from the final OS analysis in June 2020 
However  during the review  if the final analysis yields an OS hazard ratio of more than 1  AVEO will withdraw its NDA for Fotivda 
Meanwhile  in September 2019  AVEO initiated enrollment in the Ib II DEDUCTIVE study evaluating Fotivda in combination with AstraZeneca s   NYSE AZN   PD L1 inhibitor Imfinzi  durvalumab  for the first line treatment of patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma  who have not received prior systemic therapy 
AVEO is also evaluating Fotivda in combination with Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   PD 1 inhibitor  Opdivo  nivolumab  in the Ib II TiNivo study for the treatment of advanced or metastatic RCC 
Apart from Fotivda  AVEO has a promising candidate  ficlatuzumab  in its pipeline  It is currently being evaluated in early mid stage studies for various oncological indications  Last week  AVEO along with partner Biodesix  Inc initiated the phase II CyFi 2 study  which evaluated ficlatuzumab in combination with high dose cytarabine versus high dose cytarabine alone in patients with relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia  AML

212731,434247,BMY,Bristol Myers Stock Pattern Triggers A 37  Surge,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  and Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  are expected to merge into a single company before the end of the year  The deal will create the fifth largest pharmaceutical company in the world with sales of approximately  42 billion in 2019 




Bristol Myers fell sharply after the deal was announced in early January  In late April  the stock was still in the doldrums and it seemed like the market does not approve the Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  deal  But a quick Elliott Wave analysis of BMY s daily chart revealed a different picture  We shared it with our readers on April 26th 
Bristol Myers was hovering below  46 a share  down from  77 in 2016  However  the structure of this decline looked like an A B C flat correction  Waves A and B were simple a b c zigzags  while wave C was shaping up as an ending diagonal pattern 




According to the theory  once a correction is over the larger trend resumes  Since Bristol Myers was clearly in an uptrend prior to July 2016  we thought  it makes sense to expect a bullish reversal  once wave 5 of C is over  As of this writing  the BMY CELG deal is still pending  but the market seems to be much more optimistic about it 
Wave 5 fell to  42 48 in July to complete the ending diagonal in wave C  Yesterday  the stock closed at  58 51 for a total gain of 37 7  in less than four months  With the bullish reversal already in place we can confirm Bristol Myers  uptrend has resumed  Of course  it won t move in a straight line  but as long as the  42 48 bottom holds investors can feel confident buying the dips ",2019-11-15,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristolmyers-stock-pattern-triggers-a-37-surge-200485553,200485553
212732,434248,BMY,Should Value Investors Buy Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Stock ,opinion,"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks  we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies  With this in mind  we are always looking at value  growth  and momentum trends to discover great companies 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is a stock many investors are watching right now  BMY is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 11 31  while its industry has an average P E of 14 75  Over the last 12 months  BMY s Forward P E has been as high as 13 54 and as low as 9 22  with a median of 10 71 
Investors will also notice that BMY has a PEG ratio of 1 14  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BMY s industry currently sports an average PEG of 1 88  Over the last 12 months  BMY s PEG has been as high as 2 48 and as low as 1 07  with a median of 2 01 
Investors should also recognize that BMY has a P B ratio of 5 37  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This company s current P B looks solid when compared to its industry s average P B of 6 40  Within the past 52 weeks  BMY s P B has been as high as 6 42 and as low as 4 33  with a median of 5 05 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  BMY has a P S ratio of 3 95  This compares to its industry s average P S of 3 99 
Finally  we should also recognize that BMY has a P CF ratio of 15 01  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  BMY s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 15 46  BMY s P CF has been as high as 42 24 and as low as 10 13  with a median of 13 30  all within the past year 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that Bristol Myers Squibb is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  BMY sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-11-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-buy-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-stock-200486106,200486106

Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well

and Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   5 High Flying Stocks That Can Scale HigherA 52 week high generally serves as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners Notably  investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs  So  one should take a more informed approach to understand if further upside is left Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite having potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always indicate an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominates the market  investors

212764,434280,BMY,Is Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  A Great Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   BMY is currently holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and a Value grade of A  The stock holds a P E ratio of 11 07  while its industry has an average P E of 14 61  Over the past year  BMY s Forward P E has been as high as 13 54 and as low as 9 22  with a median of 10 71 
We also note that BMY holds a PEG ratio of 1 11  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  BMY s industry has an average PEG of 1 75 right now  Within the past year  BMY s PEG has been as high as 2 48 and as low as 1 07  with a median of 2 01 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is BMY s P B ratio of 5 63  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  BMY s current P B looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P B of 5 66  Over the past year  BMY s P B has been as high as 6 42 and as low as 4 33  with a median of 5 14 
Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  so they are often considered a better performance indicator  BMY has a P S ratio of 3 9  This compares to its industry s average P S of 3 98 
Finally  investors should note that BMY has a P CF ratio of 13 23  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  BMY s P CF compares to its industry s average P CF of 15 02  BMY s P CF has been as high as 42 24 and as low as 10 18  with a median of 13 23  all within the past year 
Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics  but the above data helps show that Bristol Myers Squibb is likely undervalued currently  And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook  BMY sticks out at as one of the market s strongest value stocks ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-a-great-value-stock-right-now-200480743,200480743
212765,434281,BMY,BMY Or AZN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals sector have probably already heard of Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  and Astrazeneca  LON AZN   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Bristol Myers Squibb is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Astrazeneca has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that BMY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than AZN has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
BMY currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 28  while AZN has a forward P E of 27 39  We also note that BMY has a PEG ratio of 1 34  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  AZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1 61 
Another notable valuation metric for BMY is its P B ratio of 5 76  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  AZN has a P B of 9 41 
Based on these metrics and many more  BMY holds a Value grade of A  while AZN has a Value grade of C 
BMY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than AZN  so it seems like value investors will conclude that BMY is the superior option right now ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bmy-or-azn-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200480697,200480697

212767,434283,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Top Estimates,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 17 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 09 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10 38   A quarter ago  it was expected that this biopharmaceutical company would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 18  delivering a surprise of 11 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bristol Myers  which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  posted revenues of  6 01 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 54   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 69 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Bristol Myers shares have added about 9 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 5  
What s Next for Bristol Myers 
While Bristol Myers has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Bristol Myers was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 94 on  6 01 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 28 on  24 02 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals is currently in the top 39  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-q3-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates-200480798,200480798
212768,434284,BMY,Bristol Myers  BMY  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 15 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  58 22 in the previous session  Bristol Myers Squibb has gained 10 4  since the start of the year compared to the 3 2  move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 8  return for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 31  2019  Bristol Myers reported EPS of  1 17 versus consensus estimate of  1 06 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 54  
For the current fiscal year  Bristol Myers is expected to post earnings of  4 29 per share on  24 02 billion in revenues  This represents a 7 79  change in EPS on a 6 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 18 per share on  40 47 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 20 66  and 68 51   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Bristol Myers may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Bristol Myers has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 13 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 13 1X versus its peer group s average of 11 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 34  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Bristol Myers currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Bristol Myers meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Bristol Myers shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Bristol Myers Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Bristol Myers have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including GlaxoSmithKline plc  GSK   AbbVie  ABBV   and Jazz Pharmaceuticals  JAZZ   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 37  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Bristol Myers  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristolmyers-bmy-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200481511,200481511
212769,434285,BMY,Simple Secrets Anyone Can Use To Reach Early Retirement   November 01  2019,opinion,"Accomplishing the financial cushion to retire early is a fantasy for most  Bringing the fantasy to reality is not as difficult as it sounds  The key is straightforward  Save significantly more every month  Sounds simple  correct  One moment 
Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable 
A relatively new movement called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been developed around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  concept  FIRE followers develop strict savings programs  up to 75  of income  and make associated sacrifices like living in small apartments  walking to work every day  restrictive diets  and so on  This path may be too restrictive for many  but the mindset offers some takeaways that might be worth considering 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
To speed up the retirement investment cycle  you can build a portfolio structured with more risk   and the potential for higher returns  It should in any case be adequately diversified to safeguard against sharper than normal market downturns that can be hard to recuperate from and that can ruin any opportunity to achieve your early retirement goal  There are various strategies to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should be guided by your age  your risk appetite  your growth and income needs  and your long term objectives 
After accelerating your savings and setting up an ongoing plan  invest your savings into your portfolio at the earliest opportunity  Try not to attempt to time the market  Stay put  and let the compounding characteristics of the markets do its work to help grow your retirement wealth exponentially over time 
Astute investors pick retirement growth stocks with low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  Sandy Spring Bancorp  SASR   AT T  T  and Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

212777,434293,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 8  
Revenues are expected to be  5 80 billion  up 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 18  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bristol Myers 
For Bristol Myers  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 38  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Bristol Myers will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bristol Myers would post earnings of  1 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 18  delivering a surprise of  11 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bristol Myers appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200477687,200477687

Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   First Financial Corp   THFF  and Lamar Advertising  LAMR  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

212780,434296,BMY,All You Need To Know About Bristol Myers  BMY  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bristol Myers is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bristol Myers imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bristol Myers
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this biopharmaceutical company is expected to earn  4 28 per share  which is a change of 7 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bristol Myers  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
You may be able to accelerate your potential retirement earnings by consciously seeking higher returns  and also accepting more risk  in your investment portfolio  But whatever your risk tolerance  your portfolio must be diversified to protect against extreme market movements that could jeopardize your early retirement objective  You can choose from a number of ways to allocate investments to diversify your portfolio  and these should be informed by your individual goals  growth and income needs  appetite for risk  and age 
Once you ve begun saving at a higher rate and you have an investment plan  put that money to work in your plan as quickly as you can  Don t worry about finding the  perfect time  to invest   simply put the money in and keep it in  Let compounding work to help you grow your retirement savings at an exponential rate

Investors will be hoping for strength from BMY as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be October 31  2019  In that report  analysts expect BMY to post earnings of  1 05 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 3 67   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  5 83 billion  up 2 36  from the year ago period

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for BMY  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook

212815,434331,BMY,Is Bristol Myers  BMY  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this biopharmaceutical company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Bristol Myers is 19 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 7 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 8  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Bristol Myers is 24 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Bristol Myers have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Bristol Myers a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

212816,434332,BMY,Why Bristol Myers  BMY  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this biopharmaceutical company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 12   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Bristol Myers was expected to post earnings of  1 06 per share  but it reported  1 18 per share instead  representing a surprise of 11 32   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 09 per share  while it actually produced  1 10 per share  a surprise of 0 92  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Bristol Myers  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Bristol Myers has an Earnings ESP of  0 47  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 31  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric

212850,434366,BMY,Wall Street Bulls Roaring Despite Slowdown Fears  5 Top Picks,opinion,"The U S  economy has slowed  corporate profits have dwindled due to the lingering tariff war with China and global economic downturn  and the government yield curve inversion in August spread fears of an impending recession  Yet  nothing could make investors lose their appetite for risky assets like equities  Year to date  the performance on Wall Street is projecting a glorious picture with no end to the bull run in sight  at least not this year Wall Street Still Raging Forward Despite VolatilitySo far in 2019  Wall Street bulls are raging forward withstanding intermittent volatilities and fluctuations  We are in the ninth month of this year in which except for May and August  stock market returns were positive  Year to date  the three major stock indexes    the Dow  the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite    advanced 16 3   19 7  and 23 1   respectively  By any means  this performance is fabulous after a disappointing 2018 On Sep 11  the Dow surged 227 61 points or 0 9  to close at 27 137 04  marking its first six day winning streak since June  Moreover  the blue chip index posted its first closing above the psychological barrier of 27 000 for the first time since Jul 30 and is less than 1  away from its all time high recorded on Jul 16 Likewise  the S P 500 climbed 0 7  to end at 3 000 93  reflecting the benchmark index s highest close since late July  The broad market index ended in the green in five out of the last six trading sessions and is just 0 8  behind its all time high closing on Jul 26  The tech laden Nasdaq Composite soared 1 1  to finish at 8 169 67  its best close since Jul 31 In addition to the three major stock indexes  which generally track large cap stocks  the small cap specific Russell 2000 Index gained 2 1  on Sep 11 to close at 1 575 71  posting its 5 week high  So far this week  the index has jumped 4 6  and in the past month  it soared more than 5   outperforming its large cap peers Consequently  the small cap index  with disappointing performance in the last few months  successfully returned above both the 50 day and 200 day moving averages  These two key technical parameters indicate both short term support and long term potential for the index  Aside from large cap indexes  strong performance of the small cap index is vital to sustain a broad based rally Trade Tension Eases    On Sep 11  China s Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website that it will exempt some U S  products in the areas of Cancer drugs  lubricants  pesticides and shrimp meal from tariff for one year more  These products were scheduled to be under the new tariff effective next week On the other hand  President Donald Trump has tweeted that he will delay imposing 30  tariff replacing the existing 25  on  250 billion of Chinese goods from Oct 1 to Oct 15 as a  gesture of good will  after Chinese vice premier Liu He requested the same as  the People s Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary  As per POLITICO  China has expressed desire to increase imports of U S  agricultural goods if the U S  government eases business restrictions imposed on the Asian telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies and postpone escalation of tariff rate on  250 billion of Chinese goods effective Oct 1  Per the newspaper  the Trump administration is also evaluating the latest round of trade negotiations in order to consider delaying the imposition of 15  tariff on around  160 billion of Chinese goods effective Dec 15 Fed Likely to Cut Rate AgainThe market has assigned a high chance for the Fed to reduce the benchmark leading rate again in September after doing the same in July  for the first time in 11 years  Despite strong consumer spending  the U S  manufacturing sector  which accounts for 12  of the GDP  is facing weakness due to the ongoing tariff war  Business confidence has declined and inflation remains muted All these negatives are likely to compel the Fed to cut rate again this month  At present  the CME FedWatch has assigned 88 8  probability of a 25 basis point cut and 12  chance of a 50 basis point rate cut  Respondents have also assigned 48 4  chance of a third rate cut of 25 basis points in October 5 Momentum Stocks Flying High in Past One MonthWe have narrowed down our search to five such stocks

results for the second quarter of 2019 and provided an update on its business separation plan The company reported adjusted earnings of  2 53 per share in the quarter  up from the year ago quarter s  2 16  Also  the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 10 Net sales in the quarter came in at  823 3 million  down 0 2  year over year  The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  824 million Mallinckrodt s stock has gained 2  in the year so far compared with the industry s growth of 8 8  Quarter in DetailThe company now operates two reportable segments aligned to the previously announced separation   the Specialty Brands and the Specialty Generics Specialty Brands sales came in at  627 8 million  down 0 6  year over year Acthar  Mallinckrodt s largest product  generated sales of  266 4 million  down 9 1  year over year primarily due to continued reimbursement challenges impacting new and returning patients  and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending Inomax  the company s second largest product  generated sales of  139 7 million  up 6 6   driven by continued demand and contract renewals  Ofirmev sales increased 5 7  year

amounted to  195 5 million  up 0 9   driven by the recapture of market share Adjusted selling  general and administrative expenses in the quarter were  208 6 million  down from  215 8 million in the

Generics SeparationIn December 2018  the company announced that it intends to spin off the Specialty Generics business into a new company  However  based on current market conditions and developments

Generics business Guidance UpdateSpecialty Brands sales are expected to be down 5  to up 1   The company continues to expect the hospital products to collectively achieve high single digit net sales

specialty generics business overshadowed its second quarter results Shares of the company have decreased 65 7  year to date compared with the  s decline of 7 6   Mallinckrodt is currently facing multiple challenges  The company was under the scanner for the sale and marketing of opioid drugs  which contributed to the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States  The company has been in the news since the last couple of months  as there were allegations against Acthar s previous owner  Questcor  for conducting illegal sales and marketing activities related to the drug  Thereafter  it reached an agreement in principle with the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  in relation to the Questcor litigation to resolve the previously disclosed government investigation of the drug s legacy sales and marketing activities  Mallinckrodt expects to pay  15 4 million related to legacy Questcor activities  per the civil False Claims Act settlement We expect investors to focus on how the

212918,434434,BMY,Oncology Stocks To Watch Through The Second Half Of 2019,opinion,"The oncology industry is a massive and growing one  In fact  with estimates suggesting that oncology drugs will generate  120 billion in revenue annually over the next few years  it s one of the largest markets in the world  
Of course  where we find big money like this  we tend to find strong investment opportunities  Oncology companies with data readouts and regulatory updates on the horizon tend to represent the largest of these opportunities  With that said  here are what I believe to be the  that represent the largest opportunities ahead  
Exelixis  NASDAQ  EXEL   A Blockbuster Drug With Strong Potential Ahead
 Exelixis Inc   NASDAQ EXEL  is no newcomer to the oncology scene  in fact  the company won its first approval back in 2012 with Cometriq  The company s treatments act by inhibiting the production of enzymes that cause cancer tumors to grow  This approach has proven to be effective time and time again with multiple FDA approvals under the company s belt  Any FDA approval can prove to be a big win  So  the 2012 approval of Cometriq was great news  However  the drug was approved for the treatment of a rare form of thyroid cancer  and didn t yield a blockbuster opportunity  Nonetheless  the drug does add to the underlying opportunity here  In 2014  the company won FDA approval with Roche for Cotellic in combination with Zelboraf in treating advanced melanoma  In 2016  the approval was followed up with Cabometyx earning the FDA greenlight as a treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma  the most common form of kidney cancer  However  it wasn t until 2017 that the treatment was approved as a first line option for advanced RCC  This was the biggest win as of yet  leading to Cabometyx to generate 2018 sales close to  600 million  In early 2019  yet another approval came in for Cabometyx  only expanding the opportunity  The drug is now indicated as an option in previously treated liver cancer  Nonetheless  the label is likely to grow even more ahead  pointing to the real opportunity here  Cabometyx is currently being studied as a first line treatment for kidney cancer and liver cancer  Moreover  there are four other late stage clinical studies that center around the treatment across several more cancer types  Additionally  there are more than 50 phase 1 or phase 2 studies underway around the world that feature the drug  While Cabometyx is already becoming a blockbuster treatment  with all of the clinical activity around the drug  there is plenty of opportunity ahead  Investors can look forward to the publication of several data readouts  as well as new drug applications and potential regulatory approvals down the road  As a result  this is a stock that should be at the top of your watchlist 
Ziopharm Oncology  NASDAQ  ZIOP   Several Ongoing Studies Will Open The Door To OpportunityZiopharm Oncology is working to provide solutions for some of the most difficult to treat types of cancer out there  However  the company s method of action is a bit different from what we see from Exelixis and other companies that focus on more traditional cancer therapies  

Instead of starving cancer tumors of the enzymes needed for growth   ZIOPHARM Oncology  Inc  NASDAQ ZIOP  is focused on harnessing the power of the body s own immune system in an approach that has been dubbed immuno oncology  
This approach is interesting  as many believe that immuno oncology will prove to be more effective than currently approved treatments  and it is thought that by supporting the body s own immune system  there is the potential to minimize the risks of toxicity and adverse events  
Essentially  the company s drug candidates support the immune system through controlled gene expression and innovative cell engineering technologies  
Ziopharm Oncology s focus is on two clinical candidates  both with several catalystic events ahead  The first  known as AD RTS hIL 12  is the subject of one preclinical development program  three Phase 1 development programs  and one Phase 2 development program  These programs range across a variety of oncology indications  with the clinical studies showing promise  
The company is also working on a variety of Car T and TCR therapies  These therapies are involved in two preclinical and one Phase 1 development program  They are also at the center of partnerships with the National Cancer Institute and MD Anderson Cancer Institute  
Considering the multiple clinical trials underway and early promise suggested by previously announced data  there are several catalysts ahead that have the potential to yield impressive gains  So  keep a close eye on this stock  
Hemispherx Biopharma  NYSEAMERICAN  HEB   Ampligen Has Explosive Potential
Hemispherx BioPharma Inc  NYSE HEB  is also working on harnessing the body s own immune system as a way to fight various forms of cancer  The company s flagship product is known as Ampligen  and it s one that has already won approval in the world of immunology for the treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome  ME CFS  in Argentina  In fact  it is the first treatment in the world to be approved for this indication  Nonetheless  Ampligen is not a one trick pony  The treatment is being assessed as an immuno oncology option across various indications  In fact  Ampligen is being assessed as an option in ovarian  colorectal  and breast cancers  and the design of a study to treat renal cell carcinoma and melanoma is underway  As an immuno oncology option  Ampligen is believed to enable the body s immune system to fight cancer and  potentially  other ailments  For instance  by modulating a tumor s microenvironment  Ampligen may allow the immune system to target and more effectively attack cancer cells  Not only is it anticipated that the treatment may perform well as a monotherapy  it also displays synchronicities with other options  suggesting that it holds potential as a combination therapy  In fact  it is believed that Ampligen has the ability to enhance responses from immune blockade inhibitor drugs  commonly referred to as checkpoint inhibitors  At the end of the day  Hemispherx is a company that comes with incredible potential  Its candidates are being tested across a diverse line of difficult to treat cancers  With multiple clinical studies and an active search for a commercialization partner  there are several catalysts that investors have to look forward to ahead  
Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  Corporation  NASDAQ  INCY   On Its Way To LeadershipIncyte  NASDAQ INCY  Corporation is a relatively large company  With a market cap of just over  18 billion  it s no Abbvie  NYSE  ABBV   Market Cap   Nearly  110 billion   but it has the potential to become one  
The company is focused in the world of immuno oncology  Like Ziopharm Oncology and Hemispherx Biopharma  the company s candidates enlist and enable the body s own immune system to battle cancer  a method of action that Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  has shown time and time again is effective  
The company s claim to fame is a product known as Jakafi  The company s first commercial product  Jakafi is approved in the United States for patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis and for patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea  While Jakafi is already driving significant revenue  the company is working its way toward label expansions that could compound the value of the drug  
In fact  Jakafi is at the center of 12 clinical programs at Incyte  NASDAQ INCY   Moreover  the company s pipeline shows that Jakafi isn t the only trick up its sleeve  In fact  the pipeline at Incyte includes 19 clinical candidates that are designed around 17 molecular targets

212933,434449,BMY,3 Reasons Why Bristol Myers  BMY  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this biopharmaceutical company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Bristol Myers is 18 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 1 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Bristol Myers is 24 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 12 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Bristol Myers have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Bristol Myers a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

212934,434450,BMY,Is Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  we focus on our proven ranking system  which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  to find winning stocks  But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies  so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value  growth  and momentum to find strong companies for our readers 
Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today 
One stock to keep an eye on is Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   BMY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  and an A for Value  The stock holds a P E ratio of 10 06  while its industry has an average P E of 14 49  Over the past 52 weeks  BMY s Forward P E has been as high as 16 67 and as low as 9 72  with a median of 12 11 
Another valuation metric that we should highlight is BMY s P B ratio of 4 62  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  This stock s P B looks solid versus its industry s average P B of 6 93  Over the past year  BMY s P B has been as high as 8 19 and as low as 4 57  with a median of 5 88 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  BMY has a P S ratio of 3 11  This compares to its industry s average P S of 4 27 
Finally  investors should note that BMY has a P CF ratio of 12 18  This metric takes into account a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook  This stock s P CF looks attractive against its industry s average P CF of 15 36  BMY s P CF has been as high as 95 99 and as low as 12 05  with a median of 15 02  all within the past year 
These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at  but they help show that Bristol Myers Squibb is likely being undervalued right now  Considering this  as well as the strength of its earnings outlook  BMY feels like a great value stock at the moment ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-stock-undervalued-right-now-200446360,200446360

Bristol Myers shares have lost about 16 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Bristol Myers 
While Bristol Myers has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

212947,434463,BMY,Bristol Myers  BMY  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bristol Myers basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bristol Myers imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bristol Myers
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this biopharmaceutical company is expected to earn  4 18 per share  which is a change of 5  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bristol Myers  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

This biopharmaceutical company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 75  
For the most recent quarter  Bristol Myers was expected to post earnings of  1 09 per share  but it reported  1 10 per share instead  representing a surprise of 0 92   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 85 per share  while it actually produced  0 94 per share  a surprise of 10 59  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Bristol Myers lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Bristol Myers has an Earnings ESP of  0 28  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-bristolmyers-bmy-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200439831,200439831
212981,434497,BMY,AVEO Pharmaceuticals Down More Than 50  YTD  Here s Why,opinion,"Shares of AVEO Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AVEO   have plummeted 57 4  against the  growth of 6 5  in the year so far 

 
AVEO faced a major setback when it had to delay the submission of a new drug application  NDA  for its vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  TKI   Fotivda  tivozanib   for the first line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  in January  The company decided not to file an NDA in the United States after the FDA informed that it was not satisfied with the preliminary overall survival  OS  data reported along with the top line results from the TIVO 3 study announced last November 
The phase III TIVO 3 program evaluated Fotivda in highly refractory advanced or metastatic RCC patients compared with Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG s   OTC BAYRY   Nexavar  sorafenib  
AVEO has planned for an additional interim OS analysis in August 2019  results of which are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019  Based on these mature OS results  the company will decide on the NDA filing following the FDA s recommendation  Investors are keen to know the outcome of the same as a positive news might be able to pull the stock up  which has been down for a while now 
Notably  in August 2017  AVEO and its partner EUSA Pharma received approval from the European Commission for Fotivda for the first line treatment of advanced RCC  The drug is already available in Germany  Spain  Austria and the United Kingdom  The company is focused on launching the medicine across various European countries as it receives royalties from Fotivda sales in the region 
Meanwhile  AVEO is evaluating Fotivda combined with Bristol Myers    NYSE BMY   Opdivo  an immune checkpoint PD 1 inhibitor  in a phase II study for the treatment of advanced RCC  The company is also examining the drug in a phase I II probe coupled with AstraZeneca s   NYSE AZN   Imfinzi for treating first line hepatocellular carcinoma 
Apart from Fotivda  AVEO has a promising candidate  ficlatuzumab  in its pipeline  The candidate is currently being evaluated in early mid stage studies for various oncological indications  In April  the company along with partner Biodesix  Inc  announced positive results from the phase Ib expansion cohort of ficlatuzumab combined with cytarabine in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia  AML  
The company is also developing ficlatuzumab in combination with Lilly s Erbitux in a phase II probe for treating metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  The candidate is also being evaluated in combination with nab paclitaxel and gemcitabine for treating pancreatic cancer 
We believe the timely approval of Fotivda in the United States would have provided a huge boost to AVEO as the RCC market holds great potential  However  the string of setbacks the company is facing of late is a woe 
Moreover  the company is heavily dependent on its partners for the development and commercialization of its pipeline candidates  Failure to receive regulatory approvals or the termination of a deal from any of the partners would severely dent the company s future prospects

212983,434499,BMY,Targovax  Full Focus On ONCOS Platform And Fresh Data,opinion,"Targovax  LON 0RIS  recently announced a strategic decision to focus on the clinical development of its ONCOS programmes and to discontinue clinical development of its TG platform  citing the need to reallocate resources as the main reason  The news was followed by the release of interim data from the Phase I melanoma study  which was encouraging  After the latest events we have removed TG02 colorectal cancer asset from our model  although out licensing is still a possibility  and increased the likelihood of success from ONCOS 102 in melanoma  Our Targovax valuation is lower at NOK1 2bn or NOK18 9 share  vs NOK1 46bn or NOK27 7 share before  Our new  more detailed look into the investigator led trials with ONCOS 102 reveals the potential for oncolytic virus platform expansion not yet reflected in our rNPV model 


Exclusively focusing on ONCOS development
The company has announced that clinical development of the TG platform is being halted  including TG02 development in colorectal cancer  The company believes that despite the positive final three year overall survival results from the Phase I II study with TG01 in pancreatic cancer  the next step in this programme would be a large randomised  however  this is too costly for a small biotech company  Instead  Targovax will focus on its oncolytic virus platform  which it perceives to be in a leading position within mesothelioma and  overall  a programme with interesting data readouts in the near future  Recent M A activity in the oncolytic virus space  Exhibit 2  suggests this could be the more attractive technology for partners 
Data from Part 1 Phase I melanoma study
Targovax announced ORR and immune activation data from the Part 1 of the ONCOS 102 Phase I study with patients with advanced  unresectable melanoma  who progressed on anti PD1 treatment  Patients received ONCOS 102 injections and were again treated with the anti PD1 Keytruda  Three of nine patients demonstrated an ORR of 33   while immunogenicity and tumour biopsy results showed that ONCOS 102 was capable of inducing a cancer specific response and that the intratumoural injection can translate into a systemic response 
Valuation  NOK1 20bn or NOK18 9 share
Our Targovax valuation is NOK1 20bn or NOK18 9 share compared to NOK1 46bn or NOK27 7 share  This was mainly the result of removing the TG02 colorectal cancer asset from our model  which was partially offset by the increased ONCOS 102 success probability in melanoma  The dilution from the recent fundraise results in a relatively larger decrease in our valuation per share 

Business description
Targovax is an immuno oncology company headquartered in Oslo  Norway  with an oncolytic virus platform ONCOS  ONCOS 102 is currently prioritised in several indications including mesothelioma and melanoma  Targovax is also working on next generation oncolytic viruses in its preclinical R D pipeline 
Targeting collaborations for TG platform with promising final Phase I II data in pancreatic cancer
Three year data from the TG01 Phase I II trial in resected pancreatic cancer  n 32  was recently announced  showing a median overall survival of 33 3 months and a three year survival rate of 38   Two year data was released on 24 May 2018  see our note   and showed a two year overall survival rate of 68 4  in the first cohort  13 19   and 77  in the second cohort  10 13  
As we described  these results compare well with historical comparisons  However  citing the fact that further development of the TG platform would be too costly  Targovax has decided to fully focus on its oncolytic virus platform  Management still expects to extract some value from the TG platform  for example out licensing the technology  Targovax has already done this to some extent  for example  it has set up a collaboration with the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the Cancer Research Institute relating to the TG platform  and Zelluna Immunotherapy acquired a freedom to operate licence to Targovax s mutant RAS T cell receptor technology  The potential value of the deal with Zelluna is NOK100m in milestones and annual fees  in addition to royalties and sub licensing revenues 
Several readouts in the near term with ONCOS
Targovax has focused its resources on clinical development of ONCOS 102 in mesothelioma and melanoma  as well as the preclinical ONCOS assets  There are now four ongoing clinical trials with ONCOS  including collaborator sponsored trials  
Fresh data from the Phase I melanoma study  Part 1 
As expected  Targovax has announced the overall response rate and immune activation data from the Part 1 of the Phase I study with patients with advanced  unresectable  anti PD1 refractory melanoma  n 9   The trial is testing ONCOS 102 in combination with checkpoint inhibitor  CPI  pembrolizumab  Keytruda  Merck   Co   The patients  who were treated with CPIs before and then relapsed  were given three intratumoural injections of ONCOS 102 and then received up to eight infusions of Keytruda  The results include 
The treatment was reported as well tolerated 
3 9 patients demonstrated clinical response  ie a 33  overall response rate  RECIST1 1 and irRECIST  
one patient had a completed response  two patients had partial responses 
Immunogenicity data showed that ONCOS 102 induces a cancer specific response with systemic increases in pro inflammatory cytokines observed in all nine patients 
Tumour biopsies showed increased infiltration of CD8  T cells in eight of nine patients 
Cases of increased T cell infiltration into lesions not injected with ONCOS 102 were also observed indicating an abscopal effect  In addition  T cells recognising specific tumour antigens were found in circulation in four patients  Together these findings suggest that the intratumoural injection of ONCOS 102 can cause systemic anti tumour immune responses 
The rationale of the study was to prime the immune system with a virus to generate a cancer specific response and then  release the brakes  with checkpoint inhibitors  The initial data look promising  in our view  and support the hypothesis of the trial  In total  33  of patients  3 9  who relapsed after checkpoint inhibitor treatment responded to it again after being treated with ONCOS 102  These were a hard to treat patient population and  if such results were confirmed in a large randomised trial  it would be perceived as very strong 
In our initiation report  we described Australian biotech Viralytics as peer to Targovax  Viralytics developed Cavatak  a wild type oncolytic coxsackievirus A21  In February 2018  Merck   Co acquired Viralytics for A 502m  Before that the company published interim results from several Phase I trials  Interim data from one Phase Ib study where melanoma patients were treated with Cavatak and Yervoy  ipilimumab  anti  CTLA 4  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   showed that ORR was 29   2 7  in patients who had failed prior single line anti PD1 L1 checkpoint therapy  The comparison is somewhat limited by the fact that Yervoy is an anti CTLA 4 antibody  however  still same class of immunotherapy  Another biotech company Checkmate Pharmaceuticals is developing TLR 9 agonist  which is a class of immunotherapy drugs that are also being tested in combinations with CPIs  Toll like receptors or TLRs are activated downstream upon infection of tumour cells with oncolytic viruses  Checkmate Pharmaceuticals is conducting a Phase Ib study of intratumoral administration of their lead product CMP 001 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma who are anti PD1 refractory  Interim data  not complete  published include an ORR rate of 22   15 69  
Due to the small number of patients  definitive conclusions or comparisons between the ONCOS and other trials cannot be made as this time  but the Targovax data seems encouraging at the moment  Part 2 of the trial is currently enrolling patients  where the safety and efficacy of a prolonged  more intensive treatment regimen of 12 ONCOS 102 injections will be evaluated 
Phase Ib II mesothelioma study
The ONCOS 102 Phase Ib II mesothelioma study is now fully enrolled  n 31  with results expected in around new year 2020  This is the most advanced indication currently and a significant catalyst for the share price  The results from the safety part of the Phase Ib were already reported  as described in our June 2018 note  which also included initial efficacy results  The randomised Phase II part of the trial finished enrolling all patients and the goal is to assess safety and tolerability  immunological activation and the six month overall response rate  ORR  of the combination of ONCOS 102 and standard of care chemotherapy  pemetrexed and cisplatin  compared to standard of care chemotherapy alone 
Preclinical study shows ONCOS abscopal effect
Recently Targovax published results from a preclinical study that demonstrated an abscopal effect  reducing the size of tumours situated away from the injected site  with an ONCOS 102 and Keytruda combination in a humanised mouse melanoma model  The significance of these findings comes from the fact that oncolytic viruses are not suitable for systemic administration  If an abscopal effect is proven in humans  even non injected tumour lesions can be expected to be controlled  for example if they are inaccessible for injection  

M A activity in the oncolytic virus space
In general  oncolytic viruses are generating more interest in treating cancers and  as immune primers  are increasingly being explored as compatible combination partners for immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors  priming the immune system with a cancer specific response using the virus  and then  releasing the brakes  from the T cells to attack the tumour   The field of oncolytic viruses saw an uptick in M A activity in 2018  In May 2018  Janssen agreed to pay  140m upfront to acquire private company BeneVir Biopharm  which is developing oncolytic viruses to treat solid tumours based on its T Stealth platform  currently in preclinical stage  In February 2018  Merck   Co announced its acquisition of Viralytics with the lead product  Cavatak  Merck   Co agreed to pay A 502m  which was in line with our valuation of Viralytics of A 469m  published in December 2017  plus a A 29 6m placement by Viralytics  in January 2018   This represented a 178  premium to Viralytics  prior day closing share price  In our view  these deals confirm interest in the technology field  and in the application to solid tumour therapy 

Investigator led trial outcomes could translate into new commercial opportunities
In light of the recent move to focus on ONCOS  we have re examined the collaborator trials  summarised in Exhibit 3  in more detail to evaluate the potential in these indications 

The Phase I II trial in collaboration with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and the Cancer Research Institute is being conducted in patients with peritoneal disease who have failed prior standard chemotherapy and have histologic confirmation of epithelial ovarian cancer or metastatic colorectal cancer  CRC   ONCOS 102 is being studied in combination with MedImmune s checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab  In our view  this collaboration is the most likely of the two ONCOS 102 collaborations to translate into a commercial opportunity in the near term for several reasons 
Area of unmet need  these patients have a poor prognosis and are very difficult to treat 
It is a fairly large trial for Phase I II  n 78  
The study is being conducted by high profile research institutions in the US 
There is a strong scientific rationale for combining an oncolytic virus eg ONCOS 102 and a checkpoint inhibitor eg durvalumab  as discussed in our initiation report   and Targovax is already exploring this combination in its Phase I melanoma study   Keytruda 
The ONCOS 102 administration route is intraperitoneal  Patients with peritoneal metastasis can be uniquely treated with peritoneal chemotherapy and since ONCOS 102 is administered locally  there is a strong rationale for intraperitoneal administration 
The peritoneum is a tissue  membrane  that lines organs in the abdominal cavity  Due to its proximity to several other organs  a primary tumour in these organs can easily metastasise to the peritoneum  Primary tumours can also originate in the peritoneum  but this is very rare  Colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer are common primary tumours that are known to metastasise to the peritoneum  Although survival rates have improved somewhat with the introduction of new treatments  the prognosis of these patients is still very poor due to the advanced stage  Specific treatments for peritoneal metastases are cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy  but patients will likely be receiving additional treatments for their primary tumours 
Potentially large patient population
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer  making up around 90  of cases  cancer org   The majority of patients who are diagnosed have advanced disease  around 87   Narod  2016   where the tumour has spread beyond the pelvic tissues  for example to the lymph nodes or peritoneum  stage III   or further to liver or spleen parenchyma  stage IV   Most patients with advanced disease have peritoneal metastases  one study found this to be 76  of patients   and it is ultimately regarded as part of the disease 
Colorectal peritoneal metastases are not as common as in ovarian cancer  Around 16  of metastatic colorectal cancer cases have peritoneal metastases  Treatment with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy can improve survival from around five months  untreated  to 12 18 months  Koumpa et al  2019  
Given the early stage of the study  it is too early to estimate the potential precise positioning of ONCOS 102 for treatment of patients with peritoneal metastasis  but our initial evaluation reveals a relatively large accessible patient population given the rather specific peritoneal chemotherapy approach  Exhibit 4   We estimate that the number of patients with advanced ovarian cancer having peritoneal metastases to be around 13k in US and 19k in Europe  Applying the same pricing as we have done for ONCOS 102 in other indications   75k in US and  52 5k in Europe  would indicate a potential market of  1bn in the US and the same in Europe  assuming 100  penetration   We estimate the number of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases to be lower  around 4k in the US and 5k in Europe  which would translate into an addressable market of around  300m in US and the same in Europe 

Collaborator Medimmune  AstraZeneca  is already active in the ovarian cancer space with its marketed PARP inhibitor Lynparza  but is not currently in the colorectal cancer space  Durvalumab  Imfinzi  is not yet approved in ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer but is approved in several other cancers  including bladder cancer  head and neck  liver cancer  melanoma  non small cell lung and small cell lung cancers  
Valuation
Our updated valuation is NOK1 20bn or NOK18 9 share  compared to NOK1 46bn or NOK27 7 share previously  which is based on a risk adjusted NPV analysis using a 12 5  discount rate  including NOK166 8m net cash  The dilution from the recent fundraise was the main reason for the relatively larger decrease in our valuation per share  We now include NOK6 0m in financial leases as required under IFRS 16  We continue to exclude from our valuation other long term debt of NOK53 1m in Finnish government grants  as repayment is needed only if the products are sold or launched 
We have previously removed the pancreatic cancer indication  Now we have also removed the TG02 colorectal cancer asset from our model  as a result of the recent strategic decision regarding the TG platform  TG02 was being explored in a Phase Ib trial where colorectal patients received TG02 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor  Targovax stopped the trial without waiting for the data  but as this was mainly a safety and immunogenicity study  the immediate termination of the trial is rational  in our view  from an R D portfolio management perspective  In our last report  this indication had a value of NOK9 2 share  out of the total rNPV of NOK27 7 share   This removal was partially offset by the increase in success probability of ONCOS 102 in melanoma from 10  to 15  following the interim data announcement 
We keep other assumptions relating to the clinical trials in our rNPV model unchanged  described in our initiation report   For the time being we do not include in our valuation the potential of ONCOS 102 in the indications being explored by the partners  peritoneal metastasis or prostate cancer   This is mainly because these trials are still being led by the partners and Targovax cannot control the trial design  Depending on the results  multiple outcomes are possible  such as advanced stage trials  which could lead to a formal licensing deal or Targovax itself could decide to invest in these indications  We will revisit these programs once more details are revealed 
Upcoming near term catalysts are 
Preclinical data on new ONCOS oncolytic viruses expected H219  and
ONCOS 102 mesothelioma Phase I interim data expected in Q120 

Financials
As Targovax s Q119 results were in line with our expectations  and we made no major changes to our estimates  The Q119 operating loss was NOK39 6m with external R D expenses accounting for NOK19 4m  The company is stopping all clinical R D activities for its TG platform  but we expect it will increase clinical activities for ONCOS so we leave the total operating loss estimate for 2019 unchanged at NOK140m 
The cash position of NOK172m gross at end Q119 plus NOK1 0m gross from a subsequent repair offering should reach well into 2020  which is in line with Targovax s guidance  Q320   According to management  there was strong interest from existing shareholders and new institutional investors  in Norway and the US  in the private placement that Targovax undertook in March 2019 
As the R D pipeline matures  several projects should reach mid stage around 2021  which is when we expect another substantial increase in R D spend  The required additional funding for 2020 is reflected in our model as a long term debt of NOK51m  as per our research principles 
Targovax has changed the way it accounts for leases under the new IFRS 16 rules  It now records remaining financial leases  excluding short term leases of less than 12 months and low value leases  in the balance sheet as long term liabilities  SEK5 9m as of end Q119   This was balanced with a corresponding increase in long term assets  The net effect on the P L was minor ",2019-07-11,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/targovax-full-focus-on-oncos-platform-and-fresh-data-200438737,200438737

213003,434519,BMY,Bristol Myers  BMY  Upgraded To Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bristol Myers basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Bristol Myers  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bristol Myers
This biopharmaceutical company is expected to earn  4 21 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 5 8  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bristol Myers  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

213014,434530,BMY,Insys Down On Bankruptcy News Amid Increasing Legal Expenses,opinion,"Shares of Insys Therapeutics   NASDAQ INSY   have plummeted 51 4   after it filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U S  Bankruptcy Code in the U S  Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware Insys Therapeutics  Inc  Price
 

 
   The protection will enable the company to facilitate the sale of substantially all of its assets and address its legacy legal liabilities 
Insys has been embroiled in various litigations in recent times amid allegations of fuelling the ongoing opioid endemic in the United States  The company has also been accused of bribing doctors to prescribe its lead drug  Subsys  to patients     
Subsys is a proprietary sublingual fentanyl spray indicated for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients aged 18 years or older  who are already receiving and are tolerant to around the clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
The company has experienced recurring and increasing losses from operations over the last 18 months due to significant declines in the Transmucosal immediate release fentanyl  TIRF  market  and considerable legal expenses resulting from the DOJ Investigation and other significant litigation matters  The company had earlier stated of a possible bankruptcy given its limited cash balance

213015,434531,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Bristol Myers Squibb in Focus
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of  9 83  since the start of the year  The biopharmaceutical company is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 41 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 5   This compares to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 3 04  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 96  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 64 is up 2 5  from last year  Bristol Myers Squibb has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 2 49   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Bristol Myers s payout ratio is 40   which means it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BMY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 18 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 5 03  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that BMY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200431007,200431007

213063,434579,BMY,Roche Gets FDA Nod For Venclexta Plus Gazyva To Treat CLL,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental new drug application  sNDA  for Venclexta  venetoclax  in combination with Gazyva  obinutuzumab   The company is a seeking label expansion of the drug for the first line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL  or small lymphocytic lymphoma  SLL  
The nod was based on data from the phase III CLL14 study  which compared Venclexta   Gazyva with Gazyva   chlorambucil  Results from the program showed that Venclexta   Gazyva demonstrated a durable and significant reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death by 67  as compared to Gazyva   chlorambucil  a current standard of care 
Roche plans to present the study outcomes at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting to be held in June 2019 
Venclexta is co developed by AbbVie   NYSE ABBV   and Genetech  a unit of Roche  Both Roche and AbbVie co commercialize the product in the United States while the latter exclusively commercializes the same in ex U S  markets 
The FDA reviewed and approved the sNDA under its Real Time Oncology Review  RTOR  and Assessment Aid pilot programs  Previously  the regulatory agency had granted Venclexta a Breakthrough Therapy Designation in combination with Gazyva for the treatment of previously untreated CLL with co existing medical conditions 
Notably  last September  the FDA approved the label expansion of Venclexta in combination with Rituxan to include minimal residual disease  MRD  negativity data from the phase III MURANO study 
The investigation evaluated the combo regimen for relapse refractory CLL patients  having received at least one prior therapy as compared to Teva Pharmaceuticals    NYSE TEVA   Treanda  bendamustine  plus Rituxan 
These label expansions of the drug will help it gain an access to a broader patient population and should drive sales in the future 
Shares of Roche have increased 4 9  so far this year versus the  decrease of 1 1  

 
In a separate press release  Roche announced positive findings from the phase I II STARTRK NG probe  which evaluated its investigational medicine  entrectinib  for treating children and adolescents with recurrent or refractory solid tumors with and without neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase  NTRK   ROS1 or anaplastic lymphoma kinase  ALK  gene fusions 
Data from this analysis showed that entrectinib shrank tumors in all the 11 patients  who had NTRK  ROS1 or ALK fusion positive solid tumors including two patients achieving a complete response  The company plans to update the details at the annual meeting of American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago come Jun 2  2019

213064,434580,BMY,Mallinckrodt  MNK  Down After Filing Suit Against HHS And CMS ,opinion,"Shares of Mallinckrodt plc   NYSE MNK   crashed 24 2  after the company filed suit in federal district court against the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  to protect Medicaid patient access to Acthar 
The lawsuit was filed against the agency s decision  which required Mallinckrodt to change the base date average manufacturer price  AMP  used to calculate Medicaid drug rebates for Acthar  
Through the lawsuit  the company challenges CMS  unexplained and unlawful reversal of its repeated 2012 written authorizations on calculation of Medicaid rebates for Acthar 
The company has decided to seek court intervention to ensure that CMS follows Administrative Procedure Act and other legal requirements  after repeated failed attempts to solve the matter through discussions 
Acthar Gel  which became part of the company s portfolio following the Questcor acquisition  is currently approved for 19 indications  It is the lead drug in Mallinckrodt s portfolio 
Per Mallinckrodt  the attempted reversal  which CMS seeks unlawfully to make retroactive  would substantially eliminate Medicaid net sales of Acthar Gel 
If the court doesn t intervene  Mallinckrodt would lose Medicaid net sales for Acthar Gel  which currently contributes 10  to total Acthar sales  This in turn also jeopardizes the company s annual guidance of raking in more than  1 billion of Acthar sales in 2019  with the potential for retroactive non recurring charges going up to  600 million 
We remind investors that Mallinckrodt was in the news last month as there were allegations against Acthar s previous owner  Questcor  for conducting illegal sales and marketing activities related to Acthar  Per the company  the original action was filed in 2012  prior to Mallinckrodt s ownership of Acthar Gel  and consist of two complaints filed by former Questcor employees 
The U S   Department of Justice  DOJ  elected to join an existing civil False Claims Act case against the company  However  since these allegations were made prior to Mallinckrodt s acquisition of Acthar Gel  the company does not expect any impact on its business today due to these 
Mallinckrodt s stock has plunged 37 5  in the year so far compared with the  s decline of 4 6  

 
Acthar generated sales of  223 9 million in the first quarter  We expect the lawsuit to weigh on shares until resolved

213077,434593,BMY,Why Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Bristol Myers Squibb in Focus
Based in New York  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is in the Medical sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of  8 71   Currently paying a dividend of  0 41 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 46   In comparison  the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield is 2 88   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 94  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 64 is up 2 5  from last year  In the past five year period  Bristol Myers Squibb has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 2 49   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Bristol Myers s current payout ratio is 40   meaning it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BMY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 18 per share  with earnings expected to increase 5 03  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that BMY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-05-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200419496,200419496
213078,434594,BMY,Bristol Myers  BMY  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this biopharmaceutical company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth

While the historical EPS growth rate for Bristol Myers is 18 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 5  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 0 9  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Bristol Myers is 24 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Bristol Myers have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Bristol Myers a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

213096,434612,BMY,Bristol Myers  Elliott Wave Setup Can Double The Price,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  is in the process of acquiring Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  in a  74 billion dollar cash and stock deal including debt  The deal faced opposition from hedge funds Wellington Management and Starboard Value  but ultimately gained shareholder approval on April 12th 
Arbitrageurs  who aim to profit from the discrepancy between the market price and the deal closing price  seem to have shorted BMY stock as a hedge  in order to protect their returns  The stock is set to open at  45 64 today  down from  54 38 in early March  In reality  BMY stock has been under pressure since July 2016  when it reached an all time high of  77 12 a share 
The acquisition is expected to close in Q3 2019  From then on  management will have to deal with shareholder dilution  debt reduction and the integration of Celgene into Bristol Myers  Despite the high quality of Celgene s business  risks for long term BMY investors have increased significantly  A lot can go wrong  but the actual outcome   positive or negative   will remain unknown for some time 
Bristol Myers  A Pattern Has Emerged
Fortunately  we can look at the situation from another angle  It looks like all the news around BMY stock in the last three years  all the earnings reports  drug successes and failures  analysts  upgrades and downgrades led to the formation of a recognizable Elliott Wave pattern  Take a look at it on the daily price chart of Bristol Myers Squibb below 

The daily chart reveals that the entire decline from  77 12 can be seen as an A B C flat correction  Waves A and B are simple a b c zigzags  while wave C appears to be an ending diagonal 
Prior to this retracement  BMY stock was in an uptrend  According to the Wave theory  once a correction is over the larger trend resumes  If we apply this here  it makes sense to expect a bullish reversal as wave 5 of C is poised to complete the entire pattern soon 
Despite all the risks  the market seems ready to give the BMY Celgene deal its vote of confidence  The anticipated rally is supposed to regain all the value lost since July 2016  If this count is correct  a revisit of  77 a share is quite possible  Once there   90 will not be too far away

213097,434613,BMY,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Bristol Myers  BMY ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this biopharmaceutical company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Bristol Myers is 17 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 1 2  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Bristol Myers is 24 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13 6  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Bristol Myers  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Bristol Myers has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

213108,434624,BMY,Bristol Myers  BMY  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Bristol Myers basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Bristol Myers imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Bristol Myers
This biopharmaceutical company is expected to earn  4 16 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 4 5  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Bristol Myers  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

213119,434635,BMY,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Bristol Myers  BMY ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this biopharmaceutical company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 15 18   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Bristol Myers came out with earnings of  0 94 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 per share  representing a surprise of 10 59   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 91 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 09 per share  delivering a surprise of 19 78  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Bristol Myers  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Bristol Myers currently has an Earnings ESP of  6 54   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 25  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-bristolmyers-bmy-200404812,200404812

213151,434667,BMY,Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry Outlook  A Recovery Ahead ,opinion,"The Zacks industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas such as neuroscience  cardiovascular and metabolism  rare diseases immunology and oncology  Some of these companies also make vaccines  animal health  medical devices and consumer related healthcare products  All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already marketed drugs  
Here are the industry s three major themes Demand driven growth in sales of new products  successful innovation and product line expansion  strong clinical study results  frequent FDA approvals  continued strong performance of key products  growing demand for drugs  especially for rare to treat diseases  an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors boosting this industry s growth  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations  which are escalating costs and slowing down innovation  are the other positives  Mergers and acquisitions  M A  activity is increasing following the tax reform  Big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines technology  Meanwhile  in licensing deals continue to be popular with several big companies collaborating with smaller and mid sized players on promising mid to late stage pipeline candidates or interesting technology  These deals make sense for both larger and smaller companies  While the big shots are able to improve their pipelines with prospective candidates  the smaller entities gain access to a non dilutive source of funds that allows consistent investment in the pipelines  Headwinds for the industry include government scrutiny of high drug prices  pricing pressure  intensifying branded competition  rising rivalry from biosimilar and generic products  a slowdown in growth of legacy products and major pipeline setbacks  Overall  we believe that pipeline success  cost cutting measures  share buybacks  product launches  ramped up M A and collaboration activities should keep the sector afloat  going forward

Bottom Line
In order to succeed in a changing global market and evolv ing healthcare landscape  pharma ceutical companies need to adopt innovative business models  invest in new technologies  raise investments in personalized medicines and seek external partners and collabora tors for complementary strengths 
The sector may face some volatility due to the drug pricing issue  pricing re imbursement pressure  stiff competition  sluggish legacy product sales  loss of patent exclusivity of some key drugs and pipeline related setbacks  Also the fourth quarter results were mostly below expectations and the earnings and sales outlook for 2019 was rather soft 
However  pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas  cost controlling  share repurchases  product introductions  heightened M A activity and appropriate utilization of cash should put the sector on a firm footing as the year progresses

213157,434673,BMY,Why Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Bristol Myers Squibb in Focus
Headquartered in New York  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of 3 5  so far this year  The biopharmaceutical company is paying out a dividend of  0 41 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 05  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 74  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 64 is up 2 5  from last year  In the past five year period  Bristol Myers Squibb has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 2 42   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Bristol Myers s current payout ratio is 40   This means it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for BMY for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 15 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 27  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that BMY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200395169,200395169
213158,434674,BMY,Is Bristol Myers  BMY  A Solid Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bristol Myers has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 9  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Bristol Myers current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 25 3 over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Bristol Myers has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Bristol Myers stock in the near term too P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Bristol Myers  P CF ratio of 15 1 is lower than the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry average of 15 8  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bristol Myers currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Bristol Myers a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P S ratio for Bristol Myers is 3 7  a level that is lower than the industry average of 4  Clearly  BMY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Bristol Myers might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives BMY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat disappointing  The current quarter has seen no upward revisions in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a dismal impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 5 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped by 4 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bristol Myers Squibb Company Price and Consensus   However  the stock with a solid earnings surprise history and long term EPS growth rate of 5 5  has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBristol Myers is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Although the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  its sluggish industry rank  bottom 44  of more than 250 industries  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  Over the past two years  the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s performance has remained in line with the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the

2018 Results
Revenues came in at  0 9 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 million  Loss per share of  3 93 was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  4 38 
Our Take
The narrower than expected loss in the fourth quarter was encouraging  We expect investors  focus to remain on pipeline updates as the company has no approved product in its portfolio yet 
Prothena has discontinued the development of its lead pipeline candidate  NEOD001  The decision came as a major blow to the investors  as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead one  Hence  investors will now focus on the ongoing phase II study on prasinezumab  though results from the mid stage study on this candidate is not expected before 2020

213191,434707,BMY,Exelixis  EXEL  Earnings  Revenues Beat Estimates In Q4,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ EXEL   delivered better than expected results for fourth quarter 2018  wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates on strong performance by Cabometyx  
Following the announcement of the results  shares of Exelixis gained 7 38  in the after market trading session  However  Exelixis  shares have lost 24 1  in the past twelve months compared with the  decline of 17 1  

 
The company reported earnings of 37 cents  easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents  The bottom line was also up from 12 cents in the year ago quarter 
Net revenues came in at  228 6 million  up from  120 1 million in the year ago quarter  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  195 7 million 
Quarter in Detail
Net product revenues came in at  176 2 million  up 84  from the year ago quarter  driven by continued growth of Cabometyx in the United States for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  
In April 2016  the FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib   distinct from the capsule form  under the brand name Cabometyx  for the treatment of advanced RCC in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy  The FDA also expanded the drug s label for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC in December 2017 
Cabometyx generated  171 6 million net product revenues  Demand grew 8 4  sequentially 
Cometriq  cabozantinib capsules   for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer  generated  4 6 million in net product revenues 
Total collaboration revenues were  52 4 million compared with  24 4 million in the year ago quarter 
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses increased 77 9  to  57 3 million  stemming from higher personnel expenses and clinical trial costs  Selling  general and administrative expenses were  52 4 million  up 13 2  year over year  driven by increases in personnel expenses and stock based compensation 
Pipeline Update
In October 2018  Exelixis initiated a phase III trial  COSMIC 311  of single agent cabozantinib in patients with radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer  DTC  who have progressed up to two prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  VEGFR  targeted therapies  The co primary endpoints for the trial are progression free survival and objective response rate 
In November 2018  Exelixis and partner Ipsen obtained European Commission s approval for Cabometyx as a monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   a form of liver cancer in adults who have previously been treated with Nexavar  Per the agreement with Ipsen  Exelixis received a milestone payment of  40 0 million for this approval in January 2019  The approval was based on results from the CELESTIAL trial  The FDA also approved Cabometyx for the treatment of patients with HCC in January 2019 
In December 2018  Exelixis and Ipsen initiated a pivotal phase III study   COSMIC 312   to evaluate a Cabometyx combination therapy in treatment na ve advanced HCC  Moreover  an exploratory arm will also evaluate Cabometyx monotherapy in the first line setting for similar patients 
Exelixis inked deals with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Roche   OTC RHHBY   to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents  Earlier  Exelixis announced encouraging results from the dose escalation stage of the phase Ib COSMIC 021 study on Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq in previously untreated advanced RCC  The combination was well tolerated and showed promising anti tumor activity 
In January 2019  partner Daiichi Sankyo announced that Minnebro  esaxerenone  tablets were approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare as a treatment for patients with hypertension  The compound was identified during the prior research collaboration between Exelixis and Daiichi Sankyo  which the companies entered into in March 2006  and has been subsequently developed by Daiichi Sankyo 
Consequently  Exelixis will receive a  20 0 million milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of Minnebro in Japan  The company is also eligible for additional commercialization milestone payments and low double digit royalties on sales of Minnebro 
In September 2018  Exelixis announced that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  NCCN  has updated its Clinical Practice Guidelines to include new recommendations for Cabometyx  As a result of the update  Cabometyx is now recommended by the NCCN for the treatment of advanced RCC  regardless of patient risk status  favorable   intermediate  and poor risk  
2018 Results
Revenues came in at  853 8 million  up from  452 5 million in 2017  Also  revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  819 4 million  Earnings per share came in at  1 43  up from 49 cents in 2017  The top line also comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 30 
2019 Guidance
R D expenses are expected to be between  285 million and  315 million  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses are expected to be between  220 million and  240 million 
Our Take
Exelixis  fourth quarter results were impressive despite stiff competition from Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Sutent  Votrient and Inlyta  among others  Cabometyx continues to maintain its market leading position in RCC  The drug gained market share throughout the fourth quarter 
It ended the quarter with 34  market share backed by its broad label for advanced RCC and the recent NCCN update as the preferred TKI for the majority of both previously untreated and refractory RCC patients  Demand grew 6  sequentially  The company experienced a 10  increase in Cabometyx s prescriber base compared with that in the third quarter 
The label expansion of the drug for second line HCC should diversify the franchise and further boost sales 
We expect investors to focus on further label expansion of cabozantinib  Three pivotal trials   CheckMate 9ER  evaluating Cabometyx in combination with Opdivo in first line RCC  COSMIC 311 with single agent cabozantinib in second line DTC  and COSMIC 312  evaluating Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq in first line HCC   are underway

213209,434725,BMY,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Bristol Myers  BMY ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this biopharmaceutical company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Bristol Myers is 17 4   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Bristol Myers is 12 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 7 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 5 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 2 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Bristol Myers  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Bristol Myers a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

213210,434726,BMY,This Is Why Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Bristol Myers Squibb in Focus
Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is headquartered in New York  and is in the Medical sector  The stock has seen a price change of  3 39  since the start of the year  The biopharmaceutical company is paying out a dividend of  0 41 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 27  compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield of 2 74  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 64 is up 2 5  from last year  In the past five year period  Bristol Myers Squibb has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 2 42   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Bristol Myers s current payout ratio is 40   meaning it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
BMY is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 16 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 52  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that BMY is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200386364,200386364

213248,434764,BMY,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Bristol Myers Squibb in Focus
Headquartered in New York  Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is a Medical stock that has seen a price change of  5 69  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 41 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 35   In comparison  the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s yield is 2 81   while the S P 500 s yield is 2  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 64 is up 2 5  from last year  Bristol Myers Squibb has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 2 42   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Bristol Myers s current payout ratio is 43   This means it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  BMY expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  4 14 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 02  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  BMY is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-could-be-a-great-choice-200379487,200379487

213271,434787,BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  5 98 billion  up 9 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bristol Myers 
For Bristol Myers  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 12  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bristol Myers will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Bristol Myers would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 09  delivering a surprise of  19 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Bristol Myers doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bristolmyers-squibb-bmy-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376728,200376728

213501,435017,BMY,Exelixis  EXEL  Q3 Earnings  Revenues Beat On Cabometyx Sales,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ EXEL   delivered better than expected results for third quarter 2018  wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates on strong performance by Cabometyx  
Following the announcement of the results  shares of Exelixis gained 13 1  in the after market trading session  However  Exelixis  shares have lost 50 8  in the year so far  compared with the  decline of 15 7  

 
The company reported earnings of 41 cents  easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents  The bottom line was also up from 26 cents reported in the year ago quarter 
Net revenues came in at  225 4 million  up from  152 5 million in the year ago quarter  The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  166 4 million 
Quarter in Detail
Net product revenues came in at  162 9 million  up 69  from the year ago quarter  driven by continued growth of Cabometyx in the United States for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  
The FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib   distinct from the capsule form  under the brand name Cabometyx in April 2016  for the treatment of advanced RCC in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy  The FDA also expanded the drug s label for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC in December 2017 
Cabometyx generated  158 3 million net product revenues  Demand grew 5  sequentially 
Cometriq  cabozantinib capsules   for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer  generated  4 7 million in net product revenues 
Total collaboration revenues were  62 5 million compared with  56 1 million in the year ago quarter  The revenues included the recognition of milestone payments of  36 9 million and  5 0 million from the company s collaboration with Ipsen Pharma SAS for the anticipated approval of Cabometyx for previously treated HCC in the European Union and the approval of the drug in Canada for previously treated RCC  respectively 
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses increased 56 8  to  44 7 million  stemming from higher personnel expenses  clinical trial costs  and consulting and outside services  Selling  general and administrative expenses were  48 1 million  up 26 3   driven by increases in personnel expenses and stock based compensation 
Pipeline Update
In September 2018  Exelixis announced that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  NCCN  has updated its Clinical Practice Guidelines to include new recommendations for Cabometyx  As a result of the update  Cabometyx is now recommended by the NCCN for the treatment of advanced RCC  regardless of patient risk status  favorable   intermediate  and poor risk  
We remind investors that Exelixis has already submitted a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  to the FDA for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   The EMA also accepted the company s application for the addition of HCC indication  The FDA accepted the company s sNDA for Cabometyx as a treatment for patients with previously treated advanced HCC and set a target action date of Jan 14  2019 
In addition  Exelixis and partner Ipsen received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP   the scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency  EMA   for the label expansion of Cabometyx tablets as a monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  in adults  who have been previously treated with Nexavar  sorafenib  
Exelixis recently announced encouraging results from the dose escalation stage of the phase Ib COSMIC 021 study of Cabometyx in combination with Tecentriq  in previously untreated advanced RCC  The combination was well tolerated and showed promising anti tumor activity 
In October 2018  Exelixis initiated a phase III trial  COSMIC 311  of single agent cabozantinib in patients with radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer  DTC  who have progressed up to two prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  VEGFR  targeted therapies  The co primary endpoints for the trial are progression free survival and objective response rate 
Meanwhile  Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Roche Holding   OTC RHHBY   to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017 The phase III CheckMate 9ER study is evaluating cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo versus Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Sutent among treatment naive RCC patients 
The study is enrolling patients globally  and being conducted by Bristol Myers  The triplet combination of cabozantinib  Opdivo and Yervoy continues to be evaluated in the ongoing Phase 1b trial in patients with advanced genitourinary malignancies 
2018 Guidance Updated
Exelixis now expects total costs and operating expenses for 2018 to be  410   420 million compared with the earlier projection of  430  460 million  The range was updated due to timing of clinical trial expenses  primarily related to the planned and ongoing combination trials  
Our Take
Exelixis  third quarter results were impressive amid stiff competition from Sutent  Votrient and Inlyta  among others  The approval of Opdivo and Yervoy for the treatment of poor and intermediate risk first line RCC has further increased competition   The company experienced an 11  increase in Cabometyx s prescriber base as compared to the second quarter 
We expect Cabometyx sales to grow as the drug is now approved for first line RCC  which will expand the eligible patient population in the United States and also eat into the market share of two key drugs   Sutent and Votrient  We expect investors  to focus on further label expansion of cabozantinib 
A potential approval for HCC  liver cancer  early next year should further boost demand and diversify the franchise  given the huge market for liver cancer

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which after closing the books on summer vacations with the short week  saw some profit taking in the equity markets  but they all remained with strong long term charts 
Elsewhere look for Gold to possibly pause in its downtrend while Crude Oil slowly drifts higher long term  The US Dollar Index is marking time sideways while US Treasuries are biased to continue lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets did nothing to change their downside trends 
Volatility has crept higher and set up to slowly continue  keeping pressure on equity markets  The equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   all reacted with moves lower on the week  The QQQ was the hardest hit and then the small caps with the SPY down less than 1   Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

213530,435046,BMY,Exelixis  Cabometyx Gets EU Nod For First Line Kidney Cancer,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc  s   NASDAQ EXEL   European partner Ipsen announced that the European Commission  EC  has granted approval to Cabometyx  cabozantinib  for an expanded indication  The EC approved Cabometyx 20 mg  40 mg and 60 mg for the first line treatment of adults with intermediate  or poor risk advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC    a kind of kidney cancer in the European Union 
The approval was expected in March  The company received positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   for the use of Cabometyx for the above indication 
The EU approval in the first line setting was based on results of the CABOSUN trial  which met its primary endpoint of improving progression free survival compared with Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Sutent  sunitinib  in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC 
Cabometyxis already marketed in the EU for advanced RCC in adults following prior vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  targeted therapy  In the United States  Cabometyx was approved for first line treatment of advanced RCC in December last year  approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date 
Cabometyx generated  128 9 million net product revenues in the first quarter of 2018 driven by growth in demand following U S  approval in the first lien setting  An approval in Europe will further boost Exelixis  top line 
Per the terms of the collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen  Exelixis will receive a milestone payment of  50 million for the EC approval  of which about  46 million was recognized as collaboration revenues in the first quarter of 2018  The payment will be made by Ipsen within the next 70 days 
Exelixis  shares have lost 32 8  over a year  wider than the s decline of 3 6  

We remind investors that Exelixis entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen in February 2016 for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib whereby Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside the United States  Canada and Japan 
Exelixis has also inked agreements with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Roche Holding   OTC RHHBY   to develop cabozantinib in combination with their immunotherapy agents in 2017

213560,435076,BMY,FDA Nods To AstraZeneca s Tagrisso For First Line NSCLC  revised ,opinion,"AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN   announced that it has secured an FDA approval for the label expansion of its marketed drug  Tagrisso  osimertinib   for first line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  whose tumors have EGFR mutations 
Notably  Tagrisso is approved in the United States  European Union  Japan and China as second line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC  who showed progress following treatment with an EGFR TKI due to the EGFR T790M resistance mutation 
Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the industry year to date  The stock has gained 3 7  versus the  s decline of 3 3  

 
We remind investors that last December  the FDA accepted and granted a priority review to the company s supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Tagrisso for the aforementioned indication 
The FDA nod was based on positive data from the phase III FLAURA study  which compared Tagrisso with the standard of care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in the first line lung cancer setting 
Data from the trial showed that the chance of progression or death risk was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared with the commonly used EGFR inhibitors  The median progression free survival was 18 9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10 2 months in the comparator arm  Tagrisso was well tolerated in the trial with a safety profile  consistent with the previous experience 
Importantly  a similar application for Tagrisso s label expansion is under review in the EU as well as Japan with a decision expected in the second half of 2018 
Tagrisso registered sales of  955 million in 2017  reflecting growth of 126  from the year ago period and accounting for 5  of total sales  A potential approval in the first line setting will further boost the drug s prospects  However  the lung cancer market is crowded with several companies developing or marketing treatments  While Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY    Astellas  Tarceva is approved for treating NSCLC  Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   is developing its drug Dacomitinib in a phase III study as a first line treatment for the indication  Moreover  Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   is developing Opdivo as a treatment for NSCLC and AstraZeneca too has Iressa approved for treating NSCLC and is also developing Imfinzi for the same indication AstraZeneca PLC Price

213596,435112,BMY,Is A Beat In The Cards For Celldex  CLDX  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"We expect Celldex Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ CLDX   to beat expectations when it reports fourth quarter 2017 results next month  Its performance has been encouraging as it beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and met the same in one  delivering an average positive surprise of 15 36  
In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41 67  
However  Celldex Therapeutics  shares have lost 32 7  in the past year compared with a 2 5  decline for the  during this period 

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Celldex earns revenues entirely from product development and licensing agreements  and contracts and grants  The company recognizes revenues under its clinical trial collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  for varlilumab  The company will continue to record revenues from these sources in the fourth quarter of 2017 
With no approved product in its portfolio  investor focus will remain on pipeline development 
In December 2017  the company started patient enrollment in a phase I study  evaluating its new candidate  CDX 1140  for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors  Notably  CDX 1140 is a fully human antibody that targets CD40  an immune response activator 
In November 2017  Celldex announced data from a phase II study  evaluating a combination of its most advanced pipeline candidate  glembatumumab vedotin  and varlilumab in melanoma  The median progression free survival was 2 6 months  with 52  of patients having stable disease for six weeks or more 
The study is also evaluating glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitors  including either Bristol Myers  Opdivo or Merck s Keytruda 
It also initiated a phase II study on its human monoclonal antibody  CDX 3379 in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma   HNSCC    The phase II study will evaluate CDX 3379 in combination with Eli Lilly s Erbitux in patients with advanced HNSCC who are Erbitux resistant and previously treated with an anti PD1 checkpoint inhibitor 
Apart from glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab  Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline  including CDX 1401 CDX 301  phase II   multiple solid tumors  and CDX 014  phase I   advanced renal cell carcinoma  among others 
Though R D and SG A costs declined in the third quarter  operating expenses may vary on a quarterly basis 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that Celldex is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  18 28   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 19 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 23 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Celldex currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Celldex Therapeutics  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

Here are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

213827,435343,BMY,Exelixis Submits SNDA For Kidney Cancer Drug Cabometyx,opinion,"Exelixis  Inc    NASDAQ EXEL   announced that it has completed the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  to the FDA for Cabometyx tablets for patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  
The sNDA submission was based on positive results from phase II trial  CABOSUN  in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate  or poor risk disease per the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium  IMDC  
An independent radiology review committee has confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator assessed progression free survival  PFS  in the CABOSUN trial  The study compared Cabometyx to Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Sutent in the first line treatment of intermediate  or poor risk advanced RCC patients  As per the analysis from the committee  Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death as measured by PFS 
In May 2016  Exelixis announced that CABOSUN met its primary endpoint as Cabometyx demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to Sutent in patients with advanced intermediate  or poor risk RCC as determined by investigator assessment 
We remind investors that Cabometyx was approved by the FDA in Apr 2016 for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who received prior anti angiogenic therapy  A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results 
New patient starts  refills for patients already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base for Cabometyx are driving the drug s sales  The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales was driven by growth in prescriptions 
Exelixis has collaborated with Bristol Myers Squibb Co    NYSE BMY   and Roche Holdings   OTC RHHBY   for the development of the drug in combination with immunotherapy agents 

Exelixis  share price has increased 79 6  year to date compared with the  gain of 7 4  
Earlier in the week  Bristol Myers announced disappointing top line results from the CheckMate 214 trial which investigated immuno oncology drug Opdivo in combination with Yervoy versus Sutent in intermediate and poor risk patients previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC  The trial did not meet its primary endpoint 
We note that renal cell carcinoma  RCC  is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults and accounts for more than 100 000 deaths worldwide each year  Among these  clear cell RCC is the most prevalent type of RCC and constitutes 80 90  of all cases thereby underlying the demand for the same 
Hence a potential approval of Cabometyx for previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC will boost sales

213828,435344,BMY,Here s Why Clovis Stock Is Up Almost 60  So Far In 2017,opinion,"Shares of Clovis Oncology  Inc    NASDAQ CLVS   have witnessed a continuous upside this year  Shares of this small biotech company are up 62 3  so far this year  outperforming the 7 2  increase registered by the  during this period  Let s analyze the factors that have driven the rally so far 

The company s only approved drug  Rubraca  has shown an impressive growth trend in 2017  The drug received accelerated approval in Dec 2016  The company s commercialization efforts have helped the ovarian cancer drug register almost 100  growth in sales sequentially in the second quarter of 2017  Rubraca sales were  21 7 million in the first half of 2017  The company had 1100 new patients on therapy in the period 
Rubraca is a PARP inhibitor  which is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies  The patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca  The drug was in licensed from Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   in 2011 
Two confirmatory studies   ARIEL3 and ARIEL4   are being conducted by Clovis for converting the accelerated approval to continued approval of Rubraca 
The company s shares got a boost when it announced positive top line results from ARIEL 3 in June 2017  Promising progression free survival  PFS  and safety results from the pivotal maintenance confirmatory study demonstrated that Rubraca had a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients 
Clovis is planning to file a supplemental new drug application  sNDA  to the FDA by October this year based on ARIEL 3 data to include second line or later maintenance indication for advanced ovarian cancer on the label of Rubraca  The company expects the label expansion to increase patient population by at least four times 
Meanwhile  the other phase III confirmatory study    ARIEL4    is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy  Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication  An approval is expected in EU in the first quarter of 2018 and Clovis is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same 
There is immense commercial potential for Rubraca in the target market due to increasing demand for PARP inhibitors  Per the American Cancer Society  ovarian cancer ranks fifth in deaths from cancer among women  Over 22 440 cases of ovarian cancer are estimated to be diagnosed in the U S  in 2017  There is a huge unmet need for new treatment options  given that one in four women with ovarian cancer has a germline or somatic BRCA mutation 
Rubraca is also being developed in additional cancer indications either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents  including Tecentriq Rubraca combination in gynecologic cancers  This combination study is sponsored by Roche  Moreover  in Jul 2017 the company collaborated with Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   to evaluate Rubraca in combination with the latter s Opdivo in ovarian  breast and prostate cancer 
It is important to note that the ovarian cancer market is already crowded with the presence of major players  With the launch of Tesaro  Inc  s   NASDAQ TSRO   Zejula in Apr 2017  competition has intensified further Clovis Oncology  Inc  Price and Consensus

We note that Cabometyx tablets were approved for previously treated advanced kidney cancer in the U S  in Apr 2016  Cabometyx was also approved in EU in Sep 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  targeted therapy 
An independent radiology review committee has confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator assessed progression free survival  PFS  in the CABOSUN trial 
The randomized  open label  active controlled phase II trial enrolled 157 patients with advanced RCC  Patients were randomized 1 1 to receive Cabometyx  60 mg once daily  or Sutent  50 mg once daily  four weeks on followed by two weeks off   The trial was conducted by The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology as part of Exelixis  agreement with the National Cancer Institute s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program  NCI CTEP  
As per the analysis from the committee  Cabometyx demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in the rate of disease progression or death as measured by PFS 
We note that Exelixis plans to submit its supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for Cabometyx as a treatment of first line advanced RCC in the third quarter of 2017 
In May 2016  Exelixis announced that CABOSUN met its primary endpoint as Cabometyx demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared to Sutent in patients with advanced intermediate  or poor risk RCC as determined by investigator assessment 

Exelixis  shares have moved up 50 3  year to date compared with the Zacks classified  industry s improvement of 6 4  
Initial uptake of the drug was encouraging and is expected to propel the top line in the forthcoming quarters in 2017 
A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost results 
Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 clinical studies across multiple indications 
In early 2017  Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   and Roche   OTC RHHBY   to collaborate on the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents  Exelixis and Bristol Myers will evaluate cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo  nivolumab  alone or in combination with Yervoy  ipilimumab  in a phase III trial in first line RCC  and potentially in other tumor types including advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC

The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the optimal dose and schedule of daily oral administration of cabozantinib when given in combination with Tecentriq for the subsequent expansion stage 
The FDA granted accelerated approval to immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq in May 2016 for treating locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  Initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging  In Oct 2016  Tecentriq became the first and only anti PDL1 cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC 
The phase Ib open label study is divided in two parts  a dose escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase  The dose escalation phase will enroll nine to 36 patients with inoperable  locally advanced  metastatic or recurrent UC  including renal  pelvis  ureter  urinary bladder and urethra  after prior platinum based therapy or RCC with or without prior systemic therapy 
The starting dose of cabozantinib will be 40 mg daily which can be increased to 60 mg daily or decreased to 20 mg daily  The patients enrolled will receive the standard Tecentriq dosing regimen  1200 mg infusion once every 3 weeks  
The secondary end points of the dose escalation stage are to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of daily oral administration of cabozantinib when given in combination with Tecentriq and to assess safety of the combination therapy through the evaluation of incidence and severity of adverse events  including immune related adverse events 
Upon determination of the recommended dose and schedule  the trial will enroll four expansion cohorts  each with up to 30 patients  for a total of up to 120 patients with advanced or metastatic UC or RCC 
Exelixis is developing cabozantinib in a broad development program comprising over 45 clinical studies across multiple indications  The company received a significant boost in Apr 2016 when the FDA approved the tablet formulation of cabozantinib   distinct from the capsule form  under the brand name Cabometyx for the treatment of RCC in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy 
Cabometyx was also approved in EU in Sep 2016 for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults who have received prior vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  targeted therapy

Net revenue came in at  80 9 million  significantly up from  15 4 million in the prior year quarter  Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  65 6 million   Revenues were boosted by the FDA approval of a tablet formulation of cabozantinib   distinct from the capsule form  under the brand name Cabometyx in Apr 2016 for the treatment of RCC in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy 
Exelixis  share price has increased 62 2  year to date compared with the Zacks classified   industry s gain of 5 5  

Quarter in Detail
Total product revenue was  68 9 million  up from  9 1 million in the year ago quarter  Cabometyx generated  62 4 million in net product revenue  up 657  year over year and up 33  sequentially  Cometriq  cabozantinib  capsules for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer generated  6 5 million in net product revenue  Customer demand increased by approximately 40  in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter driven by improvements in new patient starts  refills for patients already on therapy and broad expansion of the Cabometyx prescriber base 
Total collaboration revenue was at  12 0 million compared to  6 3 million in the year ago quarter 
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses declined 19 8  to  23 2 million due  to decrease in research and development expenses as a result of fall in clinical trial costs for the phase III trial  METEOR  in advanced RCC and share based compensation   Selling  general and administrative expenses were  34 3 million  down 1 7  from a year ago due to decline in marketing costs rising from a decreasing losses under the collaboration agreement with Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Genentech and stock based compensation Exelixis  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   Pipeline Update
The company continues to focus on the launch of Cabometyx in the U S  Exelixis plans to file a supplemental New Drug Application  sNDA  for cabozantinib as a treatment for previously untreated patients with advanced RCC in third quarter 2017 based on the positive data from the randomized phase II trial  CABOSUN 
In Mar 2017  the FDA granted cabozantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of HCC  A phase III trial  CELESTIAL is currently ongoing in patients with advanced HCC  The company now expects completing the second intermin analysis at 75  of the events in the second half of 2017 
During the first quarter  Exelixis announced agreements with The Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   and Roche to collaborate on the development of cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents 
Meanwhile  Exelixis and Roche announced that the phase III trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq in third line advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer  achieved full enrollment in first quarter 2017  Roche also announced that IMspire150 TRILOGY  which evaluates the combination of Cotellic  atezolizumab  and Xelboraf in first line BRAF V600 mutation positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  enrolled its first patient in Jan 2017 while IMspire170  the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and atezolizumab versus pembrolizumab in first line BRAF wild type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  is likely to enroll its first patient in the second quarter of this year 
2017 Guidance
Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2017 in the range of  290 million  310 million  This guidance includes about  25 million of non cash costs and expenses related primarily to stock based compensation expense 
Our Take
Exelixis posted an earnings in the first quarter compared to a loss in the year ago quarter which was encouraging  The sequential increase in Cabometyx sales is a positive for the company  Going forward  we expect investor on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Heska Corporation   NASDAQ HSKA   which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Heska s earnings estimates for 2017 have increased to  1 65 from  1 53 over the last 60 days  The company posted positive surprises all the four trailing quarters with an average beat of 291 54   Its share price has increased 47 2  this year so far

Calithera Biosciences  Inc   a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company yesterday announced they will be offering up 4 500 000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering  All of the common stock is being offered by Calithera 
Calithera Biosciences  Inc  CEO s Comments
Comments from March 16th on announcement of Fourth Quarter 2016 financial results said by Susan Molineaux  PhD  President and Chief Executive Officer of Calithera 

2016 was a transformative year for Calithera as our lead product candidate CB 839 entered into multiple novel combination trials and progressed towards Phase II  and CB 1158 advanced into clinical development leading to a partnership with Incyte Pharmaceuticals for a strategic development and commercialization collaboration in January 2017 
Looking forward to 2017  we expect to highlight new clinical data from each of our clinical programs at scientific meetings  with clinical data expected from CB 1158 in the first half of the year  and multiple clinical updates on CB 839 combination trials in the second half of 2017  This includes the first clinical data presentation of CB 839 dosed in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb s Opdivo  


CALA Technical Analysis

CALA opened trading yesterday at  12 45 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  12 40  Shares closed trading yesterday at  12 35 and spiked down after market to  11 50  equivalent to a 7  decrease from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time CALA traded below these levels we have to go all the way back to February 28th  when it traded at  9 00 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down CALA had been in an overall upward trend dating back to November 28th  2016 when it traded at  3 15  CALA has a float of 7 15 million shares and traded 1 02 times the normal daily trading volume on Monday  Even though it is higher priced than most penny stocks I trade  it still looks like it could provide some opportunity 
For trading purposes  I would like to see CALA open trading on Tuesday below  11 75 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 20 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

214056,435572,BMY,AVEO Pharmaceuticals   AVEO  Q3 Loss Lower Than Expected,opinion,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AVEO   reported a third quarter 2016 loss of 7 cents per share  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents  The company had reported earnings of 14 cents per share in the year ago period AVEO does not have any approved products in its portfolio  The company s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues  milestone and other payments  Total collaboration revenue in the third quarter was approximately  1 million  compared with  15 2 million in the year ago quarter 
Quarterly Highlights
Research   development expenses were  4 4 million  compared with  4 5 million in the year ago period  General and administrative expenses also decreased 3 8  year over year to  2 1 million 
During the quarter  AVEO announced the initiation of a phase I II study  TiNivo  evaluating its lead pipeline candidate tivozanib  in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb Company s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo  anti PD 1 therapy   for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer  RCC   Initial safety results from the phase I portion of the phase I II study should be out in the first half of 2017 
AVEO is also comparing tivozanib to Nexavar in a randomized  controlled  multi center  open label pivotal phase III study  TIVO 3  for the treatment of patients with refractory advanced RCC  Top line data from the study is anticipated in the first quarter of 2018  Results from the TIVO 3 study  along with the previously completed TIVO 1 study  first line treatment of RCC   are expected to support a first  and third line indication for tivozanib in the U S 
Meanwhile  regulatory application seeking approval for tivozanib for the first line treatment of advanced RCC is currently under review in Europe  The application was submitted by AVEO s partner  EUSA Pharma  EUSA Pharma is currently working on submitting responses to the European Medicines Agency s Day 120 List of Questions before the end of 2016 
AVEO expects that its cash resources will allow the company to fund its planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2017  AVEO also expects that these cash resources  along with certain anticipated operational milestone payments from its collaboration partners  could allow the company to fund the U S  tivozanib development strategy through at least TIVO 3 study top line data as well as a tivozanib PD 1 inhibitor combination study 
AVEO anticipates a milestone rich calendar over the upcoming months  across both its proprietary and partnered programs  We note that the company has retained significant North American rights for its oncology pipeline while its non oncology pipeline is being advanced through several partnerships including the likes of Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   
Tivozanib s approval in the EU would trigger a milestone payment to AVEO from EUSA Pharma

While sales in the U S  markets surged 46  to  2 7 billion  international revenues were down 6   International revenues declined primarily due to lower hepatitis C virus  HCV  sales in Japan and France  Adjusted for foreign exchange impact  international revenues were still down 4

214141,435657,BMY,Synta  SNTA  Cuts Q2 Loss Y Y  Madrigal Merger In Focus,opinion,"Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp    NASDAQ SNTA   reported a second quarter 2016 loss of 2 cents per share  much lower than the year ago loss of 15 cents With no approved product in its portfolio at the moment  the company does not generate revenues yet 
In the second quarter of 2016  research and development  R D  expenses decreased by  16 5 million  General and administrative expenses increased 14 9  year over year to  3 6 million SYNTA PHARMACT Price   Focus on Merger
In Apr 2016  Synta announced that it will be merging with a privately held company  Madrigal Pharmaceuticals  Inc   in an all stock transaction  This combined company will focus on the development of novel small molecule drugs addressing major unmet needs in cardiovascular metabolic diseases and non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  
MGL 3196  which is Madrigal s lead candidate  is phase II ready for the treatment of NASH and heterozygous as well as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
Once the proposed merger closes  Madrigal shareholders will own 64  of the combined company while Synta shareholders will own 36   The merger is slated to close in the third quarter of 2016 
We note that Synta had earlier focused on cancer treatments but the company suffered a setback last year when it decided to terminate a phase III study  GALAXY 2  on its lead pipeline candidate ganetespib  for the second line treatment of advanced non small cell lung adenocarcinoma  due to futility  Thereafter  the company implemented strategic restructuring and discontinued a substantial portion of its R D activities relating to ganetespib and its oncology pipeline 
However  the company continues to conduct limited activities with respect to ganetespib including providing support for a couple of ongoing investigator sponsored studies in ovarian cancer  phase II   GANNET53  and sarcoma  phase I   SARC 023    enrollment in both studies expected to be completed in 2017  Limited activities will also be continued for the candidates from its Hsp90 inhibitor drug conjugate  HDC  program  including its lead HDC candidate STA 12 8666 
Synta has decided not to pursue an investigational new drug  IND  submission for STA 12 8666 in the immediate future  However  the company is currently conducting pre clinical studies on STA 12 8666 to support an IND submission  if it determines to pursue such a submission at some point in the future 
We expect investor focus to remain on updates from the Madrigal transaction  going forward

The company s supplemental biologics license application for Opdivo has been accepted for priority review by the FDA  With the FDA granting priority review status  a response should be out by Nov 11  2016  We remind investors that Opdivo was granted Breakthrough Therapy status in the U S  for SCCHN in Apr 2016 
The EMA has validated a type II variation application for the same patient population  The validation marks the initiation of the EMA s centralized review process BRISTOL MYERS Price   We are encouraged by the simultaneous acceptance of Opdivo for review in the U S  and EU  Data from the CheckMate  141 study has demonstrated that Opdivo is the first and only PD 1 inhibitor to show an overall survival benefit in a phase III study in these patients

We note that Opdivo recorded worldwide revenues of  942 million in 2015  Label expansion into additional indications would give Opdivo access to an expanded patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug

214167,435683,BMY,ResMed  RMD  Q4 Earnings  Disappointment In The Cards ,opinion,"ResMed Inc    NYSE RMD   is scheduled to report its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings on Jul 28  after the closing bell 
Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1 45  Though on a brighter note  ResMed s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters  with an average beat of 1 92  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement RESMED INC Price and EPS Surprise
    
Factors at Play 
ResMed opened its account in the fourth quarter with the completion of Brightree s acquisition   a health information technology group  a deal which was signed in the preceding quarter  Management expects this acquisition to expand ResMed s Air Solutions platform with a stronger end to end value proposition for ResMed s customers 
Per management s earlier declaration  financial integration of Brightree within its operations will start immediately after completion of the buyout  Following this  the deal is predicted to be accretive immediately to ResMed s gross margins and adjusted EPS 
Consequently we believe this accretion to get evident from the yet to be released fiscal fourth quarter results  in the form of raised gross margin and bottom line figures  Notably  management estimates that the Brightree acquisition will have a positive impact of 70 100 basis points on ResMed s gross margin in the fourth quarter 
Furthermore  management believes that initiation of the integration process for its recently acquired Innova Labs  has offered ResMed considerable opportunities to grow its revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter and beyond  by providing portable oxygen concentrators through its global market channels 
In terms of product categories  management remained particularly optimistic about ResMed s mask and accessories category  wherein a solid growth is expected in the fourth quarter and going ahead 
On the flip side  the failure of the SERVE HF trial in May 2015 has been a drag to company s sales from Adaptive Servo Ventilation  ASV  devices for quite some time  Management expects to witness similar weak ASV growth trend in the fourth quarter too  with the largest impact on the company s EMEA and APAC region   
Management also remains confident of the company s strategy to continue to make incremental investments across its research and development  R D  portfolio  which in turn might raise the R D expenses for the quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that ResMed is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   ResMed has an earnings ESP of 0 00  That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 74 cents 
Zacks Rank  ResMed has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which along with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

214168,435684,BMY,GNC Holdings  GNC  Q2 Earnings  Will The Stock Disappoint ,opinion,"GNC Holdings  Inc    NYSE GNC     a specialty retailer of health and nutrition related products   is scheduled to report its second quarter 2016 financial results on Jul 28  before the opening bell 
Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 8 00   Moreover  GNC Holdings  earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters  with an average miss of 4 89  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
 GNC HOLDINGS Price and EPS Surprise
    
Factors at Play
GNC Holdings started off 2016 on a discouraging note  with its strong suite in vitamin products hit by deteriorating sales of Vitapaks  To address this issue  management has been taking proactive efforts by improving inventory planning and production process  However it is mostly unlikely for consequences of these efforts to stem the plunge in the near term  
Besides  the company has also started focusing extensively on other vitamin products by offering store associates training to prioritise vitamin solutions for its customers  capitalizing on the fact that over 70  of Americans are nutrition deficient through their diets  Moreover  as per management s earlier directive  new promotions and store incentives must have started rolling out by now 
We expect these initiatives might bring in a moderate improvement in the vitamin business  which will be evident from GNC Holdings  yet to be reported quarter results 
With respect to its newly introduced products  GNC Holdings successfully doubled its revenue in Mar 2016  before it was impacted by the effect of cannibalization  Management holds a similar positive outlook from the outcome of new products in the second quarter as well 
Moreover  management expects the company to record a refranchising pre tax gain of approximately  20 million in the second quarter  Further  in order to better align its financial reporting structure  beginning in the second quarter  the company will be changing its reportable operating segment from Retail  Franchise and Manufacturing Wholesale to U S    Canada  International and Manufacturing Wholesale  as per its earlier announced plan 
On the flip side  GNC Holdings  gross margin is anticipated to repeat a dreary performance in the second quarter as well as it had in the previous quarter  with domestic retail product margin rate expected to stay low  
On the other hand  too many discounts on excess vitamin inventory nearing expiration date has continued the negative trends of the company s vitamin business  which has been plaguing the company in recent times  Although management has been trying hard to resolve this problem  no near term respite is likely as of now  This means the company will continue to see the declining trends in this business in the second quarter as well   
GNC Holdings previously slashed its bottom line projection for 2016 on the assumption that these declining sales trend will continue to affect it for the rest of 2016 as well  The company now expects to post adjusted EPS in the range of  2 80  2 90 for 2016  compared with the previous guided range of  3 15  3 35  excluding the net gain from corporate to franchise store conversions   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 EPS is stands at  2 87  within the company s guidance range 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that GNC Holdings is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   GNC Holdings has an earnings ESP of  1 30  That is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 76 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 77 cents 
Zacks Rank  GNC Holdings has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which along with a  1 30   ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  
Other Stocks to Consider 
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

214195,435711,BMY,Bristol Myers Buys Cormorant  Focus On Immuno Oncology,opinion,"Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   announced that it has acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals   a privately held Stockholm  Sweden based pharmaceutical company focused on the development of treatments targeting cancer and rare diseases 
Bristol Myers has agreed to make upfront and near term milestone payments of up to  95 million and an additional consideration of up to  425 million depending on the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
With this acquisition  Bristol Myers has gained full access to Cormorant s HuMax IL8 antibody program and to its lead candidate HuMax IL8  The candidate is a phase I II monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin 8  IL 8  and has the potential to enhance immune response along with increasing the efficacy of existing cancer medicines through a combination therapy 
We note that Cormorant had gained the rights to HuMax IL8 from Genmab A S  under an exclusive license agreement in 2012  Genmab had acquired the candidate via an asset exchange agreement with Medarex in 2007  Medarex was acquired by Bristol Myers for  2 4 billion in 2009 
We believe that the Cormorant acquisition is in line with Bristol Myers  strategy of boosting and strengthening its immuno oncology pipeline  It will enable the company to expedite the development and help bring to market transformational immunotherapies  The company s immuno oncology portfolio currently consists of immunotherapies like Yervoy  Opdivo and Empliciti 
Bristol Myers is collaborating with several companies for the evaluation of Opdivo in combination with other cancer regimens  Last week  the company announced an exclusive clinical collaboration agreement with PsiOxus Therapeutics for the evaluation of the latter s enadenotucirev in combination with Opdivo for the treatment of a range of tumor types in late stage cancer patients 
Meanwhile  Bristol Myers has been active on the acquisition front  Notably  the Cormorant acquisition is Bristol Myers  second in as many months and it is not just immuno oncology that is in focus  In a bid to strengthen and accelerate the development of its immunoscience pipeline  Bristol Myers acquired privately held biotech company  Padlock Therapeutics  in Apr 2016 
We expect to see the company continuing to pursue acquisitions deals over the coming quarters across a range of therapeutic areas

214247,435763,BMY,Infinity Regains Duvelisib Rights  Announces Restructuring,opinion,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ INFI   announced that AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   has exercised its right to terminate the collaboration with the company for the development and commercialization of duvelisib  Both companies had entered into discussions related to the restructuring of the partnership  which failed to arrive at a mutually attractive financial structure for the continuation of the collaboration 
With the termination of this agreement  Infinity has regained worldwide rights to duvelisib  Neither Infinity nor AbbVie will owe future financial obligations to each other  The termination of the agreement will be effective from Sep 23  2016 
We note that Infinity had entered into a collaboration and license agreement with AbbVie to jointly develop and commercialize duvelisib for oncology indications in Sep 2014 
Currently  Infinity is exploring strategic options for the duvelisib program that will support the submission of global regulatory applications and commercialization of duvelisib  Infinity will continue to focus its efforts on filing a new drug application for duvelisib with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2016 
The company s filing strategy includes the incorporation of data from both DUO and DYNAMO studies  While DUO is a randomized phase III monotherapy study in patients with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL   DYNAMO is a single arm  phase II monotherapy study in patients with refractory indolent non Hodgkin lymphoma  iNHL  
Infinity plans to seek feedback from the FDA regarding the DYNAMO data  which was announced earlier this month  In addition  the company expects to report top line data from the DUO study  based on the results of an interim analysis  in the third quarter of 2016 
Additionally  the company plans to focus on SYNCHRONY   a combination study on duvelisib plus Gazyva in CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma patients who were previously treated with a Bruton s tyrosine kinase inhibitor and FRESCO   a combination study in patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma planned to evaluate the potential of duvelisib to replace chemotherapy 
The company intends to discuss with the FDA the potential for FRESCO to serve as a confirmatory study for full approval in follicular lymphoma if duvelisib receives an accelerated approval based on the DYNAMO study 
Announces Restructuring Plan
Infinity announced that it also plans to eliminate 100 positions across the organization  representing approximately 58  of the company s workforce  Earlier this month  the company had said that it will close down its discovery research organization impacting 21  of the company s workforce or 46 positions 
The company s restructuring plans also include closing BRAVURA  a phase III study on duvelisib in patients with relapsed iNHL and CONTEMPO  a phase Ib II study on duvelisib in treatment na ve patients with follicular lymphoma  Moreover  Infinity will not proceed with the phase Ib II study on duvelisib in combination with Venclexta 
The company currently expects to incur severance  benefit and related costs of approximately  8 million  with future cash outlays of  5 million expected to be paid at end 2016 and up to approximately  3 million expected to be paid at end 2017  The company currently expects clinical trial and related development close down costs between  5 million and  7 million  and expects the related cash outlays to be paid during the end of this year 
The company expects this restructuring to be substantially completed by Jul 15  2016  and to be fully completed by Dec 31  2016 
Considering that Infinity is highly dependent on successful development of duvelisib for growth  the termination of the duvelisib agreement with AbbVie is a huge setback for Infinity  The company is now solely responsible for the development of the candidate and has to bear all related costs

We note that Epidiolex is currently in phase III development for the treatment of a number of rare pediatric epilepsy disorders   Dravet syndrome  Lennox Gastaut syndrome  LGS  and tuberous sclerosis complex  TSC   While positive data from the first phase III study in Dravet syndrome was announced in Mar 2016  first phase III study results in LGS are anticipated this month 
Additionally  GW Pharma announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug status to Epidiolex for the treatment of IS  Under the Orphan Drug Act  the FDA usually grants orphan drug status to drugs that are being developed for the treatment of a rare disease or condition affecting less than 200 000 patients in the U S 
Per the company s press release  every year there are about 2 000 to 4 000 new cases of IS in the U S  and is usually associated with poor long term overall prognosis  Considering the lack of treatment options for children suffering from IS  successful development and subsequent approval of Epidiolex will be a huge boost for both the eligible patient population and the company 
Epidiolex also enjoys orphan drug status from the FDA for the treatment of Dravet syndrome  LGS and TSC  Additionally  GW Pharma has received Fast Track status from the FDA and orphan status in the EU for Epidiolex for the treatment of Dravet syndrome

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Combat Volatility with These 5 Low Beta Stocks 

For investors looking to cut their portfolio risk  low beat stocks are great  A lower level of market exposure means that losses will be minimized in case of a downturn  This is why an investor with a long term horizon prefers to invest in stocks carrying lower risks  One of the most popular metrics used to measure such risk is beta 

Understanding Beta
	Beta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market  we are considering S P 500 here  
	If a company has a beta of 1  it means that the volatility of the stock is the same as that of the S P 500  In the same way  if the stock s beta is greater than 1 then it is more volatile compared to the market  Conversely  a beta below 1 signifies less volatility 
	Now  if a portfolio s beta is 3  it is three times more volatile than the market  Hence  if the market is projected to give 20  return  the portfolio will then definitely contribute 60  return which is amazing 
	However  the opposite case also holds true  If the market slips 20  then the portfolio return plummets 60  which is surely a matter of concern The Winning Strategy
	In our screening criteria we included beta in the range of 0 to 0 6 for short listing low risk stocks  But this can t be the only criterion for betting on stocks  The other parameters that need to be added to create a winning portfolio are Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero   This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5   They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of success 
	Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening B G Foods Inc     is involved in manufacturing and distributing frozen and shelf stable foods along with household products across U S   Canada and Puerto Rico  The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with a positive average surprise of 5 67   For 2016  B G Foods  earnings are projected to improve 38 8  year over year The J  M  Smucker Company     is a leading marketer and manufacturer of consumer food and beverage products and pet food and pet snacks in North America  J  M  Smucker has surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 19 93   For the coming quarter  the company s earnings are expected to grow 29  over the prior year quarter Bristol Myers Squibb Company    is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company with focus on discovering  developing and delivering innovative treatments for serious diseases  It is to be noted that the company surpassed expectations in each the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 27 67   Bristol Myers  projected earnings growth for this year is impressive at 29 5  year over year Pretium Resources Inc      is involved in the exploitation and development of precious metal resources   that include gold  silver  and copper deposits   in the U S  The company posted a positive average earnings surprise of 35 42  for the last four quarters FTI Consulting Inc      provides specialized consulting services across 26 foreign countries with a total headcount of more than 4 200 employees  In three of the last four quarters  the company posted positive earnings surprises with an average beat of 30 96   Moreover  the company s year over year projected earnings growth rate for 2016 is 27 7

The randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy  safety and tolerability of a single dose intratympanic administration of AM 111 in patients suffering from severe to profound ISSNHL within 72 hours from onset 
We note that the first pivotal phase III study   HEALOS   on AM 111 is currently underway in several European and Asian countries  In addition  the company plans to conduct a phase II study  REACH  on the candidate for the treatment of surgery induced hearing loss in the U S

214304,435820,BMY,Zacks Industry Rank Analysis Highlights  Pfizer  Bristol Myers Squibb And H Lundbeck,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 15  2016   Stocks featured in this week s Zacks Industry Rank analysis include Pfizer     Bristol Myers Squibb    and H Lundbeck     

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by John Blank  PhD  Chief Equity Strategist  Zacks com 

Don t Make It Complicated  Own Drug Stocks

Don t make it complicated  The Large Cap Pharma Industry usually looks like a solid investor niche  Place a few of your stock picking bets here 

Here s the latest top down data  which shows what I mean  In mid June  the 15 company strong industry has a Zacks Industry Rank of 44 out of 265  that s the top 17    In recent weeks  covering analysts made 10 positive earnings estimate revisions and just 5 negative revisions to large cap drug stocks  Broad  top down tailwinds like this  I see them nearly every time I look into the pharma industry 

Furthermore  each time I write up the  investor report  the Health Care sector lands in the top 3 or 4 attractive spots out of the 10 S P500 sectors  No other S P 500 sector is as consistently ranked so favorably 

Finally  the portfolio I run at Zacks    the      always attempts to have an overweight position in Health Care  Lots of these drug companies are based outside the USA for tax purposes  Many base operations in Ireland  where the corporate profit tax rates are favorable  Due to patent protection  cash flows are strong and positive on successful drug stocks 

As an investor  not a trader  there are 3 good fundamental reasons to own a drug stock   

 1  Aging demographics in advanced countries like the USA 

Final demand growth is everything behind the sustainability of industry revenue growth  If there is no rain and sun  there will be no green grass  The basic ingredients for rising drug demand   the frailties that accompany aging    are going to be there for the next 2 decades 

 2  Drug stocks can pay a healthy dividend 

Two of the 3 stocks I list  below  offer dividends of 3 7  and 2 07  annually  When the U S  10 year Treasury trades at record lows  that adds a fixed income incentive to these stocks 

 3  Bigger pharma companies in the space buy smaller companies all the time 

That is  more often than not  how the large cap drug companies grow  There is a real chance to score a sizeable merger stock premium  when you hold the right shares of an acquired smaller drug company  The final stock I picked is a smaller  though not too small  drug growth stock based in Denmark

214324,435840,BMY,Agios Reports Favorable Phase II PK Deficiency Study Data,opinion,"Agios Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AGIO   announced encouraging initial data from an ongoing open label phase II study  DRIVE PK  on one of its pipeline candidates  AG 348  for the treatment of patients suffering from pyruvate kinase  PK  deficiency  Data were presented at the Congress of the European Hematology Association 
The study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AG 348 in adult transfusion independent patients with PK deficiency  Results showed that AG 348 achieved proof of concept with nine of 18 total patients  nine of 13 patients with at least one missense mutation  witnessing rapid  robust and sustained hemoglobin increases of  1 0 g dL as of the data cut off  Mar 27  2016   In patients who had such hemoglobin increases  the mean maximum hemoglobin increase was 3 4 g dL and ranged from 2 3 g dL to 4 9 g dL 
Moreover  pharmacokinetics were favorable and consistent with those observed in healthy volunteers  On the safety front  AG 348 was found to be well tolerated with none of the patients discontinuing treatment early and the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate  Grade 1 2  and temporary 
On the back of the favorable phase II study results  the company plans to move the candidate into late stage development  Per the company s press release  PK deficiency is a rare  debilitating  congenital anemia  Currently  there is no approved therapy to treat the underlying cause of PK deficiency

214325,435841,BMY,Forget Growth  Focus On Earnings Beat With These 4 Stocks ,opinion,"Equity investors hold their breath before an earnings release  This is because earnings supposedly determine the company s financial health  No wonder  solid earnings growth speaks about business well being  but there is another metric which works better in determining the future direction of stock price  i e  positive earnings surprise or earnings beat  Let s tell you why it is so important 
What is Earnings Beat 
Investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with a stellar performance  After much brainstorming  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  These estimates act as investment leads 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
Why Earnings Beat is Superior to Earnings Growth 
A 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent a decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into the play sometimes  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  analysts put together their insights and a company s guidance when giving an earnings estimate  Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as market perception  Of course  this gives you a clear picture of the company s bottom line  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release 
How to Find Stocks that Can Beat 
Now  since it is difficult to predict if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings season  investors can check the earnings surprise history  An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only companies with a Strong Buy rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity  we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrows down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around six 
Here are four of the six stocks that passed the screen 
Tallgrass Energy GP LP   NYSE TEGP     The partnership is a contributor of crude transportation services in Wyoming and adjoining areas  It has a VGM score of  A  and expected EPS growth rate of 90 6  for this year 
PharMerica Corporation   NYSE PMC    This is an institutional pharmacy services company that sports a VGM score of  A   The company s estimated earnings growth rate for this year is 31 9  
Dave   Buster s Entertainment Inc    NASDAQ PLAY    The company   with a VGM score of  A    owns and operates dining and entertainment venues  Its estimated earnings growth rate for this year is 29 21  
Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY    The company   with a VGM score of  F    makes  markets  and sells biopharmaceutical products globally  Its estimated earnings growth rate for this year is 29 5

214328,435844,BMY,Don t Make It Complicated  Own Drug Stocks,opinion,"Don t make it complicated  The Large Cap Pharma Industry usually looks like a solid investor niche  Place a few of your stock picking bets here 
Here s the latest top down data  which shows what I mean  In mid June  the 15 company strong industry has a Zacks Industry Rank of 44 out of 265  that s the top 17    In recent weeks  covering analysts made 10 positive earnings estimate revisions and just 5 negative revisions to large cap drug stocks  Broad  top down tailwinds like this  I see them nearly every time I look into the pharma industry 
Furthermore  each time I write up the  investor report  the Health Care sector lands in the top 3 or 4 attractive spots out of the 10 S P500 sectors  No other S P 500 sector is as consistently ranked so favorably  
Finally  the portfolio I run at Zacks    the     always attempts to have an overweight position in Health Care  Lots of these drug companies are based outside the USA for tax purposes  Many base operations in Ireland  where the corporate profit tax rates are favorable  Due to patent protection  cash flows are strong and positive on successful drug stocks 
As an investor  not a trader  there are 3 good fundamental reasons to own a drug stock   
 1  Aging demographics in advanced countries like the USA  
Final demand growth is everything behind the sustainability of industry revenue growth  If there is no rain and sun  there will be no green grass  The basic ingredients for rising drug demand   the frailties that accompany aging    are going to be there for the next 2 decades 
 2  Drug stocks can pay a healthy dividend 
Two of the 3 stocks I list  below  offer dividends of 3 7  and 2 07  annually  When the U S  10 year Treasury trades at record lows  that adds a fixed income incentive to these stocks 
 3  Bigger pharma companies in the space buy smaller companies all the time 
That is  more often than not  how the large cap drug companies grow  There is a real chance to score a sizeable merger stock premium  when you hold the right shares of an acquired smaller drug company  The final stock I picked is a smaller  though not too small  drug growth stock based in Denmark

214346,435862,BMY,AstraZeneca Presents Tagrisso Leptomeningeal Disease Data,opinion,"AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   presented clinical and safety data from a phase I study  BLOOM  on its lung cancer drug  Tagrisso  osimertinib   in patients with leptomeningeal  LM  disease at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
Updated results showed that Tagrisso  160 mg once daily  demonstrated activity through assessments with MRI imaging intracranial response irrespective of the T790M mutation status of patients  Additionally  Tagrisso crossed the blood brain barrier  The drug resulted in a decline in central nervous system lesions in patients with LM disease in addition to neurological improvement  Moreover  Tagrisso demonstrated a manageable tolerability profile over a treatment period of up to 11 months 
Per the company s press release  LM disease is a complication of epidermal growth factor receptor  EGFR  mutation positive advanced non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   where cancer cells spread to the cerebrospinal fluid  LM disease affects roughly 5  of patients with NSCLC and nearly 9  of those with EGFRm NSCLC 
Considering that the treatment of LM disease is difficult  the safety  tolerability and activity profile that Tagrisso has demonstrated is promising 
We note that Tagrisso  80 mg once daily  gained accelerated approval in Nov 2015 for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC  as detected by an FDA approved test  who have progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy  It is also approved for the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M mutation positive locally advanced metastatic NSCLC in the EU 
Currently  Tagrisso is also being evaluated in the adjuvant setting and in the metastatic first line setting  including patients with brain metastases  as well as in combination with other treatments

The advisory committees also backed Vantrela s labeling as an abuse deterrent product by the oral  14 to 3   nasal  14 to 3  and intravenous  16 to 1  routes of abuse  subject to approval 
Vantrela  which is an extended release formulation of hydrocodone bitartrate  has been developed utilizing the company s proprietary abuse deterrence technology  Teva expects that Vantrela s label  upon approval  will carry a description regarding the product s abuse deterrent properties that are likely to reduce  but not fully prevent  abuse of the drug when the tablets are manipulated  based on the committees  votes 
We note that the FDA generally takes the advisory committees  recommendation into consideration when reviewing candidates but is not bound by the same  With the panels in favor of approving Vantrela  we believe chances of gaining FDA approval are high 
We note that Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE    which is also seeking FDA approval for its pain drug Troxyca ER  oxycodone and naltrexone   is expected to come up before the advisory committees today

214363,435879,BMY,AstraZeneca Sells Zurampic s EU And Latin American Rights,opinion,"AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   announced that it has entered into a licensing agreement with Gr nenthal GmbH under which the latter will gain exclusive rights to the gout drug Zurampic  lesinurad  of the former in the EU  Switzerland  Iceland  Norway and Lichtenstein  and in all Latin American countries including Mexico  the Dominican Republic and Cuba 
Gr nenthal will also gain exclusive rights to the fixed dose combination of Zurampic and allopurinol in these markets  Moreover  Gr nenthal will seek approval for this combination  which is currently under development 
The deal will see AstraZeneca receiving sales and other related milestone payments of up to  230 million over the life of the contract plus tiered  low double digit royalties on annual product sales  AstraZeneca will initially manufacture and supply Zurampic to Gr nenthal and undertake the European post approval commitment on Gr nenthal s behalf  Gr nenthal will have the option to take over manufacturing of Zurampic  beginning Oct 1  2021 
We note that Zurampic was approved in the EU in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor  for the adjunctive treatment of hyperuricemia  excess of uric acid in the blood  in adults with uncontrolled gout in Feb 2016 
Meanwhile  revenues from the licensing agreement are expected to provide AstraZeneca with recurring externalisation revenue from any expected milestone payments and tiered  low double digit percent royalty payments on product sales  However  the agreement is not expected to impact AstraZeneca s financial guidance for 2016 
Zurampic s U S  Rights to Ironwood Completed
In a separate press release  AstraZeneca announced that it has completed the licensing agreement granting Ironwood Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ IRWD   the exclusive U S  rights to Zurampic  Ironwood also gained the rights to a fixed dose combination of Zurampic and allopurinol  which is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval in the second half of 2016 
The divestment of Zurampic will allow AstraZeneca to focus on selected core therapeutic areas  Considering that several products in the company s portfolio went off patent putting pressure on its top line  the company needs to expedite the development of its pipeline

214364,435880,BMY,Regeneron  Sanofi Report Positive Dupilumab Phase III Data,opinion,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ REGN   and Sanofi   NYSE SNY   announced encouraging long term data from a phase III  LIBERTY AD CHRONOS  study evaluating dupilumab with topical corticosteroids  TCS  versus TCS alone in inadequately controlled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD  patients 
Results demonstrated that dupilumab with TCS significantly improved measures of overall disease severity at 16 and 52 weeks when compared to placebo with TCS  thereby meeting both primary and key secondary endpoints  respectively 
Primary endpoint results at week 16 showed that 39  of patients who received dupilumab  either 300 mg weekly or 300 mg every two weeks  with TCS witnessed clearing or near clearing of skin lesions compared to 12  of patients in the placebo with TCS arm  Additionally  64  of patients on dupilumab 300 mg weekly with TCS and 69  of patients on dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI 75 compared to 23  of patients receiving placebo with TCS  Moreover  it was found that patients in the dupilumab with TCS groups were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to patients in the placebo with TCS group 
As per the companies  press release  a regulatory application in the U S   which is planned for the third quarter of 2016  will include these data in addition to previously reported data from phase III studies 
We note that positive top line data from two phase III studies   LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and SOLO 2   evaluating dupilumab as a monotherapy in adults with inadequately controlled moderate to severe AD were announced in Apr 2016 
Considering that there are roughly 1 6 million patients in the U S  who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe AD  and are currently being treated but are still living with inadequately controlled disease  its approval would be a huge boost for the patient population and both companies 
We note that dupilumab enjoys Breakthrough Therapy status in the U S  for the treatment of AD  This designation should expedite the development and review process of the candidate 
Apart from AD  dupilumab is also being evaluated for additional inflammatory indications including asthma and nasal polyposis

214365,435881,BMY,Roche Presents Encouraging Data On Actemra And Tecentriq,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced positive results from the phase III study  GiACTA  on arthritis drug  Actemra RoActemra 
The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints as data showed that Actemra  initially combined with a six month steroid  glucocorticoid  regimen  was more effective in sustaining remission through one year as compared to a 6  or 12 month steroid only regimen in people with newly diagnosed and relapsing giant cell arteritis  GCA  
Given that high dose steroids are the mainstay treatment for GCA despite being associated with serious adverse effects  an approval for Actemra would provide much needed alternative to patients with GCA 
We note that Actemra is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis  RA  in both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations 
Roche s immunology portfolio currently comprises drugs like MabThera Rituxan and Actemra for RA  Xolair for asthma  Pulmozyme for cystic fibrosis and Esbriet for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  IPF   along with a promising pipeline that includes etrolizumab for inflammatory bowel disease  and lebrikizumab for severe asthma  atopic dermatitis and IPF 
Roche also announced that its immune oncology  Tecentriq  atezolizumab   was effective in shrinking tumors in patients with previously untreated advanced bladder cancer  as observed in a phase II study  IMvigor210 
Last month  the drug was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
Roche presented additional data on Tecentriq at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology  Initial data on Tecentriq  in combination with Exelixis    NASDAQ EXEL   Cotellic  showed that the drug was well tolerated  with responses observed regardless of the Programmed Death Ligand 1  PD L1  expression in patients suffering from advanced colorectal cancer in a phase Ib study 
A phase Ib study among patients with triple negative breast cancer  mTNBC  showed that Tecentriq in combination with Abraxane chemotherapy showed durable responses occurring across all lines of therapy  The safety profile was similar to that previously seen with Tecentriq or Abraxane chemotherapy alone  A dose finding study of Tecentriq in combination with anti OX40 treatment  MOXR0916  showed a favorable safety profile and evidence of immune activation in an ongoing phase Ib study 
Roche also presented updated survival data from the phase II study POPLAR on Tecentriq in patients with previously treated advanced non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   wherein the drug showed an increasing overall survival benefit in patients 
We remind investors that the FDA has accepted the company s Biologics License Application  BLA  and granted priority review to Tecentriq for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC  whose disease expresses the protein PD L1 as determined by an FDA approved test  and who have progressed on or after platinum containing chemotherapy  A decision by the FDA is expected by Oct 19  2016 
We expect investors to focus on new drug approvals at Roche  as the company s top line could be marred by the entry of biosimilars for its key drugs  expected in the second half of 2017 in Europe  like MabThera and Herceptin

214383,435899,BMY,Teva s Huntington Disease Drug Receives CRL From The FDA,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA   suffered a regulatory setback with the FDA issuing a complete response letter  CRL  for the new drug application for SD 809  deutetrabenazine  for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease  HD  
In its CRL  the FDA has asked Teva to re analyze blood levels of certain metabolites  Teva noted that these metabolites are not novel and are also observed in patients taking tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine  Importantly  the regulatory agency did not ask the company to conduct additional studies 
Teva plans to work closely with the FDA to address the issue  A response to the CRL will be submitted in the third quarter of 2016 
Although the CRL on SD 809 comes as a disappointment for Teva  the most important thing is that the FDA has not asked the company for additional studies to be conducted  which would have delayed the candidate from entering the U S  markets further 
Per the company s press release  HD is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately one in 7 000 10 000 people in western countries  While chorea is one of the most prominent physical manifestations of this disease  it occurs in roughly 90  of patients at some point in the course of their illness 
Notably  SD 809 is the first deuterated product to be reviewed by the FDA  Considering the lack of treatments for HD  its approval will be a huge boost for the patient population as well as for the company 
We note that SD 809 became a part of Teva s pipeline following the May 2015 acquisition of Auspex Pharmaceuticals

214403,435919,BMY,AbbVie Boehringer Report Crohn s Disease Drug Interim Data,opinion,"AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV   and Boehringer Ingelheim announced that interim results were presented from a randomized  placebo controlled  proof of concept phase II study evaluating intravenous risankizumab  IL 23 inhibitor  200 mg and 600 mg  versus placebo administered at weeks zero  four  and eight in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn s disease  Data were presented at the Digestive Disease Week 
Results showed that 24  and 37  of patients achieved clinical remission with 200 mg and 600 mg risankizumab  respectively  compared with the placebo arm  15   after 12 weeks  Additionally  endoscopic remission was achieved by 15  and 20  of patients who received 200 mg and 600 mg risankizumab  respectively  compared with 3  of patients who received placebo  Moreover  almost twice as many patients achieved a clinical response with risankizumab  37  and 42  in the 200 mg and 600 mg groups  respectively   compared with the placebo group  21   at week 12 
On the safety front  risankizumab was found to be well tolerated in the study with numerically fewer severe or serious adverse events being reported in patients when treated with risankizumab compared to placebo 
Considering that patients with moderate to severe Crohn s disease who have failed anti TNF therapy have inadequate choices for treatment  the interim data are encouraging  The study is currently in progress and will evaluate patients up to 52 weeks 
In Mar 2016  AbbVie and Boehringer had announced a collaboration agreement under which the former is responsible for the development and commercialization of risankizumab globally  Apart from Crohn s disease  risankizumab is also being evaluated for a couple of other immunological disorders including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
Upon successful development and subsequent approval  risankizumab will enter a high potential but immensely crowded market given the presence of drugs like Stelara  Cosentyx and Enbrel among others

The multi center  open label  randomized  controlled study was conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety profile of Relvar Ellipta with existing COPD usual care  including long acting muscarinic antagonists  long acting beta2 agonists  and inhaled corticosteroids administered as monotherapy  dual or triple combinations 
Results showed that patients when treated with Relvar Ellipta achieved a superior reduction in exacerbations compared to usual care in an everyday clinical practice setting  For the primary effectiveness analysis  a statistically significant reduction  8 41   in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared with those receiving usual care was found in patients treated with Relvar Ellipta  In the intent to treat population  the incidence of serious adverse events was found to be similar between the two groups   Relvar Ellipta  29   and usual care  27   
While analyses will continue  a second Salford Lung Study is currently being conducted in asthma patients with data expected in 2017 
We note that Relvar Ellipta is approved in Europe for the symptomatic treatment of adults with COPD with FEV1 70  predicted normal  post bronchodilator  with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator therapy 
The drug is marketed as Breo Ellipta in the U S  for the long term  once daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD  including chronic bronchitis and or emphysema and to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations  Relvar Breo Ellipta registered sales of  257 million in 2015

214406,435922,BMY,Sanofi s Diabetes Drug Combination Wins FDA Panel Backing,opinion,"Positive news flowed in for Sanofi  PA SASY    NYSE SNY   when the FDA s Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee  EMDAC  voted in favor  12 to 2  of an approval of the company s new drug application for the fixed ratio combination of its diabetes drugs   Lantus  basal insulin glargine  100 units mL  and Lyxumia  GLP 1 receptor agonist  lixisenatide    for the treatment of type II diabetes in adults 
The recommendation came as a surprise given the concerns raised in the briefing documents released by the FDA ahead of the panel meeting  read more     Nevertheless  the EMDAC s opinion will now be reviewed by the FDA  with a final response expected in Aug 2016  With the panel in favor of approving the fixed ratio combination  we believe chances of gaining an FDA approval are high 
The company submitted a regulatory application for the combination in the EU in Mar 2016  Meanwhile  a final decision from the FDA regarding Lyxumia s approval status is expected in Jul 2016  We note that Lyxumia is already approved in the EU 
Sanofi s Diabetes segment has been under pressure of late  with Lantus facing pricing pressure in the U S   and biosimilar competition in the EU and Japan  The company expects global Diabetes sales to decline 4 8  annually over the 2015 2018 time frame 
Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  A S   NYSE NVO   is also looking to get an FDA approval for its combination treatment  IDegLira  for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes  The company has received a favorable opinion from the EMDAC  IDegLira is a once daily  fixed combination of Tresiba  insulin degludec  and Victoza  liraglutide  
Update on the Medivation Takeover
Sanofi remains focused on acquiring Medivation  Inc    NASDAQ MDVN   even after the latter rejected an unsolicited offer of  52 50 per share  approximately  9 3 billion  in cash late last month  citing that it significantly undervalued the company 
In a recent development  Sanofi announced that it has filed preliminary consent solicitation materials with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   seeking approval to remove and replace each member of Medivation s board of directors with candidates who will be open to this transaction 
Following the SEC approval  Sanofi will make the definitive consent solicitation statement available to Medivation shareholders  so that they may begin delivering written consents to Sanofi s proposal 
However  Medivation has urged its shareholders to thwart Sanofi s efforts to replace the company s entire board of directors and expects to file consent revocation materials with the SEC promptly 
While speculations are rife about other companies being interested in acquiring Medivation  Sanofi was the only one to make an official proposal 
We expect investors focus to remain on further updates on this transaction

The decline in both R D and G A expenses was due to restructuring initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016  respectively 
Merger in Focus
Last month  Synta announced that it will be merging with a privately held company  Madrigal Pharmaceuticals  Inc   in an all stock transaction  This combined company will focus on the development of novel small molecule drugs targeting cardiovascular metabolic diseases and non alcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  
MGL 3196  which is Madrigal s lead candidate  is a phase II ready candidate that is being evaluated for the treatment of NASH and heterozygous as well as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia Once the proposed merger closes  Madrigal shareholders will own 64  of the combined company while Synta shareholders will own 36   The merger is slated to close in the third quarter of 2016 
We note that Synta had earlier focused on cancer treatments but the company suffered a setback last year when it decided to terminate a phase III study  GALAXY 2  on its lead pipeline candidate ganetespib  advanced non small cell lung adenocarcinoma  due to futility  Thereafter  the company discontinued a substantial portion of its R D activities relating to ganetespib and its oncology pipeline

Going ahead  we believe investor focus will remain on updates from the Madrigal transaction

AVEO does not have any approved product in its portfolio  The company recognizes revenues in the form of collaboration revenues  milestone and other payments  The company s total collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2016 was  1 2 million  up from  0 1 million in the year ago quarter  Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 million 
Higher collaboration revenues were primarily attributable to  1 million in revenue recognized in the reported quarter related to the company s out licensing agreement with CANbridge Life Sciences  which was carried out in Mar 2016 
Quarterly Details
Research   development expenses shot up almost 122  year over year to roughly  6 million  mainly due to the preparation of a phase III study on tivozanib 
General and administrative expenses decreased 24 3  year over year to  2 5 million  The decline was mainly due to a decrease in external legal costs associated with various ongoing legal matters  and a decrease in employee compensation  consulting  facilities and IT costs as a result of reduction in headcount and utilized facility space following the Jan 2015 restructuring 
During the quarter  AVEO s European partner  EUSA Pharma  announced that it has submitted and received a validation notice for the marketing authorization application that was filed with the European Medicines Agency for tivozanib for the first line treatment of renal cell carcinoma  RCC  
AVEO is presently working toward the commencement of patient enrollment in a pivotal phase III study  TIVO 3  on tivozanib for the first  and third line treatment of patients with RCC  which is expected in the current quarter  The company also intends to conduct a phase I II study on tivozanib in combination with a PD 1 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with RCC 
The company is looking for partnerships to fund the clinical and regulatory development of tivozanib in North America  including TIVO 3 and a PD1 combination study 
As far as other pipeline candidates are concerned  AVEO entered into a collaboration and license agreement in Mar 2016 granting CANbridge the exclusive right to develop  manufacture and commercialize AVEO s clinical stage ErbB3  HER3  inhibitory antibody candidate  AV 203  CANbridge plans to develop AV 203 first for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell cancer 
Meanwhile  the company is currently seeking a partner for the global development and commercialization of its potent inhibitory antibody specific to Notch 3   AV 353   for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
AVEO continues to expect its cash resources to fund its current operations into the fourth quarter of 2017 
Our Take
AVEO s performance in the first quarter was decent with its loss coming in line with expectation and revenues surpassing it  The company s progress with its lead pipeline candidate tivozanib is encouraging  Moreover  the company s focus on exploring partnerships for the development of tivozanib and AV 353 is also encouraging  We expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates from the company

Total revenues in the reported quarter soared 81  year over year to  204 7 million driven by strong growth across all three of its business units   Primary Care  Orphan and Rheumatology  Reported revenues were however below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  226 9 million Horizon Pharma s shares were up 13 9  following the release of first quarter results Quarterly DetailsPrimary Care revenues increased 39  to  111 million  driven by a 94  year over year improvement in total prescriptions due to strong performance of Pennsaid 2   up a substantial 201  to  55 million   However  both Duexis and Vimovo declined almost 51  and 45 7  sequentially to  29 6 million and  25 5 million  respectively  The decline was due to seasonality and increased control by certain pharmacy benefit managers and payors Migergot recorded sales of  0 9 million in the reported quarter The Orphan unit recorded revenues of  66 3 million  The unit includes sales of Ravicti  Actimmune and Buphenyl  Actimmune sales in the first quarter were  25 5 million  up 3  year over year  While Ravicti generated sales of  37 1 million  up 7 5  sequentially  Buphenyl contributed  3 7 million to total revenues  down almost 34  sequentially  We note that both Ravicti and Buphenyl became a part of company s portfolio as a result of the May 2015 Hyperion Therapeutics acquisition The Rheumatology unit  comprising Krystexxa  Rayos and Lodotra  generated sales of  27 4 million  up 232  from the year ago period  Krystexxa sales in the first quarter came in at  16 2 million  While Rayos revenues shot up 46  to  10 5 million  Lodotra revenues plummeted 33  to  0 7 million We note that both Migergot and Krystexxa became part of the company s portfolio as a result of the Jan 2016 Crealta Holdings acquisition Adjusted research   development expenses increased 53 6  year over year to  8 6 million  Adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 76 3  to  34 9 million  Adjusted sales and marketing expenses increased 58  to  69 7 million 
2016 Guidance Maintained
Horizon Pharma reiterated its net sales and adjusted EBITDA expectations for the second quarter and full year 2016  The company continues to expect net sales in the range of  1 025 billion to  1 050 billion  representing year over year growth of 37  at the midpoint  It still expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of  505 million to  520 million  representing year over year growth of 41  at the midpoint  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  1 03 billion 
While 22 23  of net sales are still expected to come in the second quarter of 2016  the company projects 57 59  of net sales in the second half of 2016 
As far as adjusted EBITDA is concerned  the company continues to expect 21 22  to come in the second quarter of 2016  It expects to pick up pace in the second half of 2016 by reporting adjusted EBITDA of 64 66  
The company s board of directors has also authorized a  5 million share repurchase program 
Pipeline Update
Patient enrolment in a phase III study  STEADFAST  on Actimmune for the treatment of Friedreich s ataxia was completed this month  Data is anticipated by the end of 2016  Positive results from the study would allow the company to file a supplemental biologics license application in the first quarter of 2017 
Actimmune is also being evaluated in combination with a PD 1 checkpoint inhibitor  Bristol Myers Squibb Company s   NYSE BMY   Opdivo  in a investigator initiated phase I study for the treatment of both kidney and bladder cancer 
Meanwhile  the company expects to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA for Ravicti for the treatment of urea cycle disorders in children aged two months to two years in the current quarter 
Our Take
Horizon Pharma missed both top and bottom line estimates in the first quarter  Nevertheless  the performance of the company s  business units was impressive during the quarter  The company is working on label expansion of Actimmune and Ravicti  which is encouraging  Horizon Pharma has been actively pursuing acquisitions to expand and diversify its portfolio and  following management s hints  we could see some merger   acquisition activities at the company

214478,435994,BMY,Top Trade Ideas  Week Of August 10  2015,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  is headquartered in the heart of midtown  on Park Avenue in New York City  Not exactly where you would expect to see a company that discovers  develops  licenses  manufactures  markets  distributes and sells biopharmaceuticals world wide  Or maybe it is with a market cap of over  100 billion 
Over the last 9 months since the stock price up off of its moving averages  it has found rising trend support  moving the range higher  That is until last week  Thursday it broke down below that trend line and Friday continued  It comes into the week sitting on its 200 day SMA  where it has not been since that move up began in October 
It also printed a Hammer candlestick Friday though  This can be a sign of a reversal  when it is confirmed by a higher close the next day  in this case Monday  The RSI is now in the bearish zone and the MACD is falling  These support more downside price action 
Which way will it go  a continuation lower  or a reversal higher  I do not know  but there is resistance above at 64 25 and 66 followed by 69 25 and 70 50  Support lower may show up at 62 50 and 60 75 followed by 58 85 and 57 50 
The options chains show weekly contracts out to September 25th and then monthly contracts  The open interest on the weekly options is sizable at the 63 Put Strike  near the current price  But it is twice as big at the 71 5 Call Strike  The August monthly Expiry sees enormous open interest at the 70 Call Strike  The company is expected to report earnings next October 22nd and the short interest is low under 2  

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 64 with a stop at 62  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the August 64 Calls  offered at  1 00 late Friday   A defined risk method of participating in the stock price move 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the August 63 64 bullish Risk Reversal  4 cents   Adds leverage to the options trade 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad market macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week sees the news and earnings dry up and Equities could use some quiet time to steady 
Elsewhere look for a possible bounce out of gold in its downtrend while crude oil continues lower  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to consolidate with an upward bias while US Treasuries continue higher  The Shanghai Composite remains in broad consolidation in the pullback while Emerging Markets look like they may break a 4 year range to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  despite the moves lower  Their charts show further short term weakness possible but the Hammer candles could confirm a short term bottom  On the longer timeframe The IWM remains weakest with the SPY consolidating and the QQQ looking strong  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Amicus Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ FOLD  had a good day on Monday  popping out of a wedge  up 99 cents  or 17 4   on 5 9 million shares  That s very good volume for this stock  If it follows through on Tuesday  I m looking for it to take out the 7 1 2 area  8 dollars  and then 9 dollars as my targets

214530,436046,BMY,In A Market That Won t Quit  Ideas For Swing Traders,opinion,"The market just keeps pressing higher  I know the market is long in the tooth  but it just won t quit  and until we get a decisive turn down we ll keep playing the long side  Although swing traders might make some money on the short side on some of the Boxer Shorts 
Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY  may not be done consolidating  but it is pushing the upper end of the flag  It s something to keep an eye on  It traded 67 million shares on Tuesday  and was up about a half percent  Nothing great  but I did want to show you that it s set up to make a move here 
Integrated Device Technology  Inc   NASDAQ IDTI  swing trader popped 82 cents  or 4 76   on 3 2 million shares  and you can see the pullback opportunity here to support the bottom trendline  and now it s popping  The highs over the last week or so were 18 35  and now Tuesday s high is at 18 31  If it can get up through this area  you may see this stock run some more  The eventual target is in the 21 range 
NewLink Genetics Corporation  NASDAQ NLNK  swing trade is acting well  You can see in the last couple weeks the pullback  and on Tuesday the snapback  up 1 75  or 5 6   on 880 200 shares traded  That s not spectacular volume  but the technicals look like they re about to turnaround  Moving averages have held and so has price support  This would be the logical place for this to take off  The first target is set at 35 35 1 2  the second target 38 39  Ultimately  I m looking for a big move to retest the highs in the low 40 s 
Vimicro International Corp   NASDAQ VIMC  has been a little slow  I have been waiting a month for this stock to get going  It had a big move  They say the bigger the move  the bigger the consolidation  Yet it s a bullish looking move  Kind of a wedge pattern  It has a falling wedge within a larger wedge  Either way  it s a consolidation pattern that if taken out could explode  On Tuesday  it did pop 35 cents  or 4   on 477 700  It needs to get some extension with more volume  Keep an eye on this one because if it does start to move  it could quickly test 11 11 1 2 range  maybe 11 3 4 range  and then it s off to the races at 11 90 12 00  perhaps into the 13 15 zone

Alibaba Group Holdings  NYSE BABA  is a recent IPO  After the IPO pop  it came down from the 109 range to the low 80s  towards the 82 81 low  In a week and a half it s gone up from there to Monday s high of 98 85  up 2 03  or 2   on 28 million shares  It has been up 8 out of 9 days  There s a possibility of two or three things  and either it pulls back  or it blows through it  As early as Tuesday  this stock may pop  and with a lot of companies coming out with recommendations of 120 125 targets  It could extend  Keep an eye on it  If it gets above the 97 99 area  it may start to run a couple points 
Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY   which I ve been hearing fundamentally  but from a technical standpoint I saw the breakout of a beautiful base that took six months to develop  Such a short move requires some sort of pullback consolidation  which may have begun on Monday  It was only off a dime  The volume increased a little bit  I just think that if that stock pulls back in this zone and consolidates  it s headed to much higher levels  First  a retest of the early year s high at the 57 range  and if it gets through that  we could see 63ish  Those are the targets 
Cyber Ark Software Ltd   NASDAQ CYBR  had an excellent day on Monday  Always look at an IPO on a 15 minute basis for more chart data  This stock backed and filled for three weeks  or so  and broke out over the last couple sessions  You can see a spike up  it reached the post IPO high at 35 88  and on Monday  it spiked up again  up 4 84  or 16   on 3 9 million shares  The short term target on this one is 39 40 
ReWalk Robotics Ltd   NASDAQ RWLK  also had a good day on Monday  up 3 18  or 12   on 506 700 shares traded  It came out and popped  and then drifted down from the declining channel  Two declining top lines were broken  and it punched through the moving averages  Watch resistance at 30  it may reach that Tuesday morning  Between 30 31 1 2 are scalp targets  but my swing trade target is mid 30 s  around 35

214576,436092,BMY,Multiple Near Term Catalysts And Bullish Chart Point To A Higher Stock,opinion,Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp   SNTA  is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases  The company has two drug candidates in clinical trials for treating multiple types of cancer and various drug candidates in the preclinical stage of development  Its oncology product portfolio includes Ganetespib  an Hsp90 inhibitor in Phase 2b 3 clinical trial for various types of cancers including non small cell lung cancer Also in development is elesclomol  a mitochondria targeting agent in Phase II clinical trials for ovarian cancer and Phase 1 clinical trial for acute myeloid leukemia  STA 9584  a vascular disrupting agent is also in preclinical development for prostate cancer  After researching Synta  I feel this is a rare company where the sky is the limit if its potential is reached  For now  it may be a company whose stock will be good to trade based on several catalysts  Eventually  it is possible for Synta to be a huge revenue producer  Let s get into the reasons why  I would like to start off with what the company refers to as its Galaxy trial  In September  Synta  an update from an interim analysis of the Phase IIb portion of this trial  It is a Phase IIb III study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the company s lead Hsp90 inhibitor  Ganetespib  as second line treatment for advanced non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  The results showed good tolerability for the combination of Ganetespib and docetaxel which was presented by the company at ASCO this year  In addition  there were meaningful improvements in overall survival in patients receiving this combination compared to those receiving docetaxel alone  I found a  from the company very interesting with regards to the Galaxy trial  Synta spoke about the development of the Hsp90 inhibitors which is focused on in this study  Its drug  ganetepsib  is a second generation hsp90 inhibitor which is showing a significantly better safety profile compared to the first generation inhibitors  The first generation displays a lack of strength treating the cancer while being toxic in the liver  Meanwhile  ganetepsib has shown 10 100x more potency  a low molecular weight  and the absence of serious liver or common ocular toxicities  Some characteristics of the upcoming study are as follows    Number of patients to be enrolled   500   Treatment population   Stage IIIB IV non small cell lung cancer  adenocarcinoma   Primary endpoint   overall survival The company expects to complete enrollment and begin the trial by the end of this year  and expects a mature data set in the first half of 2013  The timeline detailed in the above referenced presentation shows the final data from the Phase III trial in the first half of 2014  Many people have been asking Safi Bahcall  the CEO  about accelerated approval possibilities and trying to speed up the process of getting this drug to the market  I was very impressed by his response where he firmly specified the goals in this trial  They are acquiring a very rich data set which can make the Phase III trial very complete and without any problems  The goal is the big picture and extending the survival of the patients  The best way to demonstrate this is in Phase III  The primary goal of Phase II is noted on one of the company s slides   De risking Phase III   In general  I don t really like to write about cancer companies unless I really find something that separates them from the others  In this case  a comment from the CEO made me start to actually think this company could be reaching new heights in cancer research  Mr  Bahcall said one physician spoke to him noting they have something  incredibly valuable   and have a  huge responsibility  to get this drug to patients  It was very clear by the comments made that Synta truly believes they have something very exciting in the works  Synta notes that the response rate is currently only 8 9  in patients that ganetepsib could hopefully serve once approved  When this happens  the expectation is for a much higher number  It is a highly unmet need  In addition  for the seven highly populated countries that could benefit from ganetepsib  160 000 new patients need treatment each year  A drug currently used for treatment in combination with chemotherapy for lung cancer is bevacizumab  This drug was initially approved in 2004 but has not been without issues  At one point bevacizumab was approved for  by the FDA  but the approval was revoked in November 2011  The approval was revoked because  although there was evidence that it slowed progression of metastatic breast cancer  there was no evidence that it extended life or improved quality of life  It also caused adverse effects including severe high blood pressure and hemorrhaging  In 2008  the FDA gave bevacizumab provisional approval for metastatic breast cancer  subject to further studies  In July 2010  after new studies failed to show a significant benefit  the FDA s advisory panel recommended against the indication for advanced breast cancer  The manufacturing company Genentech requested a hearing  which was granted in June 2011  The FDA ruled to withdraw the breast cancer indication in November 2011  Doctors may sometimes prescribe it for that indication  although insurance companies are less likely to pay for it  The drug remains approved for breast cancer use in other countries including Australia  Another upcoming catalyst for Synta Pharmaceutical is the expected results from its Phase I compassionate use trial  where a single patient  with Elesclomol  The study was designed as a dose escalation of elesclomol sodium in a single patient with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia  AML   The primary objectives of the study are to characterize safety  tolerability  and pharmacokinetics  Elesclomol is a first in class  investigational drug candidate that triggers programmed cell death  apoptosis   in cancer cells through a novel mechanism  disrupting cancer cell energy metabolism by selectively targeting the electron transport chain in cancer cell mitochondria  Elesclomol initially was developed in a partnership with GlaxoSmithKline  GSK   It was given fast track and orphan drug status from the FDA in 2008 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  Synta Pharmaceuticals announced on February 26  2009 the suspension of all clinical trials involving elesclomol due to safety concerns  In March 2010  Synta announced that the FDA had approved resuming its clinical development  In a small  randomized Phase II study  elesclomol was shown to significantly increase  in people with metastatic melanoma when given in addition to paclitaxel  Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapy developed by Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   One company looking for similar leukemia treatment is one I ve written about in the past  Ariad Pharma  ARIA   This company s stock price has soared over the last three years from about  0 45 to over  25 on speculation that its lead drug candidate  Ponatinib will be very successful  Ponatinib  a BCR ABL inhibitor  is designed for heavily pretreated patients with resistant or refractory chronic myeloid leukemia  CML   or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia  Ph  ALL   While the chemical make up of elesclomol is different than Ariad s Ponatinib  the end goal remains common which is to help people with CML  While Elesclomol is in the early stage of testing here  any company that has a potential treatment for CML and other various cancers tends to garner a good deal of speculation value  Another catalyst event for the company is the preliminary results from the Phase II CHIARA trial  expected by the end of this year  The trial is evaluating Ganetespib monotherapy for the treatment of ALK  anaplastic lymphoma kinase    NSCLC patients not previously treated with a direct ALK inhibitor such as crizotinib  The CHIARA  CHaperone Inhibition in Alk Rearranged lung cAncer  trial is a single arm  Phase II study evaluating Ganetespib monotherapy in patients with Stage IIIB IV non small cell lung cancer harboring an ALK gene rearrangement and who have not been previously treated with a direct ALK inhibitor  The primary endpoint of the study is objective response rate  Finally  data from Phase II proof of concept trial of single agent Ganetespib in HER2  or triple negative breast cancer patients is expected in by the end of this year as well  Some insiders appear to like the prospects of their company  as they have been buying lately  The stock has a  18 25 price target from the Point and Figure chart  and six analyst buy ratings  one neutral rating and 0 sell ratings with an average target price of  10 80  As insiders and traders seem to be positioning themselves for a nice entry point lately  short sellers seem to be sleeping at the wheel with Synta  Because the stock has a relatively low float  a surge of buying volume is likely to cause a nice short squeeze here   The chart above shows a positive MACD convergence and strong trend line support  The stock is now wedged in a tight ranged pennant  Any significant buying volume will break out the stock as high as  9 50  retesting the 52 week highs  My 4 to 6 week Price target opinion is  9 50    10 My longer term target is uncertain as we need to see how all these programs goals turn out  If positive  then a price over  30 in 5 years is possible  Disclosure  I am long  SNTA  ,2012-12-11,Scott

214577,436093,BMY,Big Potential In Cancer Immunotherapy,opinion,One of the new trends in the development of cancer therapy has been the involvement of the body s immune system  which is our primary defense mechanism against disease  The general idea is to develop new therapies that direct our immune system response against cancer cells  which results in their destruction through a natural and highly effective system  In stark contrast is chemotherapy  which is today s standard of care for most cancer patients  Chemotherapy is a poison that destroys normal and cancer cells in the hopes that most  if not all  of a patient s cancer cells are wiped out in the process   While there are a number of new treatments being developed to improve chemotherapy through its actual delivery or through its ability to specifically target cancer cells  cancer immunotherapy could be an entirely different level of safety and efficacy for cancer patients   Since cancer immunotherapy is quite underdeveloped at this point  there is still some skepticism over its viability  but there is proof that it works  Take Provenge  sipuleucel t   for instance  While there is no question that Provenge was an extremely disappointing business decision for its developer Dendreon  DNDN  and the company s shareholders  everyone generally agrees that it works very well as a supplemental treatment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  MCRPC   The therapy has shown ability to extend MCRPC patient survival by a median of 4 1 months  according to its Phase III IMPACT trial   We saw another successful cancer immunotherapy drug approved for melanoma treatment in 2011 called Yervoy  ipilimumab   which is marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb  BMY   It is an inhibitor of a protein call CTLA 4 which keeps Cytotoxic T lymphocytes  in check  through one of the body s mechanisms  Through its mechanism of action  Yervoy basically frees one of the natural restrictions put on the immune system to allow for targeting of malignant melanoma cells to great success   A very similar drug known as GCS 100 targets a protein called Galectin 3  which also restricts the immune system and impairs its ability to find and destroy cancer cells  This drug is being developed by a tiny drug developer in San Diego called La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company  LJPC   GCS 100 is the company s flagship drug  and is in phase I trials for three indications  including cancer immunotherapy   It seems that the company is going to first develop the drug as a treatment for melanoma alongside Yervoy   This could be exciting for investors due to the extreme success of Yervoy in melanoma  The drug generates roughly  179 million per quarter  and takes a huge chunk of the melanoma market  which is also expected to grow rapidly in the next few years due to growth in melanoma incidence rates   While La Jolla s GCS 100 is in the very early stages of development  still phase I trials   I think that the melanoma market is a great target   especially for budding cancer immunotherapy drugs   Adding to this is a chance that there will be a partnership or acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb  The company s market capitalization of   820 000 makes it an extremely cheap but potentially lucrative acquisition for Bristol Myers that would make a lot of sense due to pairing potential with Yervoy ,2013-01-08,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-potential-in-cancer-immunotherapy-150035,150035
