200725,422241,V,Why Visa Is a Buy After Ending 2019 on a High Note,news,"As long as cash remains the majority method of payment around the globe  the digital payments industry will remain a disruptor and in growth mode  That goes for the biggest name on the block  Visa  NYSE V   which posted yet another quarter of upside after finishing the decade since the financial crisis of 2008 9  and the year Visa had its IPO  on a strong note  In spite of its massive size  the digital payments leader is still managing double digit top  and bottom line expansion  and it is forecasting the trend will continue for the foreseeable future  This stock deserves to be a core holding for investors of all types 

An eventful end to a challenging year
During its 2019 fiscal year  the 12 months ended Sept  30  2019   Visa s revenue and adjusted earnings grew 11  and 18   respectively    with a 13  and 21  rise in the two metrics during Q4  The company made five small acquisitions from December 2018 through the summer of 2019 that helped boost results  but let s not take too much away from the headline numbers  2019 was a challenge as global economic growth cooled off due to political tensions and trade disputes  which lower transaction activity  
The economic cooldown continued in the final quarter of calendar year 2019  which corresponds with Visa s fiscal 2020 Q1  and did take a small toll on the report card  but it wasn t enough to throw off the global payment network s double digit trajectory  

Data source  Visa  Pp   percentage point    
Look beyond the premium valuation
In spite of rock solid and consistent returns  some say Visa is a pass because of its valuation  After more than a decade of relentless gains  the stock trades for 37 6 times trailing 12 month earnings and 27 7 times expected one year forward earnings   
However  built into those high earnings multiples is the reason shares are a buy anyway  The forward price to earnings ratio implies a double digit advance for the bottom line in the year ahead  and management did  in fact  reiterate that expectation on its Q1 report  Full year 2020 revenue growth is expected to accelerate to a low double digit rate  as are earnings  with a 12  to 14  growth rate forecast  Both assumptions exclude any positive impact from the  5 3 billion takeover of fintech company Plaid announced in early January  and incomplete as of yet   
Which is another reason to buy Visa  Sure  the stock trades at premium pricing  but operating profit margins are over 65   Visa is able to use those profits to invest in high growth acquisitions like the Plaid deal  all the while returning massive amounts of cash to owners of the stock  During Q1 alone  the company returned  3 billion to shareholders via its dividend  currently yielding 0 6  a year  and share repurchases  A new  10 billion share repurchase program was also announced  which equates to 2 2  of Visa s current  445 billion market cap  
Put simply  Visa    as well as rival Mastercard    is one of the best mega cap stocks around  and it is well on its way to one day joining tech titans like Apple and Microsoft in the trillion dollar valuation club  With another year off to a promising start  I m picking up more shares for the long haul as the war on cash continues ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq22w,2073907

website  Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward looking statements  These statements are not guarantees of future performance  and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors  Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10 K and 10 Q  which you can find on the SEC s website and the Investor Relations section of our website  For historical non GAAP financial information disclosed in this call  the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today s earnings release And with that  let me turn the call over to Al Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMike  thank you  and good afternoon  everyone  and thank you for joining us today  2020 is off to a strong start with Visa s first quarter performance  It s reflection of our focus on clients and commitment to moving money globally seamlessly and safely  In our time today  let me first touch on our results and then discuss how we re going to grow our core C2B or consumer payments business and capturing new payment flows  which is all part of our network of network strategies  To start  our first quarter results  We had a terrific quarter  and the business is performing well  We reported net revenue growth of 10   but if you adjust for exchange rates and very low currency volatility  our net revenue growth was approximately 13   Our EPS growth was 12  or 14  on a constant dollar basis  excluding the impact of acquisitions made after Q1 last year  Key business drivers were largely consistent with the fourth quarter as we expected  For the first time in our history  total network volume this quarter was over  3 trillion Payment volume grew at 8  globally  10  excluding China and the U K  Cross border volume rose 9  on a constant dollar basis  and we processed nearly 38 billion total transactions on our network  up 11   Let me touch briefly on holiday spending  starting with the United States  where growth was similar to the 2018 and 2017 holiday season  which were both strong years  Credit growth was slightly better than last year  and debit growth slowed slightly due to lapping tax reform  which had a positive impact on U S  debit growth throughout all of last year  including the holiday season  E commerce grew three to 4x faster than non e commerce  E commerce also drove more than 1 3 of all consumer spend  up two percentage points versus last year  Retail spend growth was stronger than last year  fueled mostly by e commerce  However  it was offset by slower growth in travel and restaurant spending  To give you a brief sense of the holiday season in the other major markets  Brazil and Canada saw slightly stronger growth than last year  The U K  s growth was similar to last year s level  and growth in Australia slowed slightly Now let s look at the core business overall for the first quarter  We are growing our core payments business in three ways  through large clients and markets  number two  making progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through new partnerships  including wallets and fintech  and three  all while helping the ecosystem remove friction  We continue to have significant renewals and wins among some of our largest financial institutions  Visa renewed our issuing agreement with Capital One effective January 1 of this year  We re very pleased to continue our long standing relationship with Capital One  We recently renewed our agreement with DKB  our largest issuing bank in Germany  and we re looking forward to developing new services and products within this exclusive innovation partnership  In the Caribbean  we have renewed a multiyear contract with Royal Bank of Canada for credit and debit  This agreement also includes some new debit wins covering 17 Caribbean countries and territories  In Latin America  we re pleased to have won the credit and debit business for Santander in Brazil  Argentina and Uruguay  This leadership position with financial institutions also extends to merchants as we are the leader in co brand with 13 of the top 20 portfolios globally  This quarter  we continued to solidify our leadership position  In the United States  we were selected for the new Venmo co brand credit card  a reflection of our strong partnership with PayPal The opportunity for this product is quite significant as Venmo has over 52 million users currently  We re excited to continue growing our long standing co brand relationships with Caesars Reward and Harley Davidson  Sony has relaunched both of their co branded credit cards connected with the Sony Rewards program  Together  Sony and Visa are partnering in a number of ways to grow these programs and bring compelling offers to their cardholders  We already have a strong relationship with Costco as their co brand provider in the United States  Taiwan  South Korea and Mexico and just this quarter  secured the China co brand  In Europe  Visa extended our co brand partnerships with Norwegian Air Shuttle and S Group  respectively  In CEMEA  we renewed the Emirates NBD s credit business  and half of that portfolio is represented by the Emirates Skywards co brand program exclusively with Visa  and the rest of the portfolio is bank branded credit  Our wins are not limited to just large issuers and merchants as we continue to make progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through wallets and investments  In Africa  we have recently taken several steps to help accelerate the shift to digital payments On the credential side  mobile money wallets are already prevalent across Africa  But without a virtual or physical network credential associated with them  many international online services are unavailable to users  To help solve this problem  we announced the collaboration with MFS Africa  which is Africa s largest digital payments hub connecting through 1 API to more than 180 million mobile wallets on the continent to distribute Visa payment credentials across the continent  In an effort to build acceptance  we recently announced an investment in partnership with Flutterwave  a pan African digital payments platform that enables multi payment acceptance and processing  Together  Flutterwave will further scale its consumer payments service called Barter and its merchant acquiring service called Rave through Visa products such as Visa Direct  Visa QR and virtual cards  In addition  Visa established a strategic partnership and will acquire a minority stake    equity stake at Interswitch  a company focused on the digitization of payments that processes more than 80  of domestic transactions in Nigeria and sells payment processing across 23 other countries in Africa and operates the largest domestic debit card scheme on the continent with 23 million cardholders Our partnership will help accelerate Visa deployments of payment experiences leveraging Interswitch s processing and integration capabilities and scale their bill pay services across Africa  As we grow our business in emerging markets and with new players across the globe  we re ever focused on improving the point of sale experience and reducing friction for the entire ecosystem  In the card present environment  we continue to see meaningful momentum in tap to pay  what we consider to be the most friction free way to pay in person  We have reached a point where 1 in every three card present transactions that runs over our network is tapped versus 1 in 4 a year ago this quarter  This past year  we ve doubled the number of countries whose face to face transactions are at least 2 3 contactless  Transit continues to be a key user case and an important way to habituate tapping behavior  In New York City  on the MTA  Visa crossed two million taps in November from the beginning of the pilot and three million in January  The MTA recently announced the tap to pay expansion to their entire system by the end of 2020  and we are currently pacing a 350 000 Visa taps a week on the MTA  and nearly 1 in every 10 transactions in the New York Metro area is a tap to pay on a Visa card We also launched Africa s first contactless transit system in Johannesburg this quarter in addition to launches in Ho Chi Minh City as well as Taiwan  Sweden and Ukraine  In the e commerce environment  click to pay or what we once called Secure Remote Commerce seeks to streamline the digital payment experience across networks  offering greater security and improved sales  You may recall  we launched with a select number of merchants in October  and by the end of December  more than 40 merchants had adopted the new click to pay solution  Now that the holiday season is over  we recently completed the migration of 5 500 U S  merchants to click to pay  We expect to complete the migration of the remainder of Visa Checkout merchants in the United States over the coming months  Additionally  all 50 million consumers who are already enrolled with Visa Checkout were automatically converted to click to pay  Globally  we continue to make progress on securing the ecosystem with tokens  Introduced in 2014  tokens have expanded into 107 countries  equating to 6 billion tokenized transactions in 2019  We now have over 750 million tokens globally Over the past 18 months  Visa signed and is now live with the majority of large e commerce platform for card on file tokenizations  including Adyen  Braintree  CyberSource  PayPal  Stripe as well as some big e commerce companies  including Amazon and Netflix  amounting to hundreds of millions of new tokens  which is accelerating the pace of e commerce transactions now processed over the Visa token service  Collectively  we have secured merchant and partner commitments for tokenization in the e com space that will add up to approximately  1 trillion in Visa payment volume  Putting it together  our core business remains strong as we continue to win with traditional players  new players and seek to remove friction  Outside of our traditional C2B business  we re making progress in capturing new payment flows  In the card based B2B space  we had several wins in the first quarter  In Singapore  we won the government procurement card for Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation or OCBC  With the Singapore government mandating to digitize payments by 2023  OCBC is targeted to capture a significant public sector procurement volume  Within the CEMEA region  Visa signed a partnership with NEC payments  a digital banking and payments processing platform  to expand NEC s regional and international issuing business focused on virtual card for B2B payments such as travel and insurance In Hong Kong  we partnered with Neat  a fintech offering digital business account services  to be an exclusive partner with Visa to issue virtual commercial cards  Visa Direct served P2P  B2C and even B to small business with over 700 million transactions in the first quarter of 2020  This quarter  we wanted to highlight significant progress in the B2B cross border space  MoneyGram announced it is now live  enabling international transfers that rely on Visa Direct  The new service  which has been available within the United States in September  is starting with transfers to Spain and the Philippines  TransferWise  a global technology company for international payments  will also begin offering its customers the ability to send and receive funds in real time through Visa Direct  The integrated capability currently available in 6 countries  including Spain and Poland  will soon be available across more countries in Europe  Our continued progress with Visa Direct speaks to our network of network strategy for consumers  businesses and governments to move money to anyone anywhere  Each new network end point  be it a car  the consumer or a business account or wallet  compounds the value of the capabilities we offer to partners and improves the customer experience through a single Visa connection As we talk about network  it s hard not to mention Plaid  although I m not going to cover it in too much detail until the transaction closes  We see Plaid as having the potential to deliver real value to Visa in multiple ways  We have received a number of questions on their revenue model  so I thought I would cover it quickly  Similar to us  they have a usage based revenue model  Pricing is structured on a pay per API call basis and varies by product depending on the type of financial data consumed by the customers of the fintech  which speaks to the power of their network  We are truly excited about the acquisition  To close  we re off to a strong start in the first quarter with much to be excited about as we look forward  We are deepening partnerships with traditional players in markets and expanding assets with new players  We re removing friction in the ecosystem  and we re making significant progress to capture new flows  This is all part of our network of network strategy as we continue to focus on clients and moving money globally  seamlessly and safely  I want to take a quick moment to mention our Investor Day on February 11 here in San Francisco  which will simultaneously be webcast  You will hear from our knowledgeable and deep bench of leaders  who will discuss our view on the evolution of the ecosystem and how we intend to deliver Visa s future growth through our customer consumer payments business  new flows and value added services  The formal presentation should run from about 8 a m  to 2 30 p m  Pacific Time  and we look forward to your participation With that  let me turn it over to Vasant Vasant Prabhu    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Al  and good afternoon  everyone  We had a strong start to fiscal 2020 with results coming in consistent with our expectations  Excluding acquisitions and investment gains  constant dollar net revenue and EPS growth were 11  and 14   respectively  Exchange rates reduced revenue growth by over 1 point and EPS growth by approximately 1 5 points  The 4 acquisitions completed in the last six months increased reported revenue growth by approximately 0 5 point and expense growth by approximately three points  Starting in fiscal 2020  we are providing adjustments to our GAAP numbers each quarter to help investors better track ongoing business performance  Non GAAP results will exclude three items  one  the impact of equity investment gains and losses  two  amortization of acquired intangible assets or acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2019 and forward  and three  certain nonrecurring acquisition related costs  Prior non GAAP results were also adjusted to reflect this change  This quarter  the impact of non GAAP adjustments is de minimis  In addition  you will find a helpful schedule on the first slide of our earnings presentation In addition to GAAP and non GAAP results  we provide the growth rate impacts of exchange rates as well as the inorganic impact of acquisitions  In other words  the revenue expense and EPS impact that acquisitions had on our reported numbers this year  which were not in our reported numbers in the first quarter last year  A few highlights from the quarter  Key business driver growth rates  payments volume  process transactions and cross border volumes were stable and consistent with prior quarters  Net revenue grew 10   However  the underlying growth trend in revenues is masked by two significant drags related to currencies  First  a stronger dollar reduced nominal net revenue growth rates by over 1 point  Second  currency volatilities were at the lowest level we have seen in over five years  As may be expected  the sharp decline in currency volatility had a significant impact on international fee revenue  If you adjust for the drag from unusually low currency volatility and the drag from the strong dollar  underlying net revenue growth is robust at approximately 13   Constant dollar payments volume growth of 8  slowed by 1 point compared to last quarter  This trend    this change in trend is driven by differences in processing days when compared to the first and fourth quarters of last year  The processing day impact was over 1 point in the U S  and several points in Canada Excluding the processing day impact  Q1 payments volume growth was similar to last quarter and second quarter service revenues associated with these volumes will be in line with our expectations  Constant dollar cross border growth rates  excluding volumes within Europe  were also stable at 9   Our reported constant dollar cross border growth rate accelerated two points to 9  as we are now lapping the pan European e commerce platform  which reoriented acquiring across countries last year  converting transactions from cross border to domestic  As we have discussed in the past  this shift had minimal revenue impact to Visa as cross border transactions within Europe have revenue yields similar to domestic yields  We repurchased 13 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of  179 71 for  2 3 billion in the quarter  Our Board has authorized a new  9 5 billion share repurchase program  With this additional authorization and the  1 7 billion of remaining authorized funds as of December 31  2019  we have  11 2 billion available for share repurchases  Including our quarterly dividend of  0 30 per share  we returned approximately  3 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter  Turning now to our key business drivers and financial performance  Payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8  Credit was up 6   Debit was up 11   Growth excluding China and the U K  was 10   As a reminder  Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual branded card conversion  which have minimal revenue impact  U S  payments volume growth was up 8  with credit growing 7  and debit  9   Excluding the processing day impact I described earlier  growth accelerated almost 1 point due to a partial lapping of the Cabela s conversion and modestly higher fuel prices  Underlying consumer spending growth was largely consistent with the last quarter  International payments volume growth in constant dollars were 8  and 12   excluding China and the U K  Growth in CEMEA remained robust  22   with strong growth across Russia and the Middle East  Latin America also remains strong at 17  driven by some wins and strong performance at existing clients  Asia Pacific  excluding China  grew 8   decelerating over two points  primarily due to slower growth in Japan  Australia and Hong Kong  Europe  excluding the U K   grew 12   U K  growth remains weak and slowed 1 point after improving in each of the last two quarters  Process transactions continued to grow at 11   Constant dollar cross border growth of 9  was up two points from the last quarter but stable at 9   excluding volumes within Europe Both travel and e commerce growth were in line with the last quarter  excluding volumes within Europe  Outbound commerce accelerated from Russia  Africa and across Europe  which was offset by weaker growth out of the U S  and Asia  Inbound commerce accelerated a bit into the U S  but decelerated a little into Europe  which is consistent with the weakening dollar compared to the pound and euro  Growth into China and Hong Kong remains weak  Net revenues grew 10  or 11  in constant dollars  excluding acquisitions  The impact of our acquisitions on revenue growth was approximately 0 5 point  Service revenue growth is consistent with the last quarter at 9   Data processing revenue growth was also in line with the last quarter at 16   International transaction revenue grew 9   decreasing two points from the fourth quarter despite a smaller exchange rate drag due to the unusually low currency volatility  Other revenues grew 22   slowing 13 points from the fourth quarter as we lap ASC 606 impacts from last year  partially offset by faster growth in our value added services  Client incentives were in line with our expectations at 22 4  of gross revenue  up 80 basis points from last quarter  As we told you in October  we expected client incentives to step up from our fiscal 2019 exit percentage to the lower end of our full year outlook range in the first quarter due to the level of deal activity this quarter and last year  GAAP operating expenses were up 14  Excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and nonrecurring acquisition related costs from the 4 acquisitions that closed in the last six months  non GAAP expense growth was 13   Personnel expense growth is primarily driven by increases in staff to drive our growth initiatives  which we stepped up in the second half of last year  Acquisitions and some nonrecurring expenses also contributed to personnel expense growth  Marketing expenses decreased 1  due to the timing of some spending as well as the reporting change that shifted some expenses to the general and administrative line  The impact of acquisitions added two points to non GAAP expense growth  Exchange rates reduced reported expense growth by approximately 1 point  Nonoperating income expenses include equity investment gains of  13 million  which we are now excluding in our non GAAP results  Investment income also includes a small nonrecurring benefit  which is exactly offset in personnel expenses with no impact on earnings  Excluding these nonrecurring items  investment income is lower this year due to falling interest rates and lower cash balances  Our tax rate of 17 7  was lower due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year  This was anticipated and reflected in our outlook for tax rates this year Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year  First  let me share business driver growth for the first four weeks of the quarter  Through January 28  U S  payments volume growth was 10  with U S  credit growing 9  and debit  12   Processed transactions grew 13   Cross border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8  or 7  excluding cross border volume within Europe  Cross border volumes in the last two weeks of January are negatively impacted by the shift in the Chinese New Year with potentially some initial effects of the coronavirus outbreak  As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020  we are assuming stable growth trends on key drivers  payment volumes  processed transactions and cross border volumes  The exchange rate drag on net revenues in the second quarter could be approximately 1 point  50 basis points better than our prior outlook and consistent with the first quarter due to some weakness on the dollar since September  More than offsetting this small benefit could be the unexpected drag from currency volatility The unusually low currency volatility so far this fiscal year continues to persist into January  As may be expected    as expected  client incentives as a percent of gross revenues will climb to the upper half of our outlook range of 22 5  to 23 5   Helped by the extra day in a leap year  second quarter net revenue growth rates are expected to be in the low double digits and modestly better than the first quarter  Our second quarter revenue outlook does not reflect the potential effects of the recent coronavirus outbreak in China  It is too early to assess this impact  Second quarter expense growth is also expected to be modestly higher than the first quarter  As we had indicated in October  expenses will grow at the highest rate for the year in the second quarter as marketing expenses ramp up relative to a low level of spend last year  Also  as the dollar has weakened  the exchange rate benefit on reported expense growth will be about 1 point  50 basis points lower than we had anticipated in October Our nonoperating income expense in the first quarter had a run rate of around  65 million when you exclude the  13 million gain from equity investments and the small nonrecurring benefit I mentioned earlier  The run rate of nonoperating expenses will be somewhat higher in the second quarter due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates  Our tax rate outlook for the second quarter remains unchanged at 19  to 19 5   Overall  we are maintaining our outlook for fiscal year 2020  I will mention a few adjustments and trends that we are monitoring  On the net revenue front  we are still expecting low double digit net revenue growth in constant dollars  Based on current exchange rates and future expectations  the currency translation drag could be on the lower end of our previous 1 to 1 5 percentage point range at approximately 1 point  The 4 acquisitions we have completed in the past six months are still expected to add around 0 5 point to net revenue growth As we highlighted in October  a significant factor impacting fiscal year  20 net revenue growth is the unusually high volume of renewal activity  In fiscal year  19  we renewed 30  of our payment volume with 15  renewed in the fourth quarter alone  And we indicated fiscal year  20 renewal activity could be front loaded with another 15  to 20  of payment volume renewed in the first half  Since then  it has become apparent that renewal activity in fiscal year  20 could be even higher with three to 4 large unplanned renewals now under discussion  which would bring this year s level of renewal activity almost on par with last year  We are pleased about this since  in most of these situations  we will most likely not only renew our existing business but would also gain a larger share of these clients over the term of our new contracts  One major client renewal is already complete  and the others could get done in the next two or three months  As such  we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be at the high end of our outlook range of 22 5  to 23 5  in FY  20 Excluding acquisitions and last year s MDL related special item  our outlook assumed core expense growth in the mid  to high single digit range in constant dollars or 7  to 8   This climbs to low double digit growth when you add in the 4 acquisitions we have closed on in the past six months  which contribute three to 4 points to expense growth  Based on current exchange rates and future expectations  nominal expense growth is likely to benefit by 1 point  As such  our expense growth for the year is expected to be in the double digits with 50 basis points    which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in October  As I indicated earlier  nonoperating expense had a run rate of approximately  65 million in the first quarter  This expense will move modestly higher in each successive quarter this year due to declining interest income from lower rates  Our full year outlook for tax rates remains unchanged at 19  to 19 5  Q1 tax rates were lower than the full year outlook due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year and were largely anticipated in our full year outlook  Excluding the 4 acquisitions  our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 EPS constant dollar growth remains in the mid teens built off fiscal year  19 EPS of  5 40  Four acquisitions are expected to dilute EPS by  0 05 to  0 06  a 1 point drag on EPS growth  Based on current exchange rates and future expectations  exchange rates could reduce EPS growth by approximately 1 point  Including the acquisition and exchange rate impacts of around two points  our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 nominal EPS growth would be in the 12  to 14  range  We still expect for the fourth quarter to be the highest EPS growth quarter  Our fiscal year 2020 outlook does not include any impact from the Plaid acquisition  We will update our outlook when we have more clarity on the timing for closing on the transaction  When we announced the acquisition  we gave you some preliminary estimates of revenue and earnings implications for fiscal year  20 and  21 With that  I ll turn this back to Mike Mike Milotich    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsWe re now ready to take questions  Jordan Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America  Your line is now open Jason Kupferberg    AnalystGood afternoon guys  So just wanted to start on the incentive side  I mean the guidance change here is really only 0 5 point  I mean  if people were previously modeling the middle of the range  So I m just wondering if you expect to make up for that 0 5 point through better gross revenue  Or does it feel more like you just may land net revenues slightly lower within that overall unchanged low double digit guidance range  especially since the currency volatility has fallen off as you guys pointed out Vasant Prabhu    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYes  a couple of things  Jason  Yes  we ll see how incentives play out for the year  but the way it looks right now  the renewal activity will be higher  And so we are signaling that it could be at the upper end of the range  and as you said  if people are in the middle of the range  that s 0 5 point higher  On the other hand  we are signaling that if exchange rates stay roughly in the range they re in on where people are expecting  that is about at the lower end of the range  too So you pick up some of it there  In terms of currency volatility  we were able to absorb most of it in the first quarter and still get very close to  as you saw  what our expectations were  We re factoring that into our second quarter outlook  What is going to be for the second half  I think we ll wait and see  It s not something you can predict further out  and time will tell OperatorOur next question comes from Dan Dolev from Macquarie  Your line is now open Dan Dolev    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my question  So a quick question on cross border  It looks like a nice uptick  Can you maybe talk a little bit about that Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I guess  remember  last year  Dan  you had a number of things going on at    especially at the back end of the quarter with government shutdown  Brexit  U S  China trade talks  etc  So we were expecting some uptick off of some of those factors that had a negative impact on cross border at the time  and so we re back up in what I think we would expect to be a fairly normal range at this point OperatorOur next question comes from Tien tsin Huang from JPMorgan  Your line is now open Tien tsin Huang    AnalystThanks so much  Everything looks really consistent here  but just looking at the regional volumes  just a couple questions or clarifications  On the Asia front  it looks like it s slowed to the 4  zone  Curious what s the outlook here based on what you see in    with Europe  pretty stable  softened a touch to the low end of the 8  to 9  range  But I know you guys have made a lot of investments there  What are your expectations for Europe  Can you sort of break out of this zone based on some of the investments you ve made  What do you see there Vasant Prabhu    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYes  I might start  and Al  I m sure  will add  In Asia  we highlighted three areas  Japan was really more of a quarter over quarter comparison  There were some changes in consumption taxes in Japan that seem to push some spending into the period ahead of the tax going up  So it was pushed more into the last quarter  and so it s    we don t think that s an ongoing issue  The other one was Australia  Australia  you had some of the wildfire impact  and that seems to be one of the bigger factors there  And last was Hong Kong  and you saw    you know what some of those are We have seen impacts in Hong Kong from some of the protests going on  So that was pretty much it  Across the rest of Asia  the trends are very good  In Europe  U K  is a big chunk of our business  And the U K  has been very weak and actually slowed through the elections and had a very    relatively weak holiday season and slowed by 1 point in the quarter  If you take the U K  out  growth was a pretty healthy 12  in the rest of Europe Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe only thing    I d add two points  Tien tsin  One is the consumption tax that Vasant referred to  Now the government has decided to rebate some of that consumption tax when people do contactless transactions in Japan as part of the government s push on the cashless going into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo  So that s actually going to turn out    hopefully be a good thing not only to stimulate spending but to stimulate tap to pay spending  The other point on Europe  as Vasant rightly pointed out  the U K  has been a bit of a drag for us  but we ve been extremely focused on the continent and had some    we ve had some good wins in fintech and some good renewals  And those things are in the pipeline  and I feel pretty good about where Europe s going to head over the next couple of years in terms of growth OperatorOur next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research  Your line is now open Darrin Peller    AnalystHey  thanks  guys  Just a couple of quick ones  One is on the    look  the improvement in volume we re seeing in January seems to really underscore the comments you made around like nuances in Q    calendar Q4  like the processing day  Just if you can comment on what you re seeing in terms of the consumer  given    are these improvements into January just timing  Or do you actually see a healthier type of spending trend  And Al  just one quick follow up also was around the rebates incentives  Given so many are being done now  can you just comment on the types of returns you re expecting to see for those  Are these longer contracts than they used to be  Are they coming with more value add offerings  Something along those lines would be great Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think  Darrin  other than in the U K   the consumer has held up pretty darn well  and our volume in this last quarter  when you factor in the processing day change  which is kind of a bit of an anomaly  but if you look in September  the last day of September in 2018 was a Sunday  and a lot of merchants have acquired whole volume on a Sunday  So what ended up happening  a bunch of 1 day s worth    a lot of volume in    for 1 day got pushed into the first quarter of  19  We did not have that same phenomena this past quarter because the last day of September this year was a Monday  So we just simply had a dynamic that it was a    we had a harder grow over  And so when you actually adjust for that  our growth quarter over quarter was pretty similar  So in general  I think the consumer has held up quite well  and there s no reason to see it go down other than  again  depending upon where this coronavirus ends up going and who knows at this point  Just to be clear  when you have to have rebates and incentives  the    when I was referring to the rebate  that was a rebate being given by the government in Japan I don t know whether that s what you were referring to  But in general  we are trying to obviously strike the right balance in terms of incentives that we do in deals  try to make many of them  as many of those incentive dollars growth oriented as possible so that as a partner s volume picks up  their incentives pick up  but we re also getting the associated volume with them  And as I think    I probably know  Darrin  we obviously pushed for contracts that are as long as possible  There s    to some degree  most of them kind of fall in a 5  to 7 year cycle  Every once in a while  there s some 10 year deals  And then there s issuers that like to do deals every couple of years  and those would tend to be more of the issuers that are dual issuers So it s always a bit of a balancing act to try to get to the right level  But I think we try to structure these incentives in smart ways where they re growth oriented  they re focused on consumption of different numbers of Visa products and try to build relationships with issuers that go well beyond just an issuing relationship to encompass Visa Direct  to encompass tokenization  etc OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank  Your line is now open Bryan Keane    AnalystHi guys Wanted to ask about Capital One  I know Mastercard also announced the renewal with Capital One  So maybe you could help us sort out how that contract breaks and if this is a net positive for both networks  And then just secondly  Vasant  on expense growth  I think your comments last quarter was it was expected to be similar to the fourth quarter  which I think was around 11 4   and it came in a little bit higher  Was there any pull forward in expenses because I think operating margins at The Street we re expecting were a little higher than they came in Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBryan  let me just    quick point on Cap One  and then I ll let Vasant comment on acquisitions  Look  Cap One has been a classic dual issuer  and it always depends on what portfolios each network happens to have and how they perform at any given point in time  But they re a big terrific bank with a lot of innovative people on their team  We love working with them  And so it s a good thing for us  and I m sure that  that s how I would say it s a good thing for them as well Vasant Prabhu    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYes  expense growth was a couple of points higher than we might have expected  Some of it is exchange rate  So as you saw  the exchange rates were somewhat better than we    the exchange rate impact was somewhat better than we expected on revenues  which means  on the expense side  was somewhat worse  I think that was about 1 point  And as we    and as I indicated in my comments  there were a few other nonrecurring types of things that added another point  So in general  there weren t any real surprises  They re pull forward of investments  There was just a couple of these kinds of items OperatorOur next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies  Your line is now open Trevor Williams    AnalystHi  good afternoon and appreciate you taking the question  This is a little bit higher level  but I m curious internationally with a couple of government backed systems like Mir in Russia and TROY in Turkey that mandate domestic processing  I guess  first  just how you see your role in the economics you can earn in both of those markets over the longer term  And then second  more broadly  if you re comparing today s backdrop to  I don t know  five or 10 years ago  just what kind of threat you guys think nationalist payments agendas could pose to the international business going forward Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook  Trevor  I    we    some of these domestic processing platforms and domestic schemes are not terribly new  Our objective is to work closely with both regulators to make sure it s an even playing field and then work closely with our clients to make sure that we get a fair share of business  Many times  our processing network of VisaNet actually just plain and simple has a lot more richness to its various offerings  And people    we ve had cases where banks see that and prefer to process with us because of the investment  the level of security  the level of innovation  So we ll continue to be up against this kind of    this backdrop But I think it s still allowing us to grow at healthy levels  and we re trying to partner in a thoughtful way as much as we can  To your question about the backdrop on nationalism today versus 10 years ago  I think you d have to say it has become a little bit more pronounced simply because it wasn t that nearly as prominent a decade or so ago  But again  I think our job is to continue to innovate  work closely with regulators and with our clients to have as much of an even playing field as possible and continue to show that processing on Visa or minimally partnering with Visa as your scheme has good advantages to it that people want to work with us OperatorOur next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein  Your line is now open Harshita Rawat    AnalystHi  good afternoon  Thanks for taking my question  Al  if I look at the long term history of your growth versus your largest competitor  it s been quite stable  More recently  though  over the last one or two years  you ve seen some delta open up between your volume metrics and your peers  So can you talk about some of the drivers of this  And more importantly  if you look out next few years  can we expect the gap to narrow because of what you re doing with fintechs internationally and also the strength in Visa Direct Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Harshita  Look  both companies have performed extremely well on a number of dimensions  Look at this most recent quarter  We re very pleased with our results  And look  Mastercard had a great quarter  and they ve had some good quarters the last couple of years as have we  That said  a few points  First of all  volume metrics are    don t have any standards attached to them  And it s always difficult to do an apples to apples comparison between the two companies and really understand what s going on fully in terms of the volume  On the revenue side  the revenue deltas have been a bit smaller in a number of the recent quarters There s huge mix differences in our business  We ve got a very big position in the United States  and we wouldn t trade that for the world  It s just  plain and simple  a much more mature market that doesn t have the same high double digit  mid double digit  even over 20  kind of growth prospects to it  but we re certainly pleased to have the partnerships with the banks that we have and the position that we have in the United States  The last point I d make is that my expectation is based on the investments that we re making in value added services  in new payment flows  in working with fintechs  working with neobanks  working on engagement with our existing customers  building out our acceptance footprint that I m quite confident that  over time  we will close that gap and continue to perform very well for our investors OperatorOur next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson  Your line is now open Lisa Ellis    AnalystHi  good afternoon  guys  A question on Visa Direct  You mentioned the greater than 700 million transactions in 1Q  You ve highlighted previously that Visa Direct was growing in the triple digits  So I guess question one  is it still growing that rate  And then also  how are the yields tracking in Visa Direct  I mean is it sort of comparable to debit  I know there s a lot of cross border in there  too  And last one    all related to Visa Direct  I promise  But you mentioned a few new partnerships  As you complete the Earthport integration  what are some of the major use cases for Visa Direct you re seeing rolling in as we move through 2020 Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo first of all  Lisa  our growth in Visa Direct remains incredible  It didn t quite get to triple digit growth this quarter  but it was very  very high single digit    double digits and close to that level  In terms of yields  we really haven t talked much about it  but to your point  Visa Direct is going to increasingly have some more cross border transactions that will run over that platform and that    our push platform  And that is obviously a very good thing for us  I think when we talk about use cases  I think they re going to fall into some of the same buckets they fall into today  P2P  disbursements  remittances  and I think that those businesses will continue to grow  And you ll see on Investor Day that we ll highlight a good number of Visa Direct use cases with quite a few specific examples  So we look forward to what    taking you through it on the 11th OperatorOur next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI  Your line is now open David Togut    AnalystThank you  Good afternoon  Given the ongoing weakness you re seeing in U K  volumes and the incremental 1 point deceleration you called out  could you update us out on your growth pivot moving employees out of London and into some of the higher growth markets of Italy  Poland and Germany  And when might this growth pivot accelerate your volume growth in Europe Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo David  we don t have any active plans to kind of move people out of the U K  We re just  plain and simple  as we grow the business  adding employees on the continent and certainly adding    the vast majority of employees we would add in that region are in market offices on the continent  First  I d also comment that I m certainly hopeful now that at least there is some clarity around the Brexit outcome that we might find a new normal in the U K  that would allow their economy to pick up  Certainly  I was in Davos last week  and certainly the officials in the U K  that I talked to feel as if that it s on the verge of starting to come back We ll see what happens  In terms of the continent  in many of these markets  we ve been behind  plain and simple  And over the last 4 or 5 quarters  we ve been    after we got the integration behind us  we started investing in fairly significant ways  and we re winning deals and trying to build our credit business  build our acceptance footprint  And so it takes a little bit of time for the pipeline to work its way into the numbers  But I think over the next couple of years  we ll start to see some real payback for the progress that we re making now in    on the continent in Europe OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW  Your line is now open Sanjay Sakhrani    AnalystThanks  I appreciate your commentary on the coronavirus  but I was wondering if you could dimensionalize the cross border China business and maybe any impact it may have and sort of how you could address it  And then secondly  on the three to 4 unplanned renewals  is there any context as to why it s happening that banks are choosing to renew early Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo on coronavirus  let me start with it s certainly just too early to know  When we look at our numbers  we see some declines  but Chinese New Year this year was earlier this week  January 25  And last year  in 2019  it was February 5  and spending slows around the holiday  So we re    given that we re about 12 days earlier this year  it s hard to know what s really impacting the volumes at this stage  There s    that said  there s definitely going to be impact  I mean when planes are being halted both in and out of China  and you re probably reading as we are that companies are telling their employees to stay home  so even for the e commerce world  employees are staying home  who s picking    and who s picking goods and shipping them  So I think  for sure  there ll be some impacts  and    but we ll have to see how pronounced it gets and how long it goes  I m not in the predicting game for it at the moment In terms of the early renewals  what tends to happen is probably about half the time it s us and half the time  it s the client who says    as we re talking to them about deepening our relationship and we re talking about them    to them about all the dynamics that are going on in payments and or we re talking to them about building a deeper relationship by them consuming more and more of Visa s capabilities and solutions  if a deal is going to be up in a year or one and half years or two years  usually that s no longer than that  but as the deal s going to come up in  say  one and half years to two years or less  one of the two of us  us or the client  will say why don t we just get our deal done and extend it out a number of years so that we can focus on all of these capabilities  and we can work together on trying to grow the business versus starting down a path where the client is going to consume more Visa product And then we have to halt everything while our teams on both sides go into negotiation mode  and it just slows down the wheels of the progress  But I think what s happening  because payments is just more complex than it was four or five years ago and the number of offerings is greater than it was even two or three years ago  I think that this is what s kind of driving this    I don t want to call it a phenomena but driving this occurrence  And this year  as Vasant said in his remarks  there are four decent sized financial institutions that were not scheduled to be up this year  They were not built into our numbers or incentive  One of them is already done  I referred to it in my remarks  which was Santander and the deal that we did with them in South America  So there s three others where there s live discussion going on right now  and it s too early to tell whether a deal definitely gets done or not  but my expectation is that  more likely than not  at least a couple of them that were not planned will get done OperatorOur next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open James Faucette    AnalystThank you very much  I wanted to ask about the acquisitions that you ve been doing and perhaps the change in reporting  what that may indicate  And in the past  Visa has done a lot of investments in companies and fintechs  etc  even before fintech was coined as a term  But seems like you ve picked up  at least in the last year  the pace of acquisition  Is this part of a    should we expect more acquisitions and you to be more active in actually acquiring companies than you have been in the past  Or is this maybe a little bit anomalous  Just wondering how you re thinking about incorporating some of the development that s happening outside Visa into Visa proper Vasant Prabhu    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I think Al may add some more things  We ll talk more about this at Investor Day but just a quick response to that question  I don t think we re deliberately stepping up the level of acquisition activity or investment activity and some kind of change of direction  Our approach has always been we build any core capability  and if it is faster or cheaper or there s talent that we can get from the outside that will be valuable  then we would consider acquisitions  and there s a logic to every one of those we did  On the investment side  typically  when it s complementary capabilities  we prefer to partner  and we do lots and lots of partnerships as you know Business is built on partnerships  Occasionally  we get into a situation where a company may like us to invest or we want to invest because we do want to enhance our relationship  get closer  have a better commercial agreement  get some exclusivity and so on  The reason the volume has gone up  to some degree  is because  as you know  there s a lot of activity nowadays in terms of companies with business models and capabilities that are very valuable to us  either as capabilities for us to own or capabilities to partner with  So it reflects what s going on in the marketplace  too  And it ll    the pace of activity will depend on exactly applying the criteria I just mentioned  It could go up if we find more than meet our criteria or it could go down OperatorOur next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Dan Perlin    AnalystThanks  Al  you went through a pretty exhaustive list of breaking down core versus new flows and then reduced friction as kind of three big tenets of growth  I m trying to  I guess  parse out  how do you break those down  I mean is core like 80  of the growth as we think about the next couple of years then layering in these other two to three assets  Or how should we kind of parse out that as we kind of think through all of these opportunities for you Alfred F  Kelly Jr    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  again  Dan  Investor Day  we ll talk a lot about all three of these items  To be very honest  we don t have a debt mix that we re trying to get to across the three items that you cited  We re trying to make sure that we do as well as we possibly can against all three to try to make sure that we re delivering sustained good levels of revenue growth  And some of it will depend on what s happening at a particular point in time in economies and where we end up choosing to put investment dollars  So there s a lot of factors that go into it  But we re not setting out to hit some certain mix  We re setting out to do a really good job in our core business  We re doing it to try to extend the business through new payment flows and value added services and with the addition of Plaid  extend the business in our network of network business even further  So that s really what our objective is  Dan OperatorOur last question comes from Dave Koning from Baird  Your line is now open Dave Koning    AnalystHey  guys  Thank you  When we look at cross border  the reported volume growth all through last year was pretty slow  And I know that has to do with just currency  right  But the revenue growth was way  way above volume growth  This quarter  volume growth has gotten better  but the disconnect  I guess  between volume and revenue has gotten smaller  Like that gap between volume and reported revenue growth has gotten smaller  Why is that  And should it be closer  Should it stay closer like that throughout this year Vasant Prabhu    Vice Chairman and Chief Financial OfficerYes  the delta between volume growth and revenue growth are driven by a variety of factors  The most important are currency related  right  Most of the time  the delta is driven by currency impacts  Clearly  pricing plays a role  So there was some pricing in there that was causing the revenue growth to be faster than volume growth  Currency effects can then move it one direction or the other And then when volatilities move in a big way  and this quarter we had a very big move  if you look at volatilities  we are at five year lows now  not seen since 2014  Historically  those have corrected over time  so that  we think  is a transient thing  But when volatilities decline  the revenues related to those volatilities are also in that line  And this quarter  those had a big impact  If volatilities were the same year over year  our revenue growth would have been fairly comparable to last quarter on the international fee line Mike Milotich    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  Jordan  And thank you all for joining us today  If you have any additional questions

200821,422337,V,3 Reasons Visa s  5 3 Billion Deal for Plaid Is a No Brainer,news,"Fintech is all set to be a hot growth industry  Bank stocks were a massive hit in the decade since the Great Recession  but now the industry is primed for disruption through things like digital payments processing  blockchain  and banking services combined with e commerce 
One of the biggest areas of growth in fintech has been financial aggregators and interaccount connectivity  and now Visa  NYSE V  is betting on the movement with its  5 3 billion deal for Plaid  Plaid is the tech that enables apps like PayPal s Venmo  automated investing firm Betterment  zero commission trading firm Robinhood  and thousands of other apps to connect with banking infrastructure and facilitate the transfer of funds  It may sound like a large sum of money  but this deal is a no brainer for Visa 
Plaid is undoubtedly growing very quickly
Visa disclosed that it is paying  5 3 billion in cash and will eventually sell some new debt to replenish its reserves  Based on Plaid s last funding round in December 2018    in which it raised  250 million in cash    the fintech outfit was valued at half the amount Visa will now pony up for it 
That implies Plaid is a fast growing fintech start up  Visa didn t provide any specifics on the small company s financials  but it did provide a little context  According to a report from EY com cited by Visa  75  of the consumers connected to the internet used a fintech application to move money between accounts in 2019  versus just 18  in 2015  Plaid is helping lead the way in that department  with Visa saying that one in four people with a U S  bank account have used Plaid    most of them unknowingly  as Plaid operates in the background to connect more than 11 000 financial institutions  Plaid connected 10 million accounts in 2015  but that number surged an average of 115  a year to reach over 200 million accounts in 2019 
Though the start up won t be a core part of Visa s digital payments processing business  the fact that so many people are now using apps to move money around will help Visa stave off disruption from changes in consumer behavior in the years ahead 

Visa already had a vested interest in the company
Visa was among the businesses that participated in the last investment round in 2018  along with global rivals Mastercard and American Express  Acquisition activity has been heating up the last few years  and Plaid s huge growth has been on the radar of many digital finance firms  Perhaps keeping Plaid away from key competitors factored into the decision to make the purchase  
Buying out the rest of the equity in Plaid will also help Visa indirectly participate in the growth of other fintech companies  Plaid has penetrated key segments of the industry with its account linking software  including banking and investing  5  penetration of a  650 million addressable market   consumer payments  3  of a  950 million addressable market   and lending  2  of a  1 billion addressable market   Thus  there s plenty of room to keep expanding the multi account connectivity software platform  Buying out the rest of Plaid also means Visa could plug the fintech firm into its global ecosystem  Plaid is well established here in the United States but it has only just begun to expand internationally    where Visa says there are 15 times more fintech users 
 5 3 billion is pocket change
All of the reasons for the purchase sound great  but was  5 3 billion worth it  Without knowing how big Plaid actually is  it s hard to say  However  Visa has time to let the small company develop  and the capital needed to support it  
During its recently completed 2019 fiscal year  the global digital payments leader generated  23 0 billion in revenue and  12 1 billion in net income  yup  you read that right  Visa operates at a 52 6  net margin   The company also had  7 8 billion in unrestricted cash on the books at the end of the year  Plaid and its massive potential in the years ahead thus cost Visa a quarter s worth of revenue and half a year s worth of net profit  not to mention liquid balances in reserve  Plaid may have doubled in value in just over a year  but my bet is it will go down as a pretty smart move on Visa s part down the road ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pix1t,2061224

200843,422359,V,Visa Makes a Big Bet on Fintech With  5 3 Billion Plaid Acquisition,news,"Visa  NYSE V  said on Monday that it would acquire privately held Plaid  a leading financial technology provider  in a deal valued at  5 3 billion  Plaid s platform helps consumers securely connect their financial accounts to the apps they use  while  helping them manage their financial lives   Visa said in a press release 
The company said that the acquisition of Plaid represents both an entry into new businesses and complementary enhancements to Visa s existing business  providing new market opportunities both in the U S  and abroad while delivering advanced payment capabilities to app developers 

What is Plaid 
Plaid is a frequently used payments technology platform that many consumers have never heard of  It works behind the scenes to secure users  financial information while connecting to the apps they want and need  Its platform provides end to end encryption  strong multifactor authentication  and robust monitoring to ensure that customers  data is secure  
For example  when users set up a PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  Venmo account    which allows them to transfer money to friends    it s Plaid s technology working behind the scenes that enables the users to link their bank accounts to Venmo  PayPal is one of Plaid s biggest customers  and PayPal s CEO Dan Schulman chimed in  saying   We have strong relationships with both Visa and Plaid  The combination of Plaid s capabilities with the security and scale of Visa s global network will provide us with exciting opportunities to enhance our products  
Visa CEO Al Kelly said   We are extremely excited about our acquisition of Plaid and how it enhances the growth trajectory of our business  Plaid is a leader in the fast growing fintech world with best in class capabilities and talent  The acquisition  combined with our many fintech efforts already underway  will position Visa to deliver even more value for developers  financial institutions  and consumers   
Massive reach and scale
On a conference call to discuss the acquisition  Visa provided a number of compelling statistics that show why the company is furthering its move into fintech with the acquisition of Plaid  In 2019  75  of the world s internet users made use of a fintech app  up from just 18  in 2015  Plaid is the leading financial data network in the U S  and has recently expanded to both Canada and Europe  In fact  one in four people with a U S  bank account have interacted with Plaid s technology  
The company boasts over 200 million user accounts  an amount that has increased at a compound annual growth rate of more than 100  since 2015  Plaid is also well accepted within the financial community  connected with more than 11 000 financial institutions 
It should be noted that Visa is paying a hefty premium for Plaid  In 2018  during the company s most recent funding round  Plaid was valued at roughly  2 65 billion  though this investment is nothing more than pocket change to Visa  with its market cap of more than  435 billion  
A further push into fintech
The acquisition of Plaid is just the latest move by Visa to go beyond its credit card roots and establish a strong foothold in the rapidly evolving world of fintech  Over the past year  Visa acquired cross border payments specialist Earthport  financial token provider Rambus  and merchant data company Verifi  among others  
Visa is continuing its push to stake a claim in the lucrative fintech market  which is expected to grow to more than  124 billion by 2025  achieving a compound annual growth rate of nearly 24  ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph-k5,2059345

200909,422425,V,Better Buy  Square vs  Visa,news,"Visa  NYSE V  and Square  NYSE SQ  are two of the best known financial services companies in the world right now  but they re very different from an investment perspective 
Visa is the financial giant that s at the center of trillions of dollars in credit card transactions and Square is the nimble upstart trying to disrupt the established financial system  starting with mobile payments  Another way to differentiate the two companies would be to say that Visa is a stock for value investors and Square is better for growth investors 
But there s a lot more to these financial services companies than that  

The core businesses of Visa and Square
Both Visa and Square take a skim off every transaction that happens on their platforms  but Visa s is much larger and more profitable than Square s  As the charts below illustrate  Visa is more than five times larger from a revenue standpoint and is highly profitable while Square is yet to post a profit  

SQ Revenue  TTM  data by YCharts
Much of the difference comes from the scale at which they operate  but part of it also derives from each company s place in the value chain  Visa is a worldwide payment company with only a few genuine competitors to think about  It has pricing power as a result 
Square is in a highly competitive market niche  with dozens of specialized rivals offering similar suites of services beyond transactions  like scheduling  payroll  and even capital  As a result  it generates fairly low margins  and will even offer discounts to high volume customers to win their business  Visa  by contrast  gets customers because businesses have to use its service almost by default  
Growth is Square s specialty
When it comes to making money  Visa is clearly the winner  But Square s revenue growth on a percentage basis is far more rapid  albeit from a much smaller base  

SQ Revenue  TTM  data by YCharts
Square has been able to grow in a couple of ways  First  it s adding customers to the platform rapidly  both by reaching new clients and expanding the capabilities that make it attractive to businesses like restaurants and retailers  It has also expanded the number of services it can offer  and charge  existing customers  including payroll  scheduling  capital  and much more  
Where Square has a lot of room for growth is in niches outside of business transactions  It has tried to do that with Square Cash  which essentially cuts out the fees that Visa and other legacy financial institutions charge for fund transfers  If it can create a new ecosystem that sidesteps the traditional intermediaries  it could lower its costs and increase margins  It s a long shot  but that s the best case scenario for Square long term  
The best stock today
The battle between these two companies comes down to a choice between a growth stock and a stock that has a highly profitable business and a wide competitive moat  I prefer the stability of the moat that Visa has built  and don t see any reason to think it will be disrupted in the near future  
Better yet  as Square grows  it actually helps grow Visa s network and revenue as well  That s another reason Visa is the better of these two stocks  even if it can t match Square s growth rate ",2020-01-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pcdoo,2051224
200910,422426,V,Does Visa Deserve Its Bullish Valuation ,news,"Visa  NYSE V  leads the global digital payment market with a secure payment network that is capable of processing over 65 000 payments per second  The company does not extend loans or credit but offers a technology platform that allows financial institutions and vendors to transact with credit  debit  and gift cards  The company has issued bullish guidance for next year  indicating internal optimism about the growth prospects in the near term  Is this war on cash stock worth buying at today s price 
Visa s valuation is bullish but in line with peers
Visa stock currently trades at 30 3 times forward earnings and 35 5 times free cash flow  which are slightly lower than peers such as Paypal and Mastercard  but much higher than American Express  Visa s EV EBITDA ratio of 26 9 follows a very similar pattern  Analysts are forecasting 15  annual earnings growth over the medium term  resulting in a PEG ratio of approximately two  This battery of valuation metrics suggests that Visa is priced in line with peers based on multiple profitability measurements  even when adjusting for variations in growth outlook and capital structure 

As a further kicker for investors  Visa pays a 0 55  cash dividend yield  which helps to deliver some income returns independent of market price performance  The company also has consistently returned value to shareholders with a stock repurchase program that has a buyback yield above 2   which helps to augment market returns through anti dilution  The overall dividend and repurchase activity is rather modest compared to companies in other sectors  but it is nonetheless a nice bonus to have some reliable upside along with the growth potential  
Visa has some very pleasing operational metrics
Visa leads its peer group with a stellar 67  operating margin and a 52 6  net profit margin  Only Mastercard approaches these figures but is still roughly ten percentage points lower  This is not an aberration  because the company s margins have been stable for the past five years  and its operating margin was still over 56  for each year of the past decade  This spread has allowed the company to deliver an excellent return on invested capital  ROIC  of 26 5   which is double the industry average and far in excess of the company s 6 8  weighted average cost of capital  Visa s operating metrics indicate an efficiently run organization  with high quality earnings that translate to cash flows 
Visa is a great position to capitalize on global trends
Financial technology is rapidly changing the ways that people transfer money and pay for goods and services  Digital transfers  blockchain  and other new solutions are quickly disrupting the market  creating new players and forcing incumbents to adapt through acquisition  The result is a fairly fragmented industry 
It is difficult to make long term forecasts at a time with so much innovation and change on a global scale  but Visa is in a great position to benefit from market trends  The company has shown a willingness to participate in innovation through acquisitions  having purchased Verifi  Payworks  Earthport in 2019  These will provide solutions for issues related to disputed charges  cross border transfers  and payment efficiency  Visa is participating in the benefits of blockchain  having announced its use of the technology to facilitate B2B payments with B2B Connect 
Visa has a massive market share  and there are switching costs associated with moving away from Visa s services  This is especially true for the largest providers of goods and services  which would require a substantial overhaul to completely revamp payment systems to a different competitor  The fact that it s hard for businesses to leave creates a moat that protects the company s fundamentals from rapid deterioration  Even in situations of rapid market shifts  such as the wide spread adoption of Square s mobile payments platform  new solutions can actually function hand in hand with Visa  so some competitive innovations might even benefit the company s legacy business 
Overall  consumers are showing a declining preference for cash payments  and Visa is in an excellent position to capitalize on this evolving trend  Fintech and payment solutions will be buoyed fundamentally by strong tailwinds for the foreseeable future  and investors would be wise to gain some exposure to these trends  The nature of innovation makes it impossible to identify one clear winner in the group  especially if changes in blockchain and digital currency have even greater impacts than anticipated  However  Visa makes a clear case to be among the shares best suited to provide exposure to the boom ",2020-01-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pcg1m,2051301

200933,422449,V,UK regulators call time on lengthy glitches in banking services,news,"By Huw Jones
LONDON  Reuters    Regulators made proposals on Thursday to strengthen the ability of banks and payment firms in Britain to recover from disruptions to services within set timeframes 
A parliamentary committee called for changes in October following a string of IT failures at banks  most recently one at TSB that left thousands of customers unable to make payments from their accounts 
The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have proposed that banks and financial market infrastructure  FMIs  firms like Visa  NYSE V  that make payments possible set  impact tolerances  for important services 
This would quantify the maximum level of disruption they would tolerate in terms of time  volume of business or number of customers affected 
A metric based on time alone may be insufficient  the regulators said  taking a more nuanced approach from an earlier discussion paper 
Firms will have to spell out what back up plans they have to stay within these tolerances 
Firms will set their own tolerances but should expect  close supervisory scrutiny and engagement   the regulators said 
 It is in the public interest that a resilient financial system is able to supply the most important services with minimal interruption even during severe operational events   FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a statement 
The regulators also issued papers on how operational resilience relates to services outsourced by financial firms  such as cloud computing  that can leave them vulnerable to disruptions 
Firms must be certain that important services can recover from a disruption within a set period even when they rely on outsourcing or third party providers for those services  the BoE said 
 Firms and FMIs should use impact tolerances as a planning tool and should assure themselves they are able to remain within them in severe but plausible scenarios   the BoE said ",2019-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uk-regulators-call-time-on-lengthy-glitches-in-banking-services-2034407,2034407
200934,422450,V,Fed voters a less hawkish bunch in 2020  lowering bar for U S  rate cut,news,"By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The bar for cutting U S  interest rates may get a little lower next year when a new crop of central bankers rotate into voting spots on the Federal Reserve s policy setting panel as part of its annual membership reshuffle 
The four regional Fed bank presidents gaining a vote on interest rates starting in January are slightly less hawkish overall than the four they replace  a review of public comments and voting records shows 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that after three rate cuts this year  only a  material  change to the economic outlook could trigger a further reduction  When they meet next week for the last time this year  policymakers are expected to leave rates in the current range of 1 5  to 1 75  
Next year will be a different story  says Oxford Economics  Gregory Daco  who expects a cooling economy  sub 2  inflation and persistent trade tensions to force a reassessment of the Fed s outlook in the early part of the year  Also making a rate cut more likely  he said  is that starting in January  rate setters will be a  slightly more dovish group that is likely to favor more easing in the event of a deteriorating outlook  
To be sure  Daco and others said  the voting lineup is far from determinative 
All 17 Fed policymakers participate in two days of discussions that precede each final rate setting vote by 10 of them  and non voters can exert considerable influence during that time  Partly because voters do rotate every January  policymakers tend to favor compromise and consensus 
 For a graphic on Fed policymakers  voting records  views and take on the economy  please see  
HAWKS AND DOVES
Even among voters  the differences are subtle 
Both hawkish dissenters against this year s three interest rate cuts   Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George   rotate out of the voting lineup after next week s meeting 
Chicago Fed President Evans  who supported the rate cuts  also drops off the voting roll  as does St  Louis Fed President James Bullard  who used his vote in 2019 to signal support for even steeper rate cuts than the Fed delivered 
Rotating in are Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester  who opposed all three rate cuts  and Philadelphia Fed President Harker  who went along with the first rate cut but opposed the other two  Joining them will be Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan  who backed the 2019 rate cuts  though in October it was on condition the Fed made it clear no more were likely unless conditions worsen 
The fourth new 2020 voter  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  is arguably the most dovish among all Fed policymakers  Like Bullard  he wanted a bigger rate cut than his colleagues in 2019  but he also proposed the Fed promise not to raise rates until inflation reaches 2  on a sustained basis 
 On net  the committee will be slightly less hawkish   said Michael Brown  principal U S  economist for Visa  NYSE V   meaning voters could be more open to rate cuts than otherwise 
But  he added   I am not sure it matters much   because Fed policymakers will  in the end  react to economic data 
Consumer spending bolstered by strong jobs growth has propelled the U S  economy despite a decline in business spending and a drop in manufacturing output as the U S  China trade war continues 
Should that pillar of growth show signs of weakening  Brown said  Fed voters won t be the only ones on board with easing 






 I think you would get a broad consensus to cut rates as needed   he said ",2019-12-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-voters-a-lesshawkish-bunch-in-2020-lowering-bar-for-us-rate-cut-2035521,2035521

200956,422472,V,Off the radar  U S  CEOs  jet perks add millions to corporate tax bills,news,"By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON  Reuters    As U S  corporate jet use approaches pre financial crisis levels and chief executives take an increasing number of personal trips on the company tab  many investors are being kept in the dark about the true cost of the perk  For the S P 500 companies that pay for their CEOs to use corporate jets for private trips  the estimated median value of that flying climbed 11 percent last year to  107 286 from  96 532 in 2017  according to the latest available figures from compensation research firm Equilar Inc  That is up 27 percent from  84 636 in 2007  the year before the financial crisis  This is taxable income for executives  The estimates are often based on what a first class seat would have cost on a commercial flight rather than on the true  much higher cost of using a corporate jet   But not only are companies left to pay the full cost of those flights  which can be for anything from family vacations to trips to major sports events or a commute from a distant family home  but they can also find that their tax bills can be significantly higher because of lost deductions  That is because the U S  Internal Revenue Service has limited a company s deductions on personal aircraft use to the estimated valuation of the executives  flights   As a result  companies forfeit a long list of tax deductions for the time the jets are used for personal trips  including pilots  salaries  maintenance costs  insurance  aircraft depreciation and finance charges  Companies usually can deduct the full cost of these expenses when planes are used for business flights  Exacerbating the issue  U S  President Donald Trump s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated deductions on two kinds of flights  said Ruth Wimer  a tax expert and partner at law firm Winston   Strawn LLP in Washington  They are for trips taken purely for business entertainment   such as a CEO taking clients to a golf tournament   and an executive s use of a corporate jet to commute to work from his home  she said  However  given that the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission does not require disclosure of such lost deductions  investors are none the wiser  U S  business jet operations are on track to top 4 5 million arrivals and departures in 2019  the highest since 2007  according to U S  Federal Aviation Administration data  though only a small percentage are by major company executives  Popular perceptions of U S  corporate jet use hit a nadir in 2008 as the financial crisis was worsening  That was when members of Congress blasted the CEOs of the three big U S  automakers for flying to Washington on corporate jets to ask for financial help   The fallout was so bad that in the terms of its bailout General Motors Co  N GM  was initially barred from corporate jet use    But since then  the whole economy has turned around  The stock market is setting records and jet use has rebounded along with it   said Nick Copley  president of SherpaReport com  which analyzes private aviation trends  GM is back to operating its own corporate aircraft  according to its disclosures   HIDDEN ELEMENT OF EXECUTIVE PAY  The true cost of corporate jets are a mystery for investors in many companies  though  A Reuters analysis of proxy filings by companies in the S P 500 found that only a handful detailed the value of lost deductions in their public filings   Among the few to disclose was payments system and credit card company  Visa Inc   NYSE V    Its lost deductions from the personal use of company jets by executives and their guests have more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2018  and totaled  4 8 million in its fiscal year to September 2018  according to the company s last proxy statement  Visa did not reply to messages seeking comment  Another exception is cable and broadcast TV group Comcast Corp  O CMCSA   which reported  8 8 million in disallowed deductions in 2018 on flights taken by its executives and guests   Comcast declined to comment  This is a hidden element of executive pay  said Dieter Waizenegger  executive director of CtW Investment Group  which represents union sponsored pension funds with nearly 5 million members   Having a better sense of how expensive the C suite is for the company is a very relevant number   Waizenegger said   If they aren t disclosed  investors won t know about these lost deductions   While the costs for Visa and Comcast  both with annual net earnings of more than  10 billion  may be a drop in the bucket  lost deductions for smaller companies can have a much bigger impact  Earlier this year  San Francisco based hedge fund Voce Capital Management LLC targeted disallowed tax deductions in its campaign to gain board seats at insurer Argo Group International Holdings Ltd  N ARGO    The hedge fund argued the Bermuda based insurance company  which had net income of  63 6 million in 2018  was hurting investors by racking up disallowed tax deductions from corporate jets  crisscrossing the globe at a dizzying pace    Argo declined to comment for this story  It has said previously that when its executives use corporate aircraft for personal trips they do so at their own expense  However  it does not disclose how that is calculated or detail any lost tax deductions as a result of personal travel   Voce has not provided any estimates for lost tax deductions  It did not reply to messages seeking comment   However  it did outline in a statement earlier this year what it said  most ordinary people would consider the trip of a lifetime   by then Argo CEO Mark Watson and his family on an Argo Gulfstream jet during the 2017 Christmas holidays  The trip began in San Antonio  Texas  with stops in Bermuda  New York  Copenhagen and the Malabar Coast of India  Jaipur in northern India  Amsterdam  and then back to Texas over a three week period  
The company said in October the SEC was investigating Argo s disclosures about executive compensation  Within a few weeks  the company announced Watson s departure ",2019-12-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/off-the-radar-us-ceos-jet-perks-add-millions-to-corporate-tax-bills-2031378,2031378
200984,422500,V,New Wells Fargo CEO says he wants to fix problems  isn t a  wallflower ,news,"By Imani Moise
 Reuters     Wells Fargo    Co s  N WFC  new chief executive  Charlie Scharf  told employees this week he is more hands on in his early days than at his previous CEO roles in order to tackle the bank s regulatory and operational problems as staff grilled him about everything from growth targets to his family dog 
When he started as CEO jobs in that past  Scharf focused on learning about the companies but at Wells Fargo  the need to develop controls has brought a sense of urgency  he told employees on Tuesday at Wells Fargo s campus in Charlotte  North Carolina  A source provided Reuters a recording of the event 
 If I ve got a point of view and think I can be helpful where I think we can help bring resources to bear  I m not going to sit there like a wallflower   he said at the town hall 
Scharf  54  took over the CEO role on Oct  21  as the bank entered its fourth year of a wide ranging sales practices scandal 
Approved by regulators and cheered by investors as an outsider who could bring fresh perspective to Wells Fargo s C suite  he must now try to settle outstanding regulatory probes  repair the bank s image and improve morale among staff 
Scharf said he is up to the task 
 We all have to act a little bit more impatient for some of these things  and demand more of each other   he said   I m going to constantly ask the question   Can we do a better job  Can we do something faster   
Scharf came to Wells Fargo after CEO stints at Visa  N V  and Bank of New York Mellon  N BK  and several years working in the top ranks at JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM   His first days on the job were spent at board meetings in St  Louis and then with regulators and senior management at the bank s headquarters in San Francisco  he said 
This week  he met with regulators and politicians in Washington and with other key executives including Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton in Charlotte 
In the town hall meeting  Scharf said he is trying to bring a fresh sense of urgency to solving Wells Fargo s regulatory woes  The bank has already paid billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements  faced 14 consent orders with government agencies and remains under an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet by the U S  Federal Reserve 
Other strategy decisions like growth targets are secondary 
Sources who have worked with Scharf described him has a detail oriented leader who is more at home with numbers than people  However  during he town hall  his first event with the company  Scharf framed himself as a family man who places a lot of value on relationships  especially with his yellow Labrador  Bebe 
Winning over employees is also key for Scharf to achieve operational targets while those matters move toward resolution  Wells Fargo has posted sluggish revenue growth and had trouble cutting expenses since the scandal erupted in September 2016 
Initially  the sales abuses centered around millions of phony customer accounts but eventually revealed overcharges on auto and home loans and other improper practices  In an internal survey this year  just 38  of employees said they felt senior management understood obstacles faced by workers  With roughly 262 000 employees  Wells Fargo has the largest employee base of the major U S  banks ",2019-10-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-wells-fargo-ceo-says-he-wants-to-fix-problems-isnt-a-wallflower-2009338,2009338
200985,422501,V,UK plans fast track visas for migrants working in health service,news,"LONDON  Reuters    Britain said on Friday it would make it easier for migrants to move to the United Kingdom to work in the National Health Service  NHS   helping to offset a possible fall in numbers caused by the exit from the European Union 
The Conservative government is planning to bring in an Australian style points based system in 2021 after leaving the EU in a bid to get tighter control of immigration  an issue which commentators said was a major factor in Britons voting for Brexit three years ago 
The future of the NHS is one of the key issues in the campaign for Britain s general election next month 
About 153 000 of 1 2 million health workers are non British  and critics have said the end of freedom of movement for EU citizens after Brexit would deprive the NHS  one of the world s largest employers  of a vital pool of workers 
At the same time  it was feared that many medical staff who come from other areas of the globe  especially nurses  would fail to meet the strict salary requirements of the new system  About 52 000 of current NHS staff are Asian nationals 
The government said the new NHS Visa  NYSE V  would allow it to control immigration while ensuring there would not be a skills shortage for the health service 
The fast track scheme would halve visa fees to 464 pounds   595  and give applicants preferential treatment and faster decisions 
 These measures are part of our plan for an Australian style points based immigration system that allows us to control numbers while remaining open to vital professions like nurses   Home Secretary  interior minister  Priti Patel said in a statement 
 That means the best of both worlds   attracting talent from around the world so our NHS continues to provide brilliant service while ensuring that it isn t put under strain by opening Britain s borders to the entire world

201093,422609,V,Thailand expects jump in Chinese tourists in Golden Week after year ago lull,news,"By Orathai Sriring and Satawasin Staporncharnchai
BANGKOK  Reuters    Thailand is set to see a jump in visitors from China during the  Golden Week  holidays this week due to relaxation of visa rules and as safety worries after a boat accident last year recede  industry executives said 
While a recent rebound in the number of visitors from China  Thailand s biggest source of tourists  is encouraging for the industry  its outlook is weighed by China s slowing economy and a strong baht   they said 
Chinese tourists accounted for about 27  of Thailand s record 38 3 million arrivals last year  and tourism is a key driver of growth in Southeast Asia s second largest economy 
About 250 000 Chinese tourists are expected to come to Thailand during the long break from October 1 to 7  said Vichit Prakobgosol  president of the Association of Thai Travel Agents  ATTA  
That would be a jump of 38  from the 181 000 Chinese tourists who visited Thailand during the break last year  A boat accident in July 2018 off its resort island of Phuket that killed 47 Chinese tourists dampened arrivals due to safety concerns 
 Compared with last year  we should see a big jump  Visa  NYSE V  fee waivers are also helping   said Vichit 
Thailand has tried to lure back Chinese holidaymakers and to boost the overall sector by waiving visa fees paid by visitors from several countries  including China 
 GRAPHIC   Thailand s total foreign tourists and Chinese tourists   
Supawan Tanomkieatipume  president of the Thai Hotels Association  also expects more than 200 000 Chinese visitors during the break  though hotel bookings remain low 
 There are not many bookings from China yet  probably because the Chinese economy is not that good   she said 
Also  many tourists don t book hotels long in advance  while the strong baht may be a concern for some  she added 
The baht is Asia s best performing currency this year  up 6  against the dollar  It was at 30 64 per dollar on Tuesday 
 If it breaks 30  tourism will be bad   ATTA s Vichit said 
However  he predicts 11 million Chinese tourists this year  up from 10 5 million last year 
Kasikorn Research Center said the number of Chinese tourists is on recovery after hitting a million in August  while Hong Kong s riots could turn more visitors to Thailand 
The government believes higher Chinese visitors will help the number of overall foreign arrivals reach its target of 40 million this year  said government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat ",2019-10-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/thailand-expects-jump-in-chinese-tourists-in-golden-week-after-yearago-lull-1989770,1989770

201125,422641,V,Visa critical of India s move toward no fee debit card transactions,news,"By Nupur Anand
MUMBAI  Reuters    Global card payments group Visa  NYSE V  is critical of the Indian government s decision to boost adoption of electronic payments by requiring banks and card payment networks to offer no fee debit card transactions  a senior Visa executive said 
Last month  India s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that businesses with annual turnover of 500 million rupees will not have to pay a merchant discount rate on debit card and other digital modes of transactions  excluding credit cards 
The discount rate is paid by the merchant to banks  card payment networks  and other financial intermediaries for handling a digital transaction  For debit cards  the fees are on average between 0 40  and 0 80  of the transaction amount  according to industry officials 
 I find the logic a bit fallacious because the cost is not free     I am a firm believer in low economics  but no economics student can believe in no economics   T R  Ramachandran  Visa s India and South Asia head  said on Monday  speaking on a panel at an industry conference 
Ramachandran said if the government  the merchant and the consumer are all saving on the cost of cash via an electronic payments mechanism then the stakeholders should be adequately compensated 
India s Finance Ministry was not immediately reachable for comment on the matter outside of business hours 
Sitharaman had said in her budget speech that the Reserve Bank of India and banks would absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to digital payments 
But industry officials say there is still no clarity on who will pick up the tab 
The no fee debit card plan could hit the fee revenues of banks  which are already burdened with bad loans of about  150 billion 
As of May this year there were 824 9 million debit cards in circulation in India compared with 48 9 million credit cards  according to the Reserve Bank of India ",2019-08-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/visa-critical-of-indias-move-toward-nofee-debit-card-transactions-1958547,1958547

Bitcoin jumped 5 6  to  12 992 8 on the Investing com Index by 8 27 AM ET  12 27 GMT   in a move that lacked clear triggers  It has been on a tear since the Federal Reserve signalled that it would stop raising interest rates  and has continued to gain as the prospect of a new cycle of interest rate cuts has loomed ever larger

Beyond the year s high of  13 929 8  Simpson suggested that current charts pointed to an initial target of around  14 290   But  it  can eventually travel further and is certainly something to consider given the strength of the underlying trend   he said

 While we will still require people to apply to run ads promoting cryptocurrency  starting today  we will narrow this policy to no longer require pre approval for ads related to blockchain technology  industry news  education or events related to cryptocurrency    the social media giant said 
But Facebook will continue to prohibit ads promoting contracts for difference  CFDs  and complex financial products as it said they are often associated with predatory behaviour  Ads for initial coin offerings and binary options will also continued to be banned 
The move came after Facebook is said to be launching its own digital asset  which is believed to be a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar 
Last week  the Wall Street Journal reported that the social media giant is discussing with financial firms and e commerce companies such as Visa  NYSE V  and MasterCard to support its payment service known internally as Project Libra 
The switch in Facebook s attitutde towards cryptocurrency is a contrast to that of its Chinese counterpart  WeChat  This week  the messaging giant updated its payments policy that will prevent merchants on the platform from engaging in cryptocurrency related activities  The policy will take effect on May 31 ",2019-05-09,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/crypto-recovers-facebook-relaxes-crypto-ad-terms-1862048,1862048

The market paused as investors wait to see if digital currencies can continue to hold onto their momentum 
Last Wednesday  the total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit a year to date high of  186 billion  according to CoinMarketCap  before pulling back

The move lower comes amid news that the IMF and World Bank are launching a digital coin to study how alternative currencies work and reports that Visa is teaming up with Coinbase to offer a debit card for users in the U K 
The debit card  which is issued by Visa  will allow Coinbase users to spend their bitcoin  ethereum and litecoin balances  It works by converting the cryptocurrency to fiat when the card is used  with the merchant receiving the local currency 
 This is the first debit card to link directly with a major cryptocurrency exchange  allowing people to spend their crypto balances direct from their Coinbase account   Coinbase said in a statement   Previously available crypto cards required users to pre load a specified amount of crypto onto their card  adding a point of friction to the process  
Meanwhile  the IMF and World Bank have launched a Learning Coin  which the bank will use to understand the technology behind digital assets  The coin has no monetary value and will only be accessible to the IMF and World Bank  the Financial Times reported 
Still  the news is welcome to crypto enthusiasts  as it could help regulators better understand the risks associated with Bitcoin and other assets and lead to more consistent regulation from financial watchdogs 
The testing of the coin could also lead to smart contracts and help the bank combat money laundering ",2019-04-15,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/crypto-wrap-bitcoin-surges-as-imf-launches-pseudo-coin-visa-issues-crypto-card-1836009,1836009

201351,422867,V,Exclusive  U S   China sketch outlines of deal to end trade war   sources,news,"By Jeff Mason WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States and China have started to outline commitments in principle on the stickiest issues in their trade dispute  marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven month trade war  according to sources familiar with the negotiations  The world s two largest economies have slapped tit for tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods  slowing global economic growth  skewing supply chains and disrupting manufacturing  As officials hold high level talks on Thursday and Friday in Washington  they remain far apart on demands made by U S  President Donald Trump s administration for structural changes to China s economy  But the broad outline of what could make up a deal is beginning to emerge from the talks  the sources said  as the two sides push for an agreement by March 1  That marks the end of a 90 day truce that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to when they met in Argentina late last year   Negotiators are drawing up six memorandums of understanding on structural issues  forced technology transfer and cyber theft  intellectual property rights  services  currency  agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade  according to two sources familiar with the progress of the talks  At meetings between U S  and Chinese officials last week in Beijing the two sides traded texts and worked on outlining obligations on paper  according to one of the sources  The process has become a real trade negotiation  the source said  so much so that at the end of the week the participants considered staying in Beijing to keep working  Instead they agreed to take a few days off and reconvene in Washington  The sources requested anonymity to speak candidly about the talks  Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng on Thursday declined to comment on the MOUs   GETTING COMMITMENTS IN WRITING The MOUs cover the most complex issues affecting the trading relationship between the two countries and are meant  from the U S  perspective  to end the practices that led Trump to start levying duties on Chinese imports in the first place  One source cautioned that the talks could still end in failure  But the work on the MOUs was a significant step in getting China to sign up both to broad principles and to specific commitments on key issues  he said  Several Chinese government sources told Reuters that the two countries have basically reached a consensus on alleviating the trade imbalances  but there were still some differences on each other s  core demands  that they were seeking to narrow   It can be said that we are now in the sprint phase  and both negotiating teams are working towards the goal of reaching an agreement within the deadline  but some problems are still quite complicated to resolve   said one Chinese official familiar with the situation  The United States has accused Beijing of forcing U S  companies doing business in China to share their technology with local partners and hand over intellectual property secrets  China denies it engages in such practices  Trump administration officials also object to non tariff barriers in China  including industrial subsidies  regulations  business licensing procedures  product standards reviews and other practices that they say keep U S  goods out of China or give an unfair advantage to domestic firms  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for China to open its financial services markets to more foreign firms  including credit card giants Visa  NYSE V  and MasterCard  which have waited years for China to make good on promises to allow them to operate there  On currency  U S  officials including Mnuchin have warned China against devaluing its yuan to gain a competitive advantage after the Chinese currency weakened significantly against the dollar last year  partly counteracting Trump s tariffs   The two sides were discussing an enforcement mechanism for the deal  the source said  Reuters reported last month that the United States was pushing for regular reviews of China s progress on pledged trade reforms and could reinstate tariffs if it deems Beijing has violated the agreement  The parties also were looking at a 10 item list of ways that China could reduce its trade surplus with the United States  including by buying agricultural produce  energy and goods such as semiconductors  according to two other sources familiar with the talks  CLOCK IS TICKING Time is running short ahead of the March 1 deadline to resolve the dispute or see U S  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods rise from 10 percent to 25 percent  Trump said on Tuesday he thought China had an incentive to move swiftly   I think they re trying to move fast so that doesn t happen   he told reporters in the Oval Office  while not ruling out the possibility of extending the deadline  Lower level officials held a round of talks in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday  They will be joined on Thursday by the top level negotiators  led by U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  One senior Chinese government official familiar with the talks said that extending the deadline was an option  though both sides were trying to reach agreement before March 1 and any extension would not be too long  
It is possible the talks won t resolve all the differences  and it will be up to the two heads of state to make a final decision  the official said ",2019-02-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/exclusive-us-china-sketch-outlines-of-deal-to-end-trade-war--sources-1785667,1785667

Average home prices rose just 0 9 percent to 305 522 pounds   384 000  compared with November 2017  the smallest annual increase since April 2012  Acadata said 
Rightmove said the price of property put up for sale has fallen by 3 2 percent over the past two months  leaving asking prices almost 10 000 pounds lower on average than in October  In London  19 percent fewer properties came to market this month than a year earlier 
Silver Lining
Fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal in March have hit the housing market at a time when affordability was already stretched  particularly in London  Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to get parliamentary backing for her deal and there little sign that the EU is prepared to offer sufficient concession to break the stalemate 
There were some silver linings amid the housing market gloom  According to Rightmove  sales agreed by agents fell by  a relatively marginal  2 1 percent annually  a sign bargain hunters are looking for deals  Acadata too reported renewed buyer interest  with transactions at the highest for any November in three years

201442,422958,V,U S  issues fewer student visas to Iranians despite exemption,news,By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin and Yeganeh Torbati LONDON WASHINGTON  Reuters    With offers from four American universities  Mani Rezaei Rad gave up his well paid job with a Siemens affiliate company in Tehran last year and proposed to his girlfriend so they could be together while he studied in the United States  Getting a U S  student visa normally takes a few months  but 16 months later  he was still waiting  The uncertainty and lack of work took its toll on the relationship and the couple split   I was sliding into depression  I felt hollow and useless   said Rezaei Rad  who had won places to study for a post graduate degree in electrical engineering  Eventually he gave up his American dream and got a place at a European university instead  Thousands of Iranians study in the United States each year  one of the few gates that has been kept open since the two countries cut diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iran s Islamic Revolution the year before  Iranian students are exempt from a travel ban initially introduced by President Donald Trump in 2017  which largely bars citizens of Iran  Libya  North Korea  Somalia  Syria and Yemen  as well as a small number of Venezuelans  Data from the Institute of International Education  IIE   which tracks foreign students in the United States  shows that the number of Iranians studying in the country is the highest in decades  at 12 800  But there are signs it is on the wane  State Department data showed that 355 fewer F1 student visas were granted to Iranians from March October than the same period last year  a 23 percent drop  it compares with a five percent drop for foreign students overall  a more normal fluctuation  A wider total incorporating visas for Iranian students and their dependents has fallen for the past three school years  Meanwhile  several European universities said the number of Iranians studying there had gone up  Reuters has found more than two dozen cases where Iranian U S  student visa applications were subject to delays  Asked about such delays  a State Department official said security was paramount  IRANIANS  EVERY ONE Trump withdrew this year from an international deal to curb Iran s nuclear program and re imposed sanctions  signaling the end of a wary detente between Washington and Tehran and a new phase of confrontation  Visa  NYSE V  ban exemptions  such as the one covering Iranian students  were cited by the Trump administration in the Supreme Court this year in countering allegations the policy constituted a  Muslim ban  akin to what Trump had called for during the 2016 presidential campaign  Lawyers for the government argued in one brief to the Supreme Court that Trump s policy  does not impose blanket bans but allows entry of some classes of nationals from the covered countries   The Supreme Court  in a 5 to 4 split  allowed the ban to go forward in June  The State Department does not publish visa application numbers  making it hard to assess how much of the drop in the number of study visas granted to Iranians is due to rejections or delays and how much is because fewer of them are applying  American universities enjoy an elite reputation in Iran and welcome its students  many of whom take courses in engineering and go on to fill skills shortages in the U S  and elsewhere  Back in Iran  they counterbalance powerful conservative religious forces and provide a bridge to the West for future rapprochement  In the lead up to the 2015 international nuclear deal  six out of 25 members of President Hassan Rouhani s 2014 cabinet held U S  degrees  Twelve Iranians with places at U S  universities told Reuters their visa applications were  under administrative processing  for extended periods  a term that generally refers to extensive background checks  Separately  around 15 Iranians hoping to study at Oklahoma State University this fall had visa delays  a university official said  Regina Henry  the immigration coordinator at OSU s international students office  said she wrote letters giving them permission to arrive two weeks late  But that window was not enough for any of the 15  Typically  Henry has to write a maximum of five such letters each semester   This is the first time I ve ever had to write so many and they were all Iranians  every one of them   she said  Some department heads at the university were becoming more hesitant to grant coveted graduate assistant positions to Iranian applicants  she said  even if they were their first choice  given the visa trouble they face  A State Department official at the Bureau of Consular Affairs  when asked about the delays  said on condition of anonymity that national security was the top priority when adjudicating visa applications   We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes and to support legitimate travel and immigration to the United States while protecting U S  citizens   the official said   TIPPING POINT  Historical data  which tracks the wider F category of visas granted to students and their dependents  shows that issuance of such visas to Iranians began falling in the year to end Sept 2015 after rising several years in a row  After a one percent drop that year  it fell by 17 percent and 16 percent respectively the two following years  Washington has placed restrictions on Iranian students for years  a 2012 law signed by former U S  President Barack Obama barred granting visas to Iranians to study fields that would prepare them for working in Iran s energy sector  nuclear science  or nuclear engineering  Yet the school year after that saw a 17 percent jump in the number of Iranian students in the United States  IIE data show  European signatories of the nuclear deal are still committed to the accord and are trying to create a financial mechanism to protect trade with Tehran against U S  penalties  Security concerns are less of a problem for Iranians in Europe  After he gave up on a U S  visa  Rezaei Rad got one from Spain in just four weeks to study at a university in Barcelona  Dutch universities admitted 82 more Iranian students in 2017  data from educational non profit group Nuffic showed  while Germany s Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich said it had 20 more Iranians enrolled this year  Uppsala University in Sweden said 135 more Iranians applied in 2018 compared with 2016  and Humboldt University of Berlin and Eberhard Karls University of T binge in Germany also said numbers had risen  Some people are still holding out for a U S  place  Tehran resident Abbas was admitted to an American university and applied for a U S  visa last year  but was still waiting when this year s enrolment came and went   I have lost two years of study so far   the 31 year old said by telephone  withholding his full name for fear his comments might affect his application

201522,423038,V,Bahrain minister backs boycott of Uber over Khashoggi case,news,"DUBAI  Reuters    Bahrain s foreign minister called for a boycott of the ride hailing company Uber Technologies  UBER UL  after its chief executive officer said he will not attend a business conference in the kingdom s ally Saudi Arabia 
Uber s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement last week he is pulling out of the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia because of growing outrage over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist in Turkey 
Saudi Arabia s sovereign wealth fund  the Public Investment Fund  which hosts the conference  invested  3 5 billion in Uber in 2016  making it one of the company s largest investors 
Other companies and high profile businessmen have pulled out of the three day conference known as  Davos in the desert   which is scheduled to begin on Oct  23 in Riyadh 
Foreign minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa tweeted two hashtags calling for a boycott of Uber in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia  as well as a broader hashtag urging followers to  boycott anyone who boycotts Saudi Arabia  
It was unclear if the boycott call was aimed at users of Uber s service or investors in the company  or both  and whether Bahrain is planning other measures against the company 
Similar campaigns have been trending on social media in Saudi Arabia and the UAE  although there has been no official backing so far 
Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor  a prominent UAE businessman  also urged boycotts of companies pulling out of the FII conference  including of Uber and Virgin  VA UL  
 Now it is time for GCC  Gulf Cooperation Council  to prove their loyalty by boycotting Virgin and Uber and all the companies pulling out of KSA    Together we can prove our unity and that we cannot be bullied   he said in a Twitter post 
Uber declined to comment  Virgin Atlantic  which operates flights between Dubai and London but will withdraw the service from March 31  2019  did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
On Sunday   JP Morgan Chase   NYSE JPM    Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon became the latest high profile participant to cancel plans to attend the FII  following the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi 
Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co Chairman Bill Ford also pulled out  as well as media organizations like CNN and Bloomberg which once served as sponsors of the conference 
Uber s absence carries a special sting  given both the size of the Saudi investment and its significance for the kingdom s economic reform plans 
The Uber investment was the PIF s first major deal in the technology start up market  signaling its shift in strategy toward more aggressive and eye catching foreign investments  It was also a boon for Saudi women  who had been barred from driving until a decades long ban was lifted this summer 
Khashoggi  a prominent Saudi journalist  disappeared after entering the kingdom s consulate in Istanbul on Oct  2 
Turkish officials have said Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate  where he went to get documents for his planned marriage  Riyadh has said the claims are baseless 

Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates are Riyadh s closest Gulf Arab allies and the three countries are working alongside each other in a series of conflicts in Yemen  Qatar and Lebanon to try to counter the influence of arch rival Iran ",2018-10-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/bahrain-minister-backs-boycott-of-uber-over-khashoggi-case-1643807,1643807

201524,423040,V,YOUR MONEY   Comic heroes teach kids about finance,news,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK  Reuters    As any parent knows  getting children to focus can be challenging   even more so when it involves topics like monetary systems 
But comics are kid friendly  and the New York Federal Reserve is using them to teach financial principles that baffle even adults 
 We re not trying to create junior economists here   said Anand Marri  who directs outreach programs at the New York branch of the U S  central bank   Our job is to promote economic literacy  so we can have a citizenry that understands the economic forces affecting people s lives  These comics are a vehicle for that  
Marri s team unearthed a treasure trove of material from the 1950s and updated them for a new generation 
The first comic   Once Upon a Dime   released in 2017  is set in the planet Novus  whose fast growing economy is driving its residents to adopt monetary systems for the easy exchange of goods and services 
This year s sequel   The Story of the Federal Reserve System   may not have the most exciting title  but is drama filled as a financial crisis forces the aliens to travel to Earth to study our central banks for solutions 
A third comic  due out in the first quarter  tackles how central banks tweak interest rates  by lowering them to stimulate lending and growth  or raising them to stem inflation 
More comics may come  depending on the response  Marri said 
The comics can be downloaded on the New York Fed website     Hard copies may be sent  free of charge  to teachers for classrooms  So far 70 000 digital and hard copies have been distributed 
 Tools like comic books are great because they get a conversation started and piques kids  interest  and sometimes that s the hardest part   said Laura Levine  president and chief executive of the Jump tart Coalition  a Washington nonprofit that promotes youth financial literacy 
Marvel Entertainment and credit card company Visa  NYSE V  partnered in 2016 to release one such comic  titled  Rocket s Powerful Plan   In it  characters from the popular Guardians of the Galaxy franchise discussed everyday money issues like saving  spending and budgeting 
Levine won over eighth graders at a recent school Career Day by bringing a stack of comics   Those really saved me   she said   When I said   Look  I have comic books   suddenly I was everybody s favorite  
FEEDBACK
Kids I talked to were impressed with the imaginative way the comics explained a subject they usually find boring 
Using aliens to tell the story was a wise choice  my 12 year old Zach said   That s the type of stuff kids are into   He enjoyed the trivia such as the tons of gold stashed in vaults below Manhattan  and what the tiny numbers on a dollar bill mean 
Zach does not  however  see any Marvel like movie potential in the comics  which he said were too dense in parts   A battle would have made it better   he said 
The comic book format makes the material much more interesting than a textbook  Aidan Wohl  13  said  But he questioned narrative choices such as having an alien explain central banking through song 

In the end  Aidan was not fully convinced that central banks are a foolproof solution to any planet s economic crisis   Maybe 80 percent  ",2018-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/your-money--comic-heroes-teach-kids-about-finance-1646368,1646368

201881,423397,V,Money laundering rule on prepaid cards stalled after industry pushback,news,"By Mica Rosenberg and Brett Wolf NEW YORK ST  LOUIS  AUGUST 10  Reuters    In 2011  amid a crackdown on international money laundering  the U S  Treasury Department tried to close a loophole that authorities said allows drug cartels to move bulk cash across borders on gift and other prepaid cards  The department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  FinCEN  proposed that money stored on these cards count toward a U S  requirement to report cross border movement of cash of  10 000 or more  But FinCEN later withdrew its proposed rule after pushback from the prepaid card industry  according to law enforcement sources  The move has not been previously reported  In response to questions from Reuters  FinCEN spokesman Stephen Hudak said the rule was being reworked and would be resubmitted  possibly by 2017   It s not dead   Hudak said  The lack of a rule has stymied efforts to crack down on cross border crime  including drug trafficking and money laundering  law enforcement officials said  The U S  Department of Justice estimated in 2009 that up to  24 billion in cash is smuggled into Mexico each year  some of it on prepaid cards  The use of the cards has grown steadily in recent years  More than  623 billion was loaded on gift cards and other types of prepaid cards in the United States in 2015  according to data from the Massachusetts based Mercator Advisory Group  For a graphic on prepaid cards    The prepaid card industry opposed the rule  saying it would have discouraged people from using the cards   Implementing onerous requirements on reloadable prepaid cards could disproportionately harm vulnerable consumers  who rely on these products as their sole means of access to the financial services system   said Brad Fauss  President and CEO of the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association  In March 2013  two years after FinCEN proposed amending the Bank Secrecy Act with the new rule  industry representatives met with officials from FinCEN and the Department of Homeland Security at the Office of Management and Budget  OMB   which reviews regulations  according to a record of the meeting topic  date and attendees published on a White House website   Visa Inc    N V   the world s largest payments network operator and a major brand on prepaid cards  was the most vocal opponent at the meeting  according to a person who attended  Any member of the public can request a meeting about a regulatory action under review  and the OMB views these meetings as listening sessions  In November 2014  FinCEN withdrew its proposal  FinCEN s Hudak declined to comment on the meeting  He said the agency withdrew the rule  for further consideration and analysis of the benefits and costs   Meetings between OMB and parties with a stake in proposed regulations are common  and it often takes years for an agency to complete the review of proposed regulations  But it is unusual for agencies to withdraw rules once they are proposed  Over the past decade  less than 6 percent of draft regulations were withdrawn by the agency that proposed them  according to OMB statistics  In exchanges with law enforcement officials   FinCEN just regurgitated the same arguments that the industry put out there   said a law enforcement source who asked not to be quoted on relationships with regulators  A Visa spokeswoman declined to comment on the meeting  She said Visa s prepaid cards  are in full compliance with the law and are designed to deter illegal activities such as money laundering   LIMITED DATA Prepaid cards come in a variety of forms  So called  open loop  cards carry credit card company logos and are re loadable  Gift cards that can be used at specific outlets are known as  closed loop  cards  Fauss  president of the prepaid card association  said that  unlike cash  open loop cards can not be used anonymously because they require vendors to collect purchasers  identification  Law enforcement officials said they have little information about how often the cards are used for illicit transfers  and the rule would have shed light on how often the cards are crossing borders  During the routine 60 day public comment period on the rule in 2011  U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement submitted one comment supporting the rule  Industry groups and card companies submitted a dozen opposing it  The industry said it would be difficult to implement because  in order to check balances  border agents would need card scanners  which are expensive and invade customer privacy  It said cross border tracking was unnecessary because card companies already have implemented load limits and other controls  The industry also argued the rule could unfairly affect the poor  Prepaid cards can be used for U S  government benefits and payrolls for workers without bank accounts  This type of argument has been raised more broadly by financial institutions claiming overzealous money laundering regulation has led to  de risking   where banks pull out of certain lines of business and even parts of the world  leaving few options for some customers   L1N19X1DD   The proposed rule could result in bank issued prepaid cards being stigmatized as second class financial products in comparison to debit cards and credit cards   wrote Alex Miller  Visa s then associate General Counsel in one of the 2011 comment letters  The industry also opposed bipartisan Congressional legislation in 2010 calling for controls on prepaid cards  The bills died after the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association lobbied against them  according to records compiled by the nonprofit organization Center for Responsive Politics  Senator Chuck Grassley  a Republican from Iowa  co chaired a 2011 Senate Caucus hearing on money laundering that aired concerns about prepaid cards  He did not know FinCEN had withdrawn its proposed regulation until he and Senator Dianne Feinstein  a Democrat from California  sent letters last year to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the OMB asking about it  a Grassley spokeswoman said   The long delays in finalizing regulations to crack down on this practice are frustrating to those of us who want to stop this way of laundering criminal proceeds   Grassley said in an emailed statement  In 2011  Kumar Kibble  then Deputy Director at U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified in Congress that authorities had found hundreds of the cards hidden  in a compartment similar to those used to conceal cash  drugs and other contraband   John Tobon  deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Miami  said the cards can be used to pay couriers smuggling money  drugs or other merchandise as large cash transactions come under greater scrutiny   L1N1AD1VV  He said the European Union has become concerned about the use of the cards in recent terror plots  The EU recently published a proposal that would increase regulation of the cards in member states   
 The regulations are absolutely still necessary   Tobon said ",2016-08-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/money-laundering-rule-on-prepaid-cards-stalled-after-industry-pushback-419465,419465

March 2008 
 Santander is the third largest private sector bank in
Brazil by assets  with a 10 2 percent market share  behind Itau
Unibanco  and Bradesco  
 The bank has expanded with six takeovers in Brazil the past
12 years  including the acquisition of Sao Paulo state bank
Banespa in 2000 for 7 billion reais 
 Santander purchased ABN Amro s Banco Real unit in Brazil in
2008 as part of its 70 billion euro bid for the Dutch firm with
Royal Bank of Scotland and Belgian Dutch Fortis 
 The Brazilian unit has emerged as one of the most
profitable parts of Santander  accounting for 20 percent of its
net income in the first half of 2009 
 Banco Santander expects net IPO proceeds of  6 8 billion 
and will use about 70 percent of the funds to expand its
network of branches and install automatic teller machines  It
will also use some of the proceeds to improve its capital
ratios  according to its U S  regulatory filing 
 Banco Santander had 3 603 full service branches and smaller
service centers in Brazil as of December 2008 
 In the six months ended in June 2009  Santander s Brazilian
unit reported net interest income of  5 5 billion and profits
of  1 25 billion 
    1 1 75 reais
