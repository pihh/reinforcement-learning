3807,225322,MKC, Death Cross   growth abroad threaten U S  dollar,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss
NEW YORK  Reuters    Storm clouds are gathering over the U S  dollar  threatening a two year rally in the currency that has squeezed corporate profits and angered President Donald Trump 
Dollar bullishness in future markets stands at its lowest level in more than a year and a half  according to the most recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission measuring the net dollar amount of bets on a rising greenback 
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  say the dollar triggered a so called  Death Cross  on the last day of 2019  The bearish technical formation occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200 day moving average  something that has been followed by a period of dollar weakness in seven out of eight instances since 1980  the bank said in a recent report 
Easing worries over global trade and Brexit are stoking investor appetite for risk  pushing them out of safe haven assets like the dollar  said Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities 
 The global economy looks like it s healing   he said   The reduction of uncertainty will likely allow investors to take risks     they didn t want to take before  
Because of the dollar s central role in the global financial system  gauging its path is important for corporations and investors  Over the last several years  the currency has withstood a number of factors that analysts believed would pull it lower  including a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve and fears of a U S  growth slowdown 
The ICE  NYSE ICE  Dollar Index edged 0 2  higher last year and was up around 10  from its 2018 low

UBS   Schroders   LON SDR  and Soci t  G n rale are among banks calling for the dollar to fall this year  DoubleLine Capital s Jeffrey Gundlach has also told investors he believes the dollar s next big move will be lower  
The buck s long stay near the top of its trading range has weighed on the balance sheets of multinationals like Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  and Whirlpool Corp  N WHR   making it less profitable for them to convert foreign earnings into dollars 
Trump has complained about the dollar s strength  in part because it makes U S  products less competitive abroad  An index that measures the dollar against the currencies of the largest U S  trading partners stands near an all time high 
Momtchil Pojarliev  head of currencies at BNP Asset Management  believes that trend will soon reverse  He is betting the dollar will fall against the euro  Japanese yen and Australian dollar as growth in those countries accelerates and their central banks raise interest rates while the Federal Reserve keeps them steady  That should narrow the gap in yields that has buoyed the U S  currency  
A few central banks already appear to be shifting to a less dovish stance  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised investors when it left rates unchanged at its November meeting  while Sweden s central bank last month became the first to raise rates back to zero from negative territory 
The European Central Bank  for its part  has signaled that it is done cutting rates for now 
Richard Benson  co chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London  likes a range of emerging market currencies  including the Mexican peso and Indian rupee  He expects the currencies of developing countries to rise against the dollar as global growth picks up

Others though believe that any dollar weakness will be short lived 
Lee Ferridge  North American head of multi asset strategy at  State Street   NYSE STT  Global Markets in Boston  doubts that yield spreads between the United States and other developed countries will narrow enough to dent the dollar s appeal 






In fact  a sharp slowdown in U S  growth would likely send nervous investors back into the dollar  he said ",2020-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/death-cross-growth-abroad-threaten-us-dollar-2064534,2064534
3810,225325,MKC,Bank of Canada rate cut bets sink as investors eye post election spending,news,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO  Reuters    Investors are ditching bets that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates over the coming months as the domestic economy shows resilience and the federal election result adds to prospects of growth boosting fiscal spending next year 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s Liberal government  already planning to run longer and deeper deficits  will need to cater to left leaning parties  such as the New Democratic Party  NDP   in return for support after it lost its majority in Parliament in Monday s election 
 The resulting higher spending and larger deficits may give a temporary lift to growth next year  but will also likely keep the Bank of Canada on hold for longer   said Doug Porter  chief economist at BMO Capital Markets 
Trudeau s election platform planned to nearly double the deficit to C 27 4 billion   21 billion  in the next fiscal year  including higher spending on measures such as old age security and an increase in the amount of money that Canadians would be able to earn before paying tax 
The NDP wants to invest C 15 billion in climate change measures and create a national pharmacare program  a measure that the Liberals also support 
The Bank of Canada has left its benchmark interest rate on hold this year as Canada added jobs at a robust pace and inflation stayed close to the central bank s 2  target 
On Tuesday  a Bank of Canada survey said that Canadian firms expect a moderate increase in sales growth over the coming year 
Money markets see almost no chance that the central bank will cut interest rates at the Oct  30 policy announcement  Chances of a cut by December have fallen to about 10  from more than 90  before the Bank of Canada s last rate announcement in September 
Still  strategists see limits to how much the Bank of Canada can diverge from other central banks  such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank  that have already eased 
The Bank of Canada has been worried about the impact on Canada s economy of slower global growth due to the trade war between the United States and China 
But if there is no escalation in the trade war and Canada gets fiscal stimulus  then the central bank could choose to cut just once rather than multiple times  Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities  told Reuters 
 They could classify it as an insurance cut  or cushioning the blow   McCormick said ",2019-10-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/bank-of-canada-rate-cut-bets-sink-as-investors-eye-postelection-spending-2001521,2001521

BOSTON  Reuters    A senior Blackstone Group  N BX  executive who oversaw special situations investments at the private equity giant s hedge fund unit Blackstone Alternative Asset Management  has left the firm  two people familiar with the matter said 
Greg Geiling was a senior managing director and Head of the Hedge Fund Solutions Special Situations Investing Group  which oversees the Blackstone Strategic Opportunity fund 
He resigned from Blackstone earlier this year and left the firm last week  the sources said  It could not be learned which firm he plans to join next 
Geiling declined to comment  as did Blackstone 
During his nine years at Blackstone  Geiling  47  helped launch the Strategic Opportunity fund  which invests more than  10 billion on behalf of public and private pensions and sovereign wealth funds 
The fund made waves in the hedge fund industry by investing alongside some of the industry s best known hedge fund managers in their best ideas 
Hedge funds are often unable to super size their favorite investments because such big bets could overstep their own risk requirements  Big investors liked the idea of putting money to work in this way and have allocated cash to the Blackstone fund which has largely made credit oriented bets and put money into private  less liquid investments over the years 
Geiling joined Blackstone in early 2011 after having worked for prominent macro investor Stanley Druckenmiller s Duquesne Capital hedge fund 
Since early 2018  Blackstone has made some changes to its most senior ranks  Jon Gray  the firm s former real estate chief  was promoted to president in 2018 and John McCormick  NYSE MKC  took over the reins at the hedge fund unit  which invests more than  80 billion  from long time chief Tomilson Hill last year ",2019-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackstone-special-situations-executive-geiling-leaves-firm--sources-2002559,2002559

3814,225329,MKC,Loonie to extend this year s rally if global risks abate  Reuters poll,news,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO  Reuters    The Canadian dollar will add to this year s gains over the coming 12 months as a potential easing of global economic risk reduces pressure on the Bank of Canada to provide support for Canada s commodity linked economy  a Reuters poll showed 
The poll of nearly 40 currency analysts showed they expect the loonie to strengthen 1 5  to 1 30 per U S  dollar  or 76 92 U S  cents  in one year  from about 1 32 on Thursday  That matches the projection in November s poll 
 We are seeing global growth headwinds start to subside   said Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   global head of FX strategy at TD Securities 
If that were to transition into a better outlook for the global economy then  that environment would pull the Canadian dollar along   McCormick said 
Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major exporter of commodities  including oil  so its economy could benefit from a pickup in global growth 
Developments that could spur an improved outlook include greater clarity around Brexit and calming of the trade war between the United States and China  strategists said 
 We assume a narrow  U S  China  trade deal in 2020 prior to the federal election in the U S    said Simon Harvey  FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada   That will prompt a risk rally impacting crude markets  a marginal weakening of the U S  dollar and a reduction in the external headwinds that face the Bank of Canada s current outlook on the economy  
On Wednesday  Canada s central bank said trade conflicts remained the biggest source of risk to the outlook but cited signs of global economic stabilization as it left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 75  
The bank has stayed on hold this year even as many of its global peers  including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank  have eased  Its relatively hawkish stance has helped support the Canadian dollar  which has been the top performing G10 currency this year with a gain of more than 3  against the greenback 
Last week  a slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll expected Canada s central bank to leave interest rates on hold through to the end of next year   CA POLL 
Over the same period  money markets see about a 50  chance the central bank would cut rates  In September  the market was bracing for as many as three rate cuts

3817,225332,MKC,Explainer  Mexico s week of bloodshed  What is going on ,news,"By Anthony Esposito MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December  promising not to repeat the  failed policies  of past administrations that have done little to stem a tide of drug related violence that cost some 29 000 lives last year  But events in the states of Sinaloa  Michoacan and Guerrero this past week  including two mass killings and an all out gun battle on Thursday that saw security forces overwhelmed by cartel gunmen  have raised questions about the effectiveness of his new security strategy   Graphic  Bungled arrest of kingpin s son  click   WHAT HAPPENED IN MEXICO THIS PAST WEEK  On Monday  cartel hitmen shot dead at least 13 police in an ambush in Aguililla in the western state of Michoacan  long convulsed by turf wars between drug gangs  latterly the Jalisco New Generation Cartel  CJNG  and its enemies  The following day  a gunfight left 14 civilians and one soldier dead in Tepochica  near Iguala  a city notorious for the 2014 disappearances of 43 student teachers  Tuesday s mass killing in Guerrero raised questions about whether the armed forces used excessive force  reviving the specter of past executions  Then came the bungled arrest on Thursday of the son of jailed kingpin Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman that turned the streets of Culiacan in Sinaloa into a scene of nightmarish urban warfare  Cartel gunmen surrounded security forces in the northwestern city and made them free Ovidio Guzman after his brief capture  WHAT S THIS NEW SECURITY STRATEGY  Veteran leftist Lopez Obrador s new strategy for battling crime focuses on addressing the root causes of violence  in particular reducing poverty  stamping out entrenched corruption  and giving young adults job opportunities  He has boosted wages along the U S  Mexico border  created thousands of apprenticeships  and is promoting investments in the impoverished south  He says he believes in the inherent good of all Mexicans  and says  you can t fight fire with fire   and  hugs not bullets    As well as his emphasis on combating the social ills that spark violence  he has created a new National Guard force that replaces the federal police and has absorbed thousands of soldiers  IS IT WORKING  Not so far  Homicides in 2019 are on track to surpass last year s record   Analysts warn the government has not clearly explained how it will use the National Guard to outsmart the cartels  With no clear short term strategy  there is a sense on the ground that this government is less tough on gangs  said Falko Ernst  Mexico analyst with the International Crisis Group  who has done extensive fieldwork in crime wracked states   The inertia and lack of definition of a security strategy by the government has allowed regional armed conflicts to spin out of control   Ernst said   Criminal group members and commanders have told me in Michoacan and in Guerrero that this  inertia  has meant a looser leash   Additionally  many of the National Guard have been rerouted to deal with a wave of illegal migration through Mexico at the behest of U S  President Donald Trump   WHEN DID THIS START  Lopez Obrador regularly heaps blame on previous governments for the delicate security situation in Mexico  Mexico s  War on Drugs  started in 2006 with former President Felipe Calderon  who sent in armed forces to tackle the increasingly powerful drug cartels  which had shifted gears from smuggling cocaine for the Colombian cartels to becoming full narcotrafficking operations themselves  Since then  more than 200 000 people have been killed in gang fueled violence and over 40 000 are missing  The crackdown led to the splintering of Mexico s cartels and some notable wins for the government  including the arrest of  El Chapo  Guzman  He escaped twice from jail in Mexico before being extradited to the United States  where he was found guilty in February of smuggling drugs and sentenced to life in prison  The U S  government says that under Guzman s leadership  the Sinaloa cartel imported and distributed tons of cocaine  marijuana  methamphetamine and heroin in the United States over more than two decades  DIDN T JAILING EL CHAPO PUT AN END TO THE VIOLENCE  The extradition of Guzman was a double edged sword  It  appears to have led to violent competition from a competing cartel  the CJNG   according to an August report prepared by the U S  Congressional Research Service  The CJNG had split from Sinaloa in 2010 and is considered by many analysts to now be the most dangerous and largest Mexican cartel   Photos of Monday s police ambush published on social media showed shot up and burning police vehicles  as well as the slain officers  They also showed large placards signed  CJNG   left on police vehicles  which warned police not to support rival crime groups  including Michoacan based Los Viagras  And even after Guzman was locked away for life in a Colorado prison known as  the Alcatraz of the Rockies   the cartel he founded has flourished  The Sinaloa cartel  has fought brutally for increased control of routes through the border states of Chihuahua and Baja California  with the goal of remaining the dominant drug trafficking organization   the Congressional Research Service report said  The cartel s decentralized structure had allowed it to adapt  the report added  Within this decentralized structure  Ovidio Guzman  one of  El Chapo  Guzman s at least 12 children  appears to have taken an active role  The U S  Department of Justice unveiled an indictment against Ovidio and one of his brothers in February  charging them with conspiracy to distribute cocaine  methamphetamine  and marijuana in the United States  
Security analyst Gladys McCormick  NYSE MKC  at Syracuse University in the United States said Thursday s apparent capitulation to the Sinaloa Cartel was  sending a loud message to other organized crime networks    that if they show up with enough firepower to a fight  they will win and get their way because the government does not have the wherewithal to fight back  ",2019-10-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/explainer-mexicos-week-of-bloodshed-what-is-going-on-1999560,1999560

121944,343459,MKC,Yield Hunters Push Bond Safeguards to the Brink,news," Bloomberg Opinion      Worrisome    Dangerous and aggressive    Abuse of documentation    Peak greed  
These are just a few of the ways investors and analysts have described the riskiest corners of the debt markets in the past few days  From the U S  to Europe  whether in collateralized loan obligations or junk bonds  the feeling that the reach for yield in fixed income is fast approaching a breaking point is becoming too powerful to ignore  It s perhaps best encapsulated by a quote in the Wall Street Journal from Luca Cazzulani  a senior fixed income strategist at UniCredit   Investors are not really interested in safety  they are quite keen on yield   
That s good  I guess  Because for those who still favor strong credit protection  it s getting harder and harder to find it  
Let s start with CLOs  Bloomberg News s Adam Tempkin had an in depth article this week with the headline  CLOs Are Packed With New Loopholes  Triggering Investor Backlash   He reported that investors  analysts and credit raters are taken aback by managers  efforts to  swap troubled loans  circumvent credit quality limitations  and double down on risky wagers  largely in an effort to ensure they can pass crucial compliance tests  even if a large swath of a CLO s underlying loans lose value   Many understand that having a bit of flexibility in an illiquid market is a good thing when prices fluctuate but argue that provisions like these create the potential for severe losses if the credit cycle truly turns 
The same problem plagues the market for speculative grade corporate bonds  Covenant Review  an independent research firm that analyzes debt documents for investors  published its 2019 year in review for the U S  high yield market this week and found many cases in which companies  ended up keeping some of the most dangerous and aggressive covenant provisions for bondholders   A common strategy was for issuers to propose so many offensive covenants that even after a  hack and slash treatment to appease concerned bond investors   they still got away with far more questionable terms than in the past 
It would be one thing if bond investors were compensated for those risks   giving up some safety for yield is a classic trade off  But  of course  that s not the case 
Rather  the yield on an index of double B U S  corporate bonds hit a record low of 3 47  this week  VICI Properties  a double B rated real estate company that develops entertainment and hospitality centers  priced  750 million of five year bonds with a 3 5  coupon  the lowest for that maturity in more than six years  To be clear  it s not any better elsewhere up the credit spectrum  as yields on a Moody s Corp  index of triple B corporate bonds and a Bond Buyer index of  municipal debt are both around the lowest since 1956  Even triple C yields have fallen by 200 basis points in two months 
Record setting interest rates aren t limited to America  In Austria  as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Marcus Ashworth  wrote  Erste Group Bank AG priced a so called CoCo bond to yield 3 375   the second lowest coupon ever for the risky debt  And European high yield bond sales are poised to top   11 billion this month  the most ever for January 
By now  it s possible that the  100 trillion global bond market has simply become immune to reaching unprecedented levels  But the potential for complacency is scary  especially when someone like Bob Prince  who helps oversee the world s biggest hedge fund at Bridgewater Associates   declares that the days of a boom and bust economic cycle are over 
This brings to mind a piece of investing advice that has always stuck with me  Bull markets don t end when everyone is on high alert for what could go wrong  It s when everyone willfully chooses to ignore those warning signs that the cycle inevitably turns  
The combination of weak credit protections and historically low yields on the riskiest corporate debt should be a clear red flag  Instead  when asked about financial market bubbles  the one thing that came to mind for JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was negative yielding sovereign obligations   Do you know anyone who s actually bought a negative interest rate bond   he asked CNBC s Andrew Ross Sorkin   I would never buy a negative rate bond  Not unless I was forced   1 
I get it  It s tempting to bash negative yielding bonds and anyone who owns them  Even though it has been several years since sovereign debt yields fell below zero in Japan and some European countries  the concept still boggles the minds of Wall Street veterans  Who would purchase a security that locks in a loss if held to maturity 
But I would pose the same question to buyers of speculative grade securities at these rock bottom yields  If you re still of the mind that economic cycles exist  then it stands to reason that the longest expansion in U S  history is long in the tooth  Will a sub 3 5  yield on double B bonds  or sub 5  on single B bonds  be enough to cancel out principal haircuts in the case of default  Perhaps  But it s worth remembering that lending to the wrong companies can also lead to losses   and possibly large ones   even if dicey companies have largely avoided disaster in recent years 
Now  there are some nascent signs that investors are anxious about their ability to pick winners after years of just about every wager paying off  Bloomberg News s Caleb Mutua this week  highlighted research from  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc that showed junk bonds experienced a much sharper sell off when downgraded in 2019 than in previous years  Usually  bond traders pride themselves on having superior information and being ahead of the credit raters  That confidence might be wavering 
Whether those fleeting jitters turn into anything more remains to be seen  Certainly  the Federal Reserve and other central banks aren t about to do anything to derail the economic expansion with inflation still in check  And as long as yields and spreads remain near these lows  investors probably won t lose much sleep over the daunting record  1 2 trillion of U S  speculative grade debt that s set to mature through 2024 
Yet just because there s no clear catalyst for a reversal today doesn t mean investors are safe from a nightmare scenario in the future  At the very least  they should push for stronger protections when they buy new bonds or loans  As it stands  if and when the credit cycle turns and the losses mount  they ll have no one to blame but themselves 
 1  Bloomberg News s Liz Capo McCormick  NYSE MKC  quickly pointed out that plenty of Americans own negative yielding debt  through Vanguard s Total International Bond Index Fund ",2020-01-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/yield-hunters-push-bond-safeguards-to-the-brink-2066984,2066984

After that  I ll turn it over to Mike  who will go in more depth on the quarter end results and the details of our 2020 guidance  Let s start with our fourth quarter results on Slide 6  Starting with our top line  versus the year ago period  we grew sales 1  for the total company including a 1  unfavorable impact from currency  In constant currency  we grew sales 2   with both segments contributing to the increase  In addition to our top line growth  we grew adjusted operating income and expanded our adjusted operating margin  Higher sales  cost savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program  or CCI  drove the growth  which was partially offset by higher brand marketing expense  At the bottom line  our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of  1 61 was lower than  1 67 in the prior period or a decline of 4   This decline includes a 7  headwind from a higher adjusted tax rate  Our adjusted operating income growth was more than offset by this tax headwind  Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance  In our consumer segment  we grew our constant currency sales 2  in the fourth quarter driven by the Americas and Asia Pacific regions  The Americas  we grew constant currency sales 2   attributable to higher volume and product mix driven by both our base business and new products  Our strong U S  branded performance was partially offset by declines in private label products  as well as soft Canada sales performance  Overall  our U S  shipments were aligned with strong consumer consumption across our portfolio  Our category management initiatives  effective marketing support and merchandising execution  expanded distribution and new products all contributed to driving growth in the fourth quarter  Our IRI data indicates U S  McCormick branded spices and seasoning scanner sales grew in line with the category  and we again had double digit growth in unmeasured channels  And our McCormick branded dry recipe mixes continued their momentum of consumption and share growth  Consumption in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes accelerated through the fourth quarter both for the categories and McCormick branded products  with particularly strong results in November  Our brand marketing and our strong merchandising execution drove strong holiday results  Our new products  including ONE DISH and Street Taco dry recipe mixes  continued to gain momentum and contribute to growth  As we accelerate our condiment leadership  French s mustard and Stubb s barbecue continued to grow consumption and share  Frank s hot sauce had strong performance again this quarter  And over the entire Frank s portfolio  including frozen wings  seasoning blends and dry recipe mixes  we drove double digit consumption growth as we are making further progress in our opportunities to expand this brand  Now in the EMEA region  we re focused on driving brand growth and our success with new products and strong promotional programs has continued  particularly in the U K  Growth was tempered in other parts of the region for the quarter and the full year by declines in private label  We remain selective where we participate  aligning our strategy to optimize the profitability of our portfolio  In the Asia Pacific region  our sales growth was driven by pricing actions with volume growth  as I have mentioned  partially impacted by macroeconomic pressures in China  Our fundamentals across the region are strong and we ve driven strong growth for the full year in 2019  Let me take a moment now to mention the rapidly evolving events in China  which we are following very closely to  first and foremost  ensure the health and safety of our employees  All of our Wuhan facility activity  from sourcing of materials to distribution of manufactured products  is contained within the Chinese market  And at this point  it is too soon to quantify any business impact  Turning now to the flavor solutions segment  We grew sales 3  in constant currency in the fourth quarter  with all three regions benefiting from higher volume  In the Americas  we had strong flavor sales growth driven by snack seasonings attributable to robust base business growth and new products  Across both our restaurant and packaged food customers  new products continue to drive growth in the second half of the year following a particularly strong first half of innovation  Our momentum also continued with strong branded foodservice growth  Now turning to EMEA  We drove strong constant currency sales growth  We re winning with our customers through expanded distribution  promotional activities and new product  In fact  during 2019  we were successful in this region in establishing a significant new product platform with a global customer and have achieved a 100  new product win rate with them  And finally  in the Asia Pacific region  our fourth quarter sales growth was the best performance of the year and was partially driven by our customers  promotional activities  as well as new products  Moving from our fourth quarter results  I m pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments  which not only highlight what we achieved during 2019  but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2020  Now starting with our 2019 financial results as seen on Slide 9  We drove 3  constant currency sales growth  driven by new products  brand marketing investments and expanded distribution  Our consumer segment grew sales 3  in constant currency  driven by the U S  and China  In our flavor solutions segment  all three regions drove the constant currency sales growth of 3  with particularly strong EMEA performance  We grew constant currency adjusted operating income 7   driven by higher sales and a 60 basis point gross margin expansion  driven primarily from CCI led savings  This increase  combined with the lower interest expense and an increase in income from unconsolidated operations  drove an 8  increase in adjusted earnings per share to  5 35 for fiscal 2019  including an unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates versus last year  With higher sales and CCI  we increased our adjusted operating margin to 18 3   which is an 80 basis point expansion from last year  We expanded adjusted operating margin in both of our segments while also making investments to drive continued growth  We reached a record  119 million of annual cost savings driven by our CCI program to fuel our growth  We realized  463 million in CCI led cost savings over the last four years  exceeding our four year  400 million goal  And there continues to be a long runway in 2020 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings  2019 was an eighth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations  ending the year at  947 million  a 15  increase from last year  We are making great progress with our working capital improvements and expect the programs we ve put in place will continue the momentum in 2020  Our strong cash flow is enabling us to make great progress in paying down our acquisition debt  and we further reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio  as Mike will discuss further in a few minutes  At year end  our board of directors announced a 9  increase in the quarterly dividend  marking our 34th consecutive year of dividend increases  We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat  Now I would like to comment on some of our 2019 achievements beyond our financial performance  New products remain integral to our sales growth with 8  of 2019 sales from product launches in the last three years  In our consumer segment  where new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with our consumer  our robust 2019 launches across all regions accelerated our new product growth rate and we re excited about the momentum they are building  In our flavor solutions segment  we re capitalizing on our differentiated culinary foundation  customer collaboration and technology platform  We realized particularly strong new product sales growth in 2019 with packaged food companies  while new product growth with quick service restaurants was tempered due to a stronger core item focus particularly in the APZ region  which we mentioned throughout the year  Brand marketing is a key driver of sales growth  and we ve made significant investments supporting our brands over the last few years  In 2019  we continued to optimize our brand marketing spend  leveraging our scale and getting more value out of each marketing dollar  enabling us to maintain a comparable level of spend to last year while delivering an 11  increase in the Americas working media  Our marketing excellence organization drove greater speed  quality and effectiveness across our programs  notably in our digital marketing  In 2019  our digital leadership was recognized again by Gartner L2 Research  McCormick is ranked No  1 on their Digital IQ Index for food and the only food brand to earn the title of Genius  their top distinction  This marked our sixth consecutive year in the top five ranking of over 100 food and beverage brands on the effectiveness of our digital  website  social media  e commerce and mobile platforms  Our investments and resources across e commerce are also paying off  We re delivering global growth and have positioned ourselves for future acceleration  We drove double digit sales growth in all regions  resulting in global e commerce growth of 44   driven by both strong pure play and omni channel performance  We re making measurable progress toward our 2025 sustainability goals  and just last week  issued our most recent Purpose led Performance report  We re being recognized for our efforts  During 2019  we were recognized for the third consecutive year as a DiversityInc top 50 company  And at the recent 2020 Davos World Economic Forum  Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2020 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as No  1 in the food products industry for the fourth consecutive year  Just last week as well  we announced the election of Anne Bramman to our board of directors  Anne is currently the CFO of Nordstrom with extensive financial and leadership experience and brings an exciting new background to the board in digital  e commerce and online retail shopping  Anne s history of driving growth and productivity for companies with leading brands  as well as her broad financial expertise makes her a great fit for McCormick  We look forward to Anne further strengthening the impressive group of leaders that comprise our board  Mike will go over our 2020 guidance in a few moments  but I d like to mention a few highlights related to our growth momentum and plan  a significant business transformation plan and provide some summary comments on Slide 11  At the foundation of our sales growth rate is the rising global consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating  Consumers have an increased interest in creating flavor experiences with bold  rich  authentic flavors while also demanding convenience  Additionally  consumers are focused on fresh  natural and recognizable ingredients with greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food  and consumers want to know about the environmental and social impacts behind the brands they buy  Flavor continues to be an advantaged global category  and our products inspire flavor exploration and are the essential complement to real  fresh food  We deliver flavor across all markets and through all channels and are aligned with consumers  demand for flavor  convenience  health and sustainably minded business practices  Our alignment with these long term trends  our breadth and reach  combined with our execution of effective strategies positions us well to meet increased consumer demand  both through our product and through our customers  products and bolsters our confidence to drive sales growth across both segments  Across our consumer segment  our 2020 plans include  To further drive our undisputed leadership in spices and seasonings  accelerate our condiment global platform and fuel our growth in emerging markets and channels  as well as an on trend  fast growing platform  With our investments in brand marketing  category management  analytical capabilities and new products  as well as our drive to strengthen our connection with the consumer  we expect to drive further sales growth  For our flavor solutions segment  the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value added categories will continue in 2020  With top line opportunities gained from our global investments to expand our flavor scale  as well as further momentum in flavor categories  such as savory products and beverages and in branded food service  we expect to realize further results from this strategy  Driven by our best in class customer engagement  we also expect to continue our new product momentum  Beyond our strategies to drive sales growth  we re also making business transformation investments to create capacity for continued growth  Turning now to Slide 12  We are implementing a global operating model across our entire organization to deliver globally aligned and simplified processes that will allow us to grow at scale through increased digitalization and automation  As technology is the backbone for this model  we ve begun the process of replacing our existing disparate ERP systems with SAP HANA  a single global system  Our last ERP implementation was in the early 2000s  and since then  we have more than doubled in size  This growth  as well as changes in technology and SAP s plan to discontinue support of the current platform  requires us to invest once again to modernize our ERP systems and transform our business processes  We want to be ahead of the curve in achieving an advanced  integrated platform which will allow us to realize the benefits of a scalable platform for growth sooner and enable growth in line with our aspirations  This is a multiyear program  during which we will continually learn and adjust as we progress to a full global implementation  We have recently completed milestones for our global template and have made updates to our implementation plan which we expect will drive greater benefits and lower risk at a higher estimated total program cost  With the completion of these milestones  we ve broadened our program cost estimate to include estimates related to the go live activities in our operations which we are now able to estimate  As such  we have added these expenses to our information system technology cost  the basis for our previously communicated range of  150 million to  200 million  We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between  300 million and  350 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2022  with an estimated split of 40  capital spending and 60  operating expense  As such  the total operating expense impact for the entire program is estimated to be between  180 million and  210 million  In fiscal 2020  we are projecting our total operating expense impact to be approximately  80 million  which is an incremental  60 million over fiscal 2019  Notwithstanding the significant incremental investment in 2020  we expect growth in our underlying business to remain strong  And while the deployment activities will continue through 2022  we expect to return to our normal growth algorithm in 2021  Mike will discuss the 2020 financial impact of the program further in his outlook remarks  I d like to now share highlights of the updated plan  We ve now included in our program cost  as I just mentioned  projected expenses related to go live activities  such as inventory build and pre go live operating expenses  The inclusion of these costs drives nearly half of the increase in our operating expense projection  We re also extending our deployment schedule and increasing training and support  all to further mitigate risk  This strengthens our change management plan and represents the second biggest driver of our projected increase  Next  we plan to drive greater business transformation  including integrating certain other software applications within our global HANA solution  Finally  we ve also identified additional opportunities to drive greater financial benefits after stabilization of each of our phased deployments  These updates will drive greater benefits and lower risk  We are excited about this investment to enable us to transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform  Throughout 2020  we will periodically provide high level updates on the progress of the program  Our overarching focus though will be to continue highlighting the strength of our operating performance  Our achievements in 2019  our effective growth strategies  as well as our robust operating momentum all bolster our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2020  We re looking forward to sharing more details regarding our 2020 growth plans and our business transformation initiatives in just a few weeks at CAGNY  To summarize on Slide 13 before turning it over to Mike  We achieved solid financial results in 2019  We re driving strong momentum in sales growth  We re continuing to drive sales growth balanced with our focus on lowering costs to expand margins and sustainably realize long term earnings growth  We have a solid foundation  and in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced  we re ensuring we remain agile  relevant  Audio gap  long term sustainable growth  Our fundamentals  momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever  Our experienced leaders and employees are executing on our strategies which are designed to build long term value for our shareholders  With our 2019 results  they have again proved to be effective and we re confident they will prove effective again in 2020  In 2020  we continue to differentiate our brands  build capabilities and make investments for growth that will continue to move McCormick forward  Our top tier  long term growth objectives remain unchanged  and in our 2020 outlook  reflect the small    strong underlying business performance and necessary significant investments in business transformation to achieve those long term objectives  Mike will discuss this more in a few moments  I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world and thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement  The collective power of our people drives our momentum and our success  With this power and our effective strategy  we are well positioned to achieve continued growth in 2020 while also driving transformation to fuel growth into the future  Thank you for your attention  And it is now my pleasure to turn it over to Mike for additional remarks on our 2019 financial results and the details on our 2020 guidance Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Lawrence  and good morning  everyone  I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results  as well as detail on our 2020 outlook  Starting on Slide 15  During the fourth quarter  we grew sales 2  in constant currency  driven by both our consumer and flavor solutions segments  The consumer segment grew sales 2  in constant currency  This growth was driven by the Americas and Asia Pacific regions  On Slide 16  consumer segment sales in the Americas rose 2  in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2018  This increase was driven by strong U S  branded growth  partially offset by declines in private label products and soft Canada sales performance  In EMEA  constant currency consumer sales were down 1  from a year ago  primarily due to declines in private label products  We grew consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region  3  in constant currency  driven by pricing and promotional activities  Sales growth in India was strong due to e commerce and holiday promotional activity  Turning to our flavor solutions segment in Slide 19  We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3   driven by continued strength in our EMEA region  In the Americas  flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 3   driven by new products and base business growth with continued momentum in snack seasonings and branded foodservice  In EMEA  we grew flavor solutions sales 5  in constant currency  Sales growth to quick service restaurants and packaged food companies was driven by new products  base business volume growth and pricing  In the Asia Pacific region  flavor solutions sales grew 2  in constant currency as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of our promotional activity  As seen on Slide 23  fourth quarter adjusted operating income  which excludes special charges  increased 3   or 4  in constant currency  versus the year ago period  Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment rose to  227 million  a 1  increase  which was the same in constant currency  In the flavor solutions segment  adjusted operating income rose 11  to  76 million  which in constant currency was a 12  increase  Growth in both segments was primarily driven by higher sales  CCI led cost savings and a one time 2019 global benefit plan alignment with some offset from incentive compensation  Incentive compensation was partially due to and offset by favorable results realized below operating income  such as interest expense and income from unconsolidated operations  In the consumer segment  a 7  increase in brand marketing versus the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted the consumer adjusted operating income growth  Flavor solutions growth was favorably impacted by product mix  For the fiscal year  the increase in adjusted operating income in constant currency was 7   and we expanded adjusted operating income margin 80 basis points with both segments contributing to the growth  In constant currency  the consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 7   while the flavor solutions segment grew adjusted operating income 5   As seen on Slide 24  gross profit margin expanded 120 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period  as we have planned  And for the full year  expanded 60 basis points  driven by CCI led cost savings  Our selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased by 80 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2018  Leverage from sales growth and CCI led cost savings were more than offset by increases in both planned brand marketing and additional incentive compensation expense  Turning to income taxes on Slide 25  Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 24 7  as compared to 19  in the year ago period  Our fourth quarter adjusted rate in the year ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items  principally a higher level of stock option exercises  For the full year  our adjusted tax rate was 19 5   which is comparable to 2018  Income from unconsolidated operations increased 7  in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 18  for the full year  with strong performance by our McCormick and Mexico joint venture driving both comparisons  For 2020  we expect a mid  to high single digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations  At the bottom line  as shown on Slide 27  fourth quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share was  1 61 as compared to  1 67 for the year ago period  The decline was mainly due to a higher adjusted income tax rate versus last year  with partial offsets from higher adjusted operating income and lower interest expense  And this comparison also includes an unfavorable impact of currency rates  On Slide 28  we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year end balance sheet  Our cash flow provided from operations ended the year at a record high of  947 million compared to  821 million in 2018  For the fiscal year  our cash conversion cycle was significantly better than the year ago period  down 22  or 12 days  as we executed against programs to achieve working capital reductions  We returned a portion of this cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and paid down debt  reducing our acquisition debt during the fiscal year by  436 million  Of our  1 5 billion in acquisition related term notes  we have now paid down  1 25 billion and when we finished the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3 4 times  Our capital expenditures were  174 million in 2019 and included initial spending related to the transition of our ERP platform  as well as growth and optimization projects across the globe  In 2020  we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2019 to support our investments to drive growth  including our ERP business transformation investment  As of year end   32 million remained of a  600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in March 2015  An additional  600 million share repurchase program was authorized by our board of directors in November 2019  We expect 2020 to be another year of strong cash flow  driven by profit and working capital initiatives  And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash  making investments to drive growth  returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt  Let s now move to our current financial outlook for 2020 on Slides  29 and 30  We are well positioned for another year of underlying solid performance with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio  effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization  As Lawrence mentioned  in 2020  we expect adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth to reflect strong underlying business performance  offset by significant incremental investment associated with a business transformation  our ERP replacement program and a higher projected effective tax rate  We also expect there to be a minimal impact of currency rates  At the top line  we expect to grow sales 2  to 4   This increase is expected to be entirely organic growth as no incremental impact from acquisitions as planned  and will be driven primarily by higher volume and product mix from new products  expanded distribution and brand marketing  as well as the impact of pricing  which in conjunction with cost savings  is expected to offset anticipated mid single digit inflationary pressures  Our 2020 gross profit margin is expected to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2019  in part driven by our CCI led cost savings  Our adjusted operating income growth rate  excluding the incremental business transformation impact  reflects expected strong underlying business performance driven by sales growth and is projected to be a 5  to 7  increase from  979 million  This includes our cost savings target of approximately  105 million and an expected mid single digit increase in brand marketing investments  which will be heavier in the first half of the year  As Lawrence mentioned earlier  we are projecting an incremental operating expense impact of  60 million versus 2019 related to our ERP replacement program  This impact lowers our adjusted operating growth rate by 600 basis points  resulting in our total expected adjusted operating income to be comparable to 2019  plus or minus 1   We expect the ERP expenses to be higher in the second half of the year  Our 2020 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22  based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography  as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts  the most significant of which occurred during the first quarter of 2020 related to a refinement to our entity structure  For the remaining quarters  we estimate a tax rate of 23   thus driving our full year outlook of 22   This outlook versus our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate is approximately a 300 basis point headwind to our 2020 adjusted earnings per share growth  Our change in projected 2020 adjusted earnings per share from 2019 is expected to be driven by strong underlying business performance growth of 7  to 9   the unfavorable tax headwind I just mentioned and an estimated unfavorable 700 basis point impact from our incremental ERP investment  Our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in 2020 is  5 20 to  5 30 compared to  5 35 of adjusted earnings per share in 2019  In summary  we are projecting strong underlying business performance in our 2020 outlook  offset by a significant incremental ERP investment associated with business transformation and a higher projected effective tax rate  Turning to Slide 31  I want to discuss our track record of achieving our constant currency long term financial objectives  As we have said  our long term sales growth objective is 4  to 6   with base business  new products and acquisitions each contributing a third  Additionally  our long term objective is to grow adjusted operating income 7  to 9   This  coupled with our approach to capital allocation  results in a long term adjusted earnings per share growth objective of 9  to 11   Given there is variability in our business from year to year  especially related to transformational events  we evaluate our performance against these objectives over several years  With that said  a review of our five year compounded annual growth rates  which includes our 2020 guidance  projects that our five year compounded annual sales and adjusted operating income growth rates are expected to exceed our long term objectives  Additionally  our adjusted earnings per share performance is also in line with our long term objective  On a final note  while we have a significant transformational investment in 2020  we expect to return to our normal growth algorithm in 2021  As Lawrence mentioned  our foundation is strong  our strategy is effective and we are generating results in line with our objectives  I d like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Mike  Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail  I d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 32  We delivered solid organic sales  adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share growth in 2019  We expanded adjusted operating profit margin and drove strong results in both segments  Our 2020 outlook reflects strong operating performance  driven by our solid foundation  continued strong momentum and the successful execution of proven growth strategies  Our underlying business is robust with offsetting impacts from an incremental business transformation expense and a significant tax headwind  We re confident that 2020 will be another successful year and we will continue to build long term value  Importantly  we are continuing to deliver differentiated results  while significantly investing for growth to build the McCormick of the future  We ll share more about these transformation investments at CAGNY in a few weeks  Now let s turn to your questions  Questions   Answers  OperatorThank you   Operator instructions  And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays  Please proceed with your questions Andrew Lazar    Barclays Capital    Analyst Good morning  everybody Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Andrew Andrew Lazar    Barclays Capital    Analyst Hi there  Just one quick one on ERP and then just one on private label  With ERP  I guess  on the operating expense piece  I think as you mentioned  the cost is now expected to be about  I think   195 million at the midpoint versus the  60 million to  80 million before  given the go live piece that you mentioned  So as we think ahead to fiscal  21  assume like there s likely still another incremental step up on operating expense  where previously maybe fiscal  20 was expected to be the bulk of the investment  So in your comment around getting back to the algorithm in  21  is it that a big chunk of one time expense from  20 goes away and then you ve got an incremental expense in  21  Or    I m trying to get a sense of what the offset is to that incremental cost in  21 Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Hey  Andrew  let me start  and then I ll also let Mike comment on that  So I d say that s a great question and a great thing to clarify  So it is still our expectation that 2020 is the peak in the ramp up of the expenses from business transformation and ERP  We don t get    we don t have a real roll off of those expenses in  21  they continue at a high expense level  And so that s    but the ramp up is done  and so we expect to be back to algorithm in 2021  really all in  And then those expenses start to ramp    those expenses ramp down in 2022  So that    I hope that s clarified  Mike  did I   Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  In 2020  we ll have expenses for the pilot  as we mentioned  And also  it s our heavy investment year  We really    2022 and 2023 is when we get the wind down and the benefits really kick in for us Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer In 2020  we have to build    we ve got to build the whole global template and stand it up  And when we go live in our pilots  we actually have to start depreciating and realize all the expense for that Andrew Lazar    Barclays Capital    Analyst Gotcha  And does the ERP    by the way  I don t think this is the case  But will an implementation of a plan  a program like this  impact sort of ability to integrate acquisitions at all  Or is that really a separate aspect Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer I think that s a separate aspect  Our priority  of course  is growth  And so if we had an attractive asset that we wanted to buy  we would adjust our ERP plans in order to accommodate it  So we ve had a    we ve been thoughtful about that internally  and we don t believe that it would interfere with our ability to do an acquisition of the right asset  whether it be a bolt on or a large one Andrew Lazar    Barclays Capital    Analyst Great  And then just quickly on private label  You talked about some of the weakness in private label in consumer Americas  And I guess I m just trying to get a little more perspective or color around that  whether it was a one off  like particular retailer thing  Was it McCormick losing private label share  Or overall private label slowing  I m trying to get a sense of just  is this something we think about as you move through into 2020  or somewhere more of a one off  Not that it s a bad thing for margins  of course  But   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Exactly  So well  that s actually part of the answer  So the private label was one of the factors  In Q4  that was down  When we talked about it in Q3  it was up  And I would just    I would think that s    this is just the kind of a normal ebb and flow of this business  Private label is not strong as it was a year ago  And you can see that through the consumption data and that s reflected in our performance as well  I think this is more of a    kind of a normal ebb and flow in that part of the business  We are selective about where we participate and so there are always a level of wins and losses  We want to participate in private label where it s a strategic value to us and also where it s    frankly  it s profitable  I think you can see that as you look at our fourth quarter in the Americas in particular  brand came in strong  private label was light  and that change in mix flows right through in the margin in  Inaudible  Andrew Lazar    Barclays Capital    Analyst Yeah  Great  Thanks very much  See you soon OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan  Please proceed with your question Ken Goldman    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hi  Good morning  And thank you Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Hi  Ken  Good morning Ken Goldman    J P  Morgan    Analyst Hi  I just wanted to ask  I know it s way too early to talk about the impact of coronavirus  but I wanted to make sure that maybe I had my facts straight on it  So can I ask a couple of questions on maybe exactly what the    what your setup is there  I think you have one plant in Wuhan  I don t think it s two  I think it s one  Is that correct Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer That s correct Ken Goldman    J P  Morgan    Analyst And I guess the follow up would be  is that plant operating today  And is there any way for us to sort of quantify how much that contributes to your sales or EBIT  And can the other plants maybe pick up some of the slack if that plant doesn t happen to be operating  I just wanted to kind of get some of the lay of the land there to how to think about that Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer So I ll say a few words about this  Of course  we re    our concern  first and foremost  is for the health and safety of our employees and around product safety  So I want to emphasize that a lot of our efforts and responses are directed to that  We don t disclose our China sales specifically  but we do talk about    as you know  anything that s over 10   we do have to spell out  And so while China is a large country for us  it s our largest after the U S   it s less than 10  of our sales and quite a bit less than 10  of our profitability  even though that is a profitable business  I think it s too early to really know what the impact is going to be on it  For the    we ve got three plants in China  one is in Shanghai  one in Guangzhou and one in Wuhan  Right now  all of them are closed  It s the Chinese New Year holiday  They closed in the normal course of business actually before all the government restrictions were put in place  So this was a very orderly  planful shutdown for their regular holiday season  Normally  there s about a 10 day shutdown period for the Chinese New Year  If everything was normal  they would have reopened for business on February 2  along with the rest of the country    sorry  February 3  I think  is the Monday  for resumption of shipments  And that s actually the date that the government has put out for most of the country to reopen operations  The city of Shanghai has put in a special restriction saying companies can t reopen till February 10  but other than that  there s really no new news for us  And so far  it s not a business interruption  I think it really remains to be seen how far this goes  Certainly  the reduction in people traveling  being able to go out to eat  being able to shop at the grocery stores  is not a positive for our business  We can t really quantify it right now  We certainly think that more facts will come out over the coming days  really  and we ll see    we ll have    we ll be better able to understand what the real business impact is Ken Goldman    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  That s very helpful  I guess  a quick follow up and then I ll let it go   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer If there s one thing I would say    if there s thing that gives us kind of caution around our first half of the year  it s this    is the uncertainty around this Ken Goldman    J P  Morgan    Analyst No  that s exactly where I was going to go  Is it safe to say that your guidance includes a little bit of conservatism just because of the uncertainty  Or is it really just so uncertain that it s not worth even estimating at all in your numbers Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer OK  I think it s for consideration  It s definitely something  in the last week or two  we ve thought hard about  And yeah  I d say so  The other point I d raise  too  This Wuhan manufacturing facility  we source from China and sell into China  There s really no external   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Very good point Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So it s really within country Ken Goldman    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  Thank you so much OperatorOur next question is from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS  Please proceed with your questions Steven Strycula    UBS   Analyst Hi  Good morning  So first question would be more of an operational one  Just wanted to know  Lawrence  relative to internal plan  what  if anything  kind of deviated in the fourth quarter trend  It sounds like  at a high level  it might have been private label  And just to clarify a little bit more from Andrew Lazar s question is  is there any kind of read forward into 2020 about that state of the business  Or was there really just some lumpiness between Q3 and Q4 Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Well  first of all  at the end of the    on our Q3 call  we did got to the low end of our range for a variety of reasons  I talked about some unseasonable weather impact and a warehouse transition in our flavor solutions side on the Americas part  And those factors did spill into Q4  really  in the September time frame in particular  So we did come in a little light due to those factors rolling forward  especially in September  and some softness in private label in Canada that we mentioned in our prepared remarks  And I would think that the Canada softness is nonrecurring related to the promotional activity that we didn t repeat  and we see that as a nonrecurring factor  The private label  probably I would expect that to carry into the early part of the year as well  So that might be the one carryforward item  So those were some of the negatives  I will say on the positive side  the quarter started a little soft  as I had mentioned  We had unseasonable weather in September  In the Americas  we did have some hangover from the warehouse transition  But it got stronger as we went through the quarter and definitely finished on the strong side  We got strong consumer consumption and strong branded growth  which as I mentioned on the    in Andrew s question  you can see in our margins  The flavor solutions is really solid other than the warehouse issue early in the quarter  So I wouldn t think there s anything untoward there and really no reason to    I don t really think of anything as being a negative there that would carry forward Steven Strycula    UBS   Analyst OK  that s very helpful  And then a quick follow up for Mike  I know it s extremely early to even think about 2021  I just want to understand the cadence you did    laid out for the ERP system  So for 2021  would that imply that the residual leftover balance would be    that runs through the P L is roughly  80 million to  115 million  And then the tax rate this year is 22   including discrete items  Is the normalized rate  given what we know about tax reform at this point  probably 24  for the company  How should we think about it Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I think if you look at the fourth quarter tax rate  which was 24 7   it s going to be in that range  We didn t    hardly had any discrete items in the fourth quarter  So yeah  the underlying tax rate is in that range  Of course  we re always looking to optimize structure and things like that to help drive that  From the ERP perspective  like we said  I mean  there s a lot of cost going into  20 and  21   21 is when we really have the big deployments  So we have the pilot this year  and we re building up the global model in 2020  Then I think of it    those are the big years  We ll have some expenses out into  22 and  23 as we bring up some of the other regions  but they will fall off pretty rapidly Steven Strycula    UBS   Analyst OK  And is any of the  80 million this year included in the  0 05 charge that you re adjusting out of operating earnings Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Special charges  No  no  no  None of this program is going through special charges  This is all just going    falling right through the P L  normal GAAP Steven Strycula    UBS   Analyst Very helpful  Thank you Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Thanks OperatorThe next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with AllianceBernstein  Please proceed with your questions Alexia Howard    AllianceBernstein    Analyst Good morning  everyone Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Hi  Alexia Alexia Howard    AllianceBernstein    Analyst So I ve just got two quick ones  The operating income trends between consumer and flavor solutions  it was up very modestly this quarter in consumer  but up double digits in the flavor solutions side  Just wondering  will the brand marketing investment continue to pressure margins in the consumer side  And can the margins in the food    flavor solutions side of things continue to expand like this so that they continue to converge over time  And then I have a follow up  Thank you Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Alexia  this is Mike  We saw in the second half of the year  our flavor solutions margins did improve  We had a tough comparison in the first half because of transactional FX rates  Those did ease in the second half  like we talked about earlier in the year  So we do see those favorable trends continue  FX is really    for 2020  is going to be a neutral impact versus negative 2 ish percent in 2019  So that s a favorable trend there  And we do see continued optimization of our portfolio  more value added products in flavor solutions to help drive margins upward  On the consumer side  I mean this year  we kind of took    in 2018  our advertising increased about 18   So in 2019  we basically have spent comparable  We ve decided we re going to optimize our spend  formed a marketing excellence program  And even though our A P spending was flat  our working media was up double digits  So we really got the optimization there Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer And we also changed    we ve skewed it  So if you recall  in the first half  we were below a year ago  in the second half  we were above  And that s what you re seeing in the fourth quarter operating income coming through  is that kind of    I won t say hoarded it  but we ve skewed the A P toward the fourth quarter where it  frankly  has the highest ROI Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer And you ll see in the next year  as we said in the prepared remarks  we re going to up spend A P  The comparison is easier in the first half of the year  we ll have increases in A P  a little above our total year guidance  So we get a very favorable return on it  We measure this  It s really effective Alexia Howard    AllianceBernstein    Analyst Great  And as a follow up  acquisitions  I think in previous commentary  you d said you were looking internationally and possibly at the flavor solutions side of things  Has that thinking changed as you think about the larger scale deals that might be on your radar screen  Thank you  And I ll pass it on Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer I d say that there hasn t been any    there s no change in our thinking about acquisitions  If we were to do a bolt on sized acquisition that contributed to our international business to kind of balance out the skew that we ve got toward the Americas right now  that would be a plus  Flavor solutions  we re certainly interested in assets in that flavor space  And there s    so those    that s    those are certainly areas where we would be looking to fish  And the same set of the larger assets that we have on our internal tracker  we re still out there in the market  There have been some large transactions in the space and they were not things that we were targeting Alexia Howard    AllianceBernstein    Analyst Great  Thank you very much  I ll pass it on OperatorOur next question is from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your questions Faiza Alwy    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Hi  Good morning Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Faiza Faiza Alwy    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Morning  So two questions for me  One is just on    is it possible for you to disaggregate  as you think about 2020 outlook  between the flavors business versus the consumer business  Are you expecting more growth in one segment versus the other Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We expect the guidance for both of them in the 2  to 4  range  which is pretty consistent with our strategy for the time  We feel there s opportunities  Inaudible  Faiza Alwy    Deutsche Bank    Analyst OK  And then just wanted to talk about cash flow a little bit  especially as it relates to the deployment of ERP  and what that would mean for the cash conversion cycle in 2020 and beyond  And then relatedly  if you could discuss your capital allocation priorities because you have delevered quite a bit  You re getting closer to your three times target  But then you ve talked about a new share repurchase program and you just talked about acquisitions  So how should we think about sort of your priorities for cash in 2020 Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Those are great question  On cash conversion cycle  yeah  we ve    we re down 44 days since 2016  So we really put a lot of effort into our program across all components of working capital  We do see there s a lot of runway to go here with extending terms in other programs  We do  however  also realize that some time this year  we re going to start building inventory  which will eat into some of those gains  But I think the opportunities overall still do outweigh some of that inventory build  I don t want to give a cash conversion cycle forecast  I don t want to get into that much detail  but we still do think there s some opportunities  And the nice thing is once we get these go lives behind us  we do think there s a lot of benefits from a working capital perspective from being on one global system  So that s part of the return that we re expecting from our ERP investment  quite frankly  From a capital allocation perspective  you re right  we re down to 3 4 times debt to EBITDA  We re going to continue paying down debt this year in the absence of M A targets as we promised  We did    we authorized a  600 million of buyback  We were down to  32 million  What we re using that  as stock options get exercised  we re neutralizing the impact there  So we    in the near term  we ll continue to do that  We don t see any large stock purchase or anything like that  M A is obviously where we    paying down debt and attractive M A targets to drive growth are our two best uses of cash Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer And we ve looked at some targets  So we re actively considering assets that has    that come available  We don t want to    we feel that we re    we have clear line of sight to getting down to our target  We don t think that we actually have to literally get there  So we re not going to let a great asset get away Faiza Alwy    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Great  Thank you OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your questions Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    Analyst Hi  thank you  I might have missed it  but the reason for the increase in the cost of the ERP system was to have a broader estimate  I guess  for the go live activity  But I think you did have an estimate before for the go live activity  So what changed between now and a few months ago to have it expand that much Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer The estimate that we gave previously were literally the program costs around the IT or program itself  and did not    they did not include the broader business impact and preparation of the business  which we re now giving quantification of and guiding to and really building    all of the costs associated with building and holding inventory and business preparation  it s about 50  of the increase in the opex component that we re talking about here  And our concern here is really to make sure that we have a smooth go live without any disruption to our customers and to mitigate risk around these go lives  It would be our hope that they go smoothly  And we ve got a lot of experience in go live with SAP  so we re not neophytes to this  We did just go    brought up the all of the RB Foods business on our old version of SAP very smoothly  and we would hope that this goes smoothly  But we don t want to just hope  We want to make sure that we re really doing the things that it takes to mitigate that risk  That s a portion of it  And then also  we haven t given any kind of window into some of the other expenses  as we have the software as a service and    that we start to realize and the depreciation cost  which I m probably better off letting Mike talk about  So I m going to stop on that point right now  let you take over on that  But    and then the second piece is just    is also  again  around mitigating risk  is strengthening the change management program  So we ve taken that a lot deeper as we ve looked at this  We just have really been thoughtful about identifying areas where there might be    a business might be at risk or if something doesn t go right  or where    we re not taking for granted  people working in the plants  looking at new screens are going to get it quickly  So we ve really doubled down on the change management program  the number of super users that are embedded in the business  And we ve extended the deployment schedule just a little bit following the pilots to make sure that we ve got time to adjust if we  if anything  does surprise us in the pilots  Which again  we don t have any reason to believe it will  but we re trying to be thoughtful and mitigate the risk as much as we can  Mike  do you want to   Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer No  I think   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Go ahead  Rob  Go ahead Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    Analyst I guess    OK  I guess  if you ve given us a conservative estimate here  it s now in the organic kind of EBIT growth algorithm  So if there is improvement versus that cost  will you kind of give us an update and tell us to the extent to which it s kind of upside to your    to any given year Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Obviously  we will  Rob  But we realize this is a multiyear program  though  But we will definitely be very transparent with this Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer I ll just say  these programs are expensive  They are multiyear  they are major  broad  enterprisewide programs  And it s a lot of money  but we believe the price tag s in line with the experience that others have had when you consider the all in cost Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    Analyst Right  OK  Thank you OperatorOur next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your questions Adam Samuelson    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Yeah  thanks  Good morning  everyone  I was hoping to just get a little bit more color on the inflation guidance that you ve given for the mid single digits and the ability on part to offset that with pricing  Just  a  where  just  categories of buy where you re seeing kind of inflation at or above those kinds of levels  like what s really driving it  And second  on the pricing side  I mean  would seem to imply about 100 basis points of pricing in the revenue growth guidance  And just any specific categories or geographies where that might be an outsized benefit Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Adam  this is Mike  From a cost perspective  we re seeing a pretty broad based increase across a lot of items  I mean  some are declining  some like garlic are going up  but pretty much every category is seeing inflation higher than the last couple of years  whether it s packaging  the shipments from overseas or some new regulations there that are causing some increases  So I wouldn t pin it on one thing  But from a pricing perspective  we ve obviously built that into our plans Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  But I d say it s    I don t think we want to break out that pricing portion of the guidance separately  But the pricing we are planning  a  contributes to the confidence we have in our outlook for 2020  that s for sure  And I will say that when we do take pricing  we know there s some elasticity impact as well  so we re considering that as well  But just because we re taking pricing doesn t mean it s literally additive to the results that we realize in the absence of pricing  You have to consider pricing and volume together  I ll also add that we ve got    there s always some commercial tension in the discussions about pricing  So I don t want to get overly specific about where we are  I can say that in the Americas  we ve really completed our pricing negotiations and have that resolved  and those pricing changes are going into effect as scheduled  In other parts of the world  that varies somewhat by market because    sometimes because of statutory reasons  But we d expect to have it all in place by the end of the first half Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer So you ll see a ramp up in pricing most likely during the year Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Our results Adam Samuelson    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  That s helpful color  And then just quickly for me  a follow up  If we would go back 12 months last year  in November  you had a challenging Thanksgiving in the U S  And just want to make sure that as we look at kind of the sales performance this quarter in the Americas  there was    that returned back to normal  And mix was    seems to be favorable  given the private label decline  but as it relates to some of the premium Thanksgiving ingredients that you sell  that all    that there was nothing   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  we had a recovery of that business  Inaudible   Our spices and seasonings business shipped    as I mentioned  consumption was strong  We shipped well ahead of consumption as we lapped that dip on those branded items  And that s definitely a contributor to the strong gross margin in the quarter  That s really where you see that through  And there s an offset  so it s less visible on the top line  as we said  that soft    I would say the lower private label sales and some softness in Canada Adam Samuelson    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  I appreciate the color  I ll pass it on  Thanks OperatorOur next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel  Please proceed with your question Chris Growe    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Hi  good morning Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Hi  Chris Chris Growe    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Hi  I just wanted to kind of follow on the last question  a point you made  just to be clear on the private label side  Is that    so you talked about weakness in the category  or have you lost some private label business  perhaps even intentionally  Just to understand the magnitude of the decline in the fourth quarter  It seems like it was larger than I expected  Is that because of just the category  Or   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Well  certainly  the category trends on private label are nowhere near what they were a year ago or two years ago  So you ve seen that flatten out  But really  it s just    I don t want to overbake it here  We had a    third quarter private label was unusually strong  It was a little soft in the fourth quarter  And I d say that this is just kind of normal ebb and flow in that business Chris Growe    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst OK  And just a second question  if I could  around    and you talked about it before  You have some cost inflation built in for the year  mid single digits  You ve got some pricing you ve noted  and we don t really get into the timing and the amount of that  I guess what I m trying to understand is  when I add in the cost savings  I guess I ll call them CCI cost savings   105 million  Why is that not sufficient then to offset the ERP spending  Is it because it has to offset some inflation  Or were those savings getting kind of eaten up to where they can t offset this incremental expense in ERP spending Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Chris  this is Mike  I mean  there s a  60 million incremental investment we re making this year that we wouldn t have in a normal year  so I wouldn t expect CCI to offset that  I mean  CCI  what it does is it drops through the P L  It covers things like increased advertising as we make more investments on things  increased SG A costs for salary  There s things that    and actually  if you look at our guidance for next year  we have about a 50 basis point adjusted operating profit increase  which is our long term algorithm  So I think the value is we can t expect  when you have a  60 million incremental item  to cover that  And frankly  we hit  119 million this year on CCI  we re guiding to  105 million  Some of these resources we use to drive CCI are really supporting the ERP program  So we just want to be aware of that  too  We can t just turn on CCI and make it go up  60 million Chris Growe    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst OK  Is the    I guess we ll call it CCI program  Is there a multiyear program behind this  Or is it just a year at a time from here on out as you think about your cost saving opportunity Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  when we did    four years ago  when we start    did the four year program  and that was kind of a different time in the food industry  and we wanted to really show how our    how we were different from a cost perspective and really planful and thoughtful about this and not doing ZBB and all that sort of stuff  At this point  it s a year by year process  but it has a    there s a long term plan to it Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer  Inaudible Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer There s a program  there s things like ERP  that will generate savings in  22   23 that are built into our internal    we have an internal program but we don t talk about that externally  We ll give you the yearly buckets as we get to guidance Chris Growe    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst OK  Got it  thank you OperatorOur next question is from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America  Please proceed with your questions Peter Galbo    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hey  good morning  Lawrence and Mike  And thanks for taking the question  Just two really quick cleanup ones for me  Mike  I know you had said capex for 2020 to be up over  19  I don t know if there s any way just to quantify that more  And then any    go ahead Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  in the 10 K  it s  265 million  That s a round number Peter Galbo    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst  265 million  OK  got it  And then anything you can do to help us out just with interest expense  I would expect it to be lower year over year Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  I think it will be lower  We have a nice decline this year  I think you model it based on our outstanding debt and continued cash conversion  I mean  you can    it will be down  definitely Peter Galbo    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Got it  Thanks OperatorOur final question is coming from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies  Please proceed with your questions Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    Analyst Great  Thank you very much  A couple of questions  I guess  just the first question  just to clarify on the transformation expenses over the next three years  It sounds like what you re saying is  yeah  there s the ramp this fiscal year  And then just based off the math  it s probably like a similar expense in  21 and  22 as well  if we just cut it in half  what s remaining  But that might ramp down a little bit as we go through time  and then it s the benefits that offset  Because I guess where I just    where there s a little confusion on my end was  if we have the numbers and we know what you re saying for this fiscal year  then why wouldn t we just take the remaining and just divide it by the next two fiscal years and say  oh  it s just kind of a standardized  60 million run rate per year  It sounds like what you re saying is  oh  no  There are going to be all these benefits to offset that kind of run rate cost Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I think we ll start getting benefits in 2022  So you got to compartmentalize 2020 and 2021  It s a significant investment  increased expenses  around the same level of impact on the P L between 2020 and 2021  And then 2022  there s lesser go lives and then the benefits kick in  so you get a nice tailwind in 2022 and 2023  right Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer So it s just like a  60 million run rate  That s    I don t    I m not sure I m following you on that one  Rob  I mean   Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    Analyst Sorry  it was just    I just took the midpoint of the  300 million to  350 million  which is  325 million  and   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer It s not an ongoing cost  right Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    Analyst Right  OK Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer It s like the proverbial pig in the python Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    Analyst Yeah  OK  Fair  completely fair  And then the other question I had was just on private label profitability  Yeah  I think you said there was    just given a little bit of a mix shift  branded private label  in the quarter maybe early this year  But some of that is    can be margin mix positive  But I swear I ve heard you say  historically  at times  it might depend on what private label that is because a lot of your private label  it seems like overall is usually margin mix neutral  it s more of a penny profit piece  So just any clarification as to basically  like  on average  is private label usually a little bit lower margin for you or not Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer I mean  I think overall  I mean  you got to understand  with private label  we re pretty much focusing on large customers where we get the plant optimization  manufacturing optimizations and distribution optimization  And it s because we do this whole service for the customer  And from a total margin perspective  the other thing compared to brand  you don t have things like innovation  marketing  things like that below there  It s still not    we d much rather sell brand  I mean  that is   Lawrence Kurzius    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer And from a gross margin standpoint  there s no doubt that private label is lower  I don t want there to be any misunderstanding about that  Was there like a return on investment  it s surprisingly close to brand because of these other expenses and it utilizes existing capacities and so on  But it is    but private label certainly is lower gross margin Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    Analyst OK  Makes complete sense  And then just lastly  in terms of the 2  to 4  on the top line  I know you said you don t really want to break out pricing relative to volumes  but in the prepared    or in the press release  sort of you do say that you still expect to grow sales via increased distribution and brand marketing  etc  So I mean  just to be clear  you do expect volumes overall to still be up  It s kind of basic  but that s it Mike Smith    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer We re nodding our heads  but you can t see  But yeah  we certainly do  I mean  we ve got a lot of reasons to believe in our growth plans for 2020  Certainly  there s    pricing is an element of it  But we have confidence that we re going to be able to continue to drive our undisputed leadership in spices and seasonings  We see continued growth opportunities in condiment and in global flavor and particularly in those areas where we have    where we ve got scale  Notwithstanding the issue in China  which we hope is short term  we think that emerging markets and channels and platforms are our continued growth opportunity  And with all of our programs and especially with all of the digital  e commerce and social media outreach that we do  we re strengthening our consumer connection  So we feel    I mean  we have a lot of reasons to believe that our growth plans for 2020 are solid Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    Analyst OK  Super  Thank you OperatorThank you  I ll now turn the call over to Lawrence Kurzius for closing

121946,343461,MKC,Sterling to gain on hopes for UK EU trade deal by year end  Reuters poll,news,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON  Reuters    Sterling will be nearly 4  stronger in a year than it is now  according to a Reuters poll of market strategists  based on expectations that Britain will secure a trade deal with the European Union this year despite its tough initial stance 
On Monday sterling took a pummeling after Prime Minister Boris Johnson set tough terms for the trade talks  Some of the forecasts in the Reuters poll were gathered before Johnson s speech 
Britain left the EU on Friday and Johnson s comments on Monday have rekindled fears of a cliff edge   whereby no trade deal is agreed   at the end of an 11 month transition period which Johnson has repeatedly said he won t ask to extend 
Foreign exchange strategists in Reuters polls have repeatedly said that leaving without a deal  and so trading on World Trade Organisation rules only  would be rough for the economy and the worst outcome for the pound  
The currency ended January on a high note after the Bank of England surprised many by leaving borrowing costs on hold but fell as much as 1 7  to  1 2984 on Monday  It was trading around  1 30 on Tuesday after better than expected construction data 
Median forecasts in the Jan  31 Feb  4 poll of 65 strategists showed the pound would be up at  1 31 in a month   1 32 in six months and then  1 35 in a year s time 
That is still well below the  1 50 it was trading at before the June 2016 referendum  when Britons voted by 52  to 48  to leave the world s largest trading bloc 
With time short to agree even a bare bones deal  economists in a Reuters poll last month said there was a median 20  chance of a disorderly departure at the end of the transition period  during which existing agreements apply as if Britain were still an EU member 
BREXIT BOUNCE 
Johnson s emphatic December election victory stoked hopes for a Brexit bounce to the economy and the BoE said on Jan  30 a recent pick up in growth had weakened the case for it to lend more monetary support 
 A bounce in UK economic growth helped by a good sized fiscal stimulus in Q2 remains our base case   said James McCormick  NYSE MKC   global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets 
 We still like buying sterling and the BOE s decision to pass on a cut last week  which was a surprise to us  has given the sterling trend some renewed momentum  
In contrast to the BoE  the U S  Federal Reserve and European Central Bank eased policy last year 
But the coronavirus outbreak spreading further beyond China s borders has raised more global growth risks and is set to keep the U S  dollar  which has dominated most others in foreign exchange markets for around two years  firmly on its throne well into 2020   EUR POLL 
With the outlook for euro zone growth already lukewarm before the virus outbreak and no more policy changes expected from the ECB  little movement is expected between the pound and the common currency

121987,343502,MKC,Entrepreneur Andrew Yang s quixotic U S  presidential campaign gets serious,news,"By Joseph Ax
NEW YORK  Reuters    Entrepreneur Andrew Yang knows most people initially viewed his candidacy for U S  president   and his campaign promise to guarantee every American a basic  government funded income   as a gimmick 
 You all heard at some point there s an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone  1 000 a month   the 44 year old New York Democrat said to laughter and cheers inside a packed union hall this month in Las Vegas  Nevada 
Then he turned serious   We re in an era of economic change  and we need to think differently  
That way of thinking has propelled Yang  the Ivy League educated son of Taiwanese immigrants who would be the country s first Asian American president  from what many considered to be an entertaining diversion to a mainstream contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 
Now Yang s campaign  which began in 2017 but has seen its fortunes rise sharply in recent months  is rushing to catch up with rivals 
He stands near 3  in the latest public opinion polls  putting him in sixth place in the 19 candidate field ahead of numerous sitting lawmakers  His  10 million fundraising haul in the third quarter was the sixth most among Democrats and more than triple his total for the second quarter 
Most importantly  he continues to inspire a fervent following known as the Yang Gang  supporters who wear blue  MATH  hats   a tribute to Yang s devotion to data that has since become an acronym for  Make America Think Harder    and revel in his  nerdy  campaign 
When Yang promised to become the first president to use PowerPoint in a State of the Union address  the Las Vegas crowd chanted   PowerPoint  PowerPoint  
Yang s central message   that automation is destroying U S  jobs and that his  Freedom Dividend  is the best way to mitigate the damage   has particularly resonated with young  male Democrats  independents and some Republicans  according to Reuters Ipsos polls 
In that sense  Yang appears to be drawing many of the same types of voters U S  Senator Bernie Sanders did in his unexpectedly strong outsider run for the White House in 2016 
According to Reuters polling data  Sanders supporters are three times as likely to choose Yang as their second favorite than backers of either U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren or former Vice President Joe Biden  the other two leading contenders 
Las Vegas resident Kelsey McCormick  NYSE MKC   30  said she  fell in love  with Yang after hearing about his universal basic income proposal 
 It s refreshing for a politician to say he ll give people what they need without telling them how to use it   she said 
BUILDING A  YANG GANG  GROUND GAME
Buoyed by last quarter s cash infusion  Yang s team is aggressively hiring in the early voting states of Iowa  New Hampshire  Nevada and South Carolina  just in time for the crucial stretch ahead of the first nominating contests in February 
Yang s aides  while reluctant to share precise figures  said the campaign staff   currently in excess of 75   had tripled since Sept  1 and would triple again by Nov  1 
The hiring spree is aimed at translating Yang s online strength   including Yang Gang volunteers across the country   into on the ground operations such as neighborhood canvassing and phone banks 
Several Democratic officials in New Hampshire and Iowa said Yang s ground operations still lag well behind those of his main rivals  including Warren  Biden  Sanders and others  who were able to build up teams earlier in the year 
Last week  Yang staffers held a two day retreat in New York City  where they mapped out strategy and played appropriately nerdy bonding games  like presidential trivia 
The campaign  whose top aides early on were all political neophytes  has brought on more than a half dozen seasoned Democratic operatives since the summer 
One of those new hires is national organizing director Zach Fang  who oversaw field operations in several states for Sanders  2016 campaign and previously worked for Democratic U S  Representative Tim Ryan s presidential campaign this year 
Like many of Yang s supporters  Fang said he joined because Yang s focus on automation made sense to him after he spent time working in Silicon Valley  where he saw firsthand the way technology was threatening traditional work 
 There was no one else saying what Andrew was saying   Fang said   I didn t realize how many other  me s  there were out there in the world  
During the Las Vegas town hall  Yang dismissed the various theories propagated by cable television pundits as reasons for Trump s victory in 2016  racism  Russia  Hillary Clinton 
 The real catalyst and the numbers   I m a numbers guy   is that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan  Ohio  Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  Iowa   he said   And if that list of states sounds familiar  those are the states that Donald Trump needed to win  and did win  
Yang said Nevada  which relies heavily on its hospitality industry  will lose more jobs to automation than any other state  noting that MGM Resorts International has announced plans to replace bartenders with robots at its casinos 
 We re in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country  what experts are calling the fourth industrial revolution   he said   When is the last time you heard a politician say the words  fourth industrial revolution   ",2019-10-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/entrepreneur-andrew-yangs-quixotic-us-presidential-campaign-gets-serious-1995542,1995542
121988,343503,MKC, No Champagne Yet  as Investors  Analysts Greet Brexit Deal With Caution ,news," Bloomberg     For a while there  investors and analysts got a taste of what s in store if they ever escape the long shadow of Brexit  Unfortunately  most of them think freedom is still a long way off 
Assets across Europe briefly surged on Thursday as markets embraced the news that a Brexit deal had been struck in Brussels  But as traders assessed the obstacles ahead  the giddy mood faded  The deal    struck just in time to present to EU leaders as they gather in Belgium s capital    still needs the approval of the British Parliament  Northern Ireland s DUP  whose votes may be key  have said they will not back the accord 
 It might not be time to pop open the champagne quite yet   said Jim McCormick  NYSE MKC   the global head of strategy at NatWest Markets   But even if it is voted down by U K  parliament the Tories will have a stronger hand heading into a general election  The dynamic clearly changed  
Here are some early reactions from investors and strategists across Europe 
Petr Krpata  chief currency strategist  ING Bank 
 The deal announced but the key hurdle of the deal being voted into the U K  Parliament remains  With the DUP not changing its position  it is questionable whether the deal will get through the Parliament  There is now risk the current deal will have the same fate of Theresa May s   The potential for sterling to rally is  watered down by the DUP comments and the subsequent uncertainty about the outcome of the Parliamentary vote  Nick Wall  portfolio manager  Merian Global Investors 
 The worst case scenario seems to be off the table in this Parliament and probably in the next if Johnson gets a majority  A near term deal approved by parliament would probably help risk assets the most  but a setback should be short lived  Seema Shah  chief strategist  Principal Global Investors 
 Investors should not be too enthusiastic as the endless negotiations and uncertainty over the past three years will take its toll on the country  Even with a Brexit agreement  the country will suffer a lot of economic pain as a result of the exit from the bloc  Uwe Maderer  head of fixed income  LBBW Asset Management
 Brexit cliff edge seems to be over and that changes the market dynamics a bit  although the Parliamentary vote is still pending  The political will has clearly changed towards achieving a deal   The deal as it is all about goods and not services and only a low level of alignment with EU standards  That is clearly negative for longer term growth in the U K  but surely better than no deal and a WTO based relationship with the EU  Lars Kreckel  global equity strategist  Legal   General Investment Management 
 It s impossible to trade the twists and turns of the news flow  Generally  the stronger pound is bad for FTSE 100 versus other markets  but some of that should be offset by international flows returning to U K  equities  Jim McCormick at NatWest again 
 What is different is that no one sees kicking the can down the road as an option any more  So old red lines are less red  I ve been bearish on German fixed income and this is certainly supportive  You may be seeing start of dollar turn as well  European political risks have been a dollar boost  Jane Foley  head of currency strategy  Rabobank 
 We have to remember that PM May had a deal too  Andreas Meyer  portfolio manager  Aramea Asset Management 
 An important political obstacle seems to be resolved that paralyzed the market  However I do see essential residual risks  whether Johnson is able to push the deal through at home  That means more surprises might be ahead  Further cooperation with the EU  and not a hard deal  increases the likelihood that regulatory requirements for banks and insurance companies will be taken over by U K  institutions and the stability of issuers will be maintained  I like to invest in HSBC  Lloyds  LON LLOY   RBS  LON RBS    Barclays   LON BARC  and now the bold Brexit stamp  which influenced them  is significantly weaker  Ricardo Gil  head of asset allocation  Trea Asset Management in Madrid 
 The deal is positive as it removes uncertainty that was weighing on the market  although most of the optimism may have already been priced in  I don t expect to increase our exposure to equity following the deal  but we will go longer on banks  Artur Baluszynski  head of research  Henderson Rowe 
 Big win for Boris  If he manages to get it through parliament  we should see a wave of risk on trades coming into U K  market  Michael Hewson  chief market analyst  CMC Markets

121989,343504,MKC, Failure   Mexico admits bungled arrest of kingpin s son after mayhem,news,"By Dave Graham and Lizbeth Diaz MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexican officials on Friday admitted they had bungled the arrest of kingpin Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman s son  who they let go during shootouts with drug gangs in the streets of a major city  but the president insisted his security strategy was working  Cartel gunmen surrounded around 35 police and national guards in the northwestern city of Culiacan on Thursday and made them free Ovidio Guzman  one of the jailed drug lord s dozen or so children  after his brief detention set off widespread gun battles and a jailbreak that stunned the country  The chaos in Culiacan  a bastion of Guzman s Sinaloa Cartel  turned up pressure on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  who took office in December promising to pacify a country weary of more than a decade of gang violence and murders  Lopez Obrador came under heavy criticism on social media and from security experts  who said that authorities risked encouraging copycat actions by caving in to the gang  and that the retreat from a major city created the impression that the cartel  not the state  was in control  His own officials said the operation in Culiacan  the capital of Sinaloa state and home to nearly a million people  had not been planned as well as it should have been   It was done hastily  the consequences were not considered  the riskiest part wasn t taken into account   Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told a news conference in Culiacan  alongside Security Minister Alfonso Durazo  who called the attempt to capture the younger Guzman a  failure   Durazo admitted he and the military top brass were not aware ahead of time of the mission to bring into custody the alleged trafficker  calling it a bureaucratic error  But the president defended the government response   Capturing a criminal can t be worth more than people s lives   he said  adding that officials  did well  to free Ovidio Guzman   We don t want dead people  we don t want war   said Lopez Obrador  a veteran leftist who has advocated a less confrontational approach to tackling the gangs   We re doing really well in our strategy   he said  The violent reaction to Guzman s apprehension in a wealthy area of Culiacan was on a scale rarely seen during Mexico s long drug wars  Sandoval said he had reports of at least eight people killed  including five suspected gang members  in Culiacan  where schools were closed on Friday after the ordeal  WHO S IN CONTROL  One Facebook  NASDAQ FB  user stumbled on two dead bodies in the street near an abandoned truck  suggesting the death toll may yet rise in the city  where the government said gunmen staged 14 attacks on the armed forces and 19 road blocks where vehicles burned  Footage of Thursday s chaos on social media showed panicked residents fleeing and high caliber gunfire ringing out across town  People cowered in shopping centers and supermarkets and black plumes of smoke rose across the skyline  Chaos continued into the night after a large group of inmates also escaped from the city prison   On Friday  cars navigated burnt out vehicles that partially blocked streets   Gladys McCormick  NYSE MKC   a security analyst at Syracuse University in the United States  said the latest news from Mexico read like that of a country in  the throes of war    What is incontrovertible is that the Sinaloa Cartel won yesterday s battle   she added   Not only did they get the government to release Ovidio  they demonstrated to the citizens of Culiacan as well as the rest of Mexico who is in control   Durazo said the government s decision to free Guzman  involved absolutely no negotiation   Still  questions about how the release was handled continued circulating after defense minister Sandoval said nine security personnel were  held and freed without injury   Meanwhile  Jose Luis Gonzalez Meza  a lawyer for the Guzman family  thanked Lopez Obrador for the government s actions   We have a humane president  a Christian president who in the end decided not to hurt Ovidio   he told a news conference  BLAMING OTHERS Lopez Obrador rejected the suggestion the government had showed weakness in releasing the younger Guzman  describing this view as  conjecture  put about by his adversaries to hurt him  A trenchant critic of past administrations  Lopez Obrador said previous government strategies had turned Mexico into a  graveyard  and that his critics wanted him to continue with it  He argues that authorities should focus more on the root causes of drug violence  such as poverty and a lack of jobs  To boost security  Lopez Obrador has created a new National Guard   but thousands of that militarized police force s members have instead been sent to contain illegal immigration through Mexico at the behest of U S  President Donald Trump  He has also sought to underline his command of law and order by chairing security cabinet meetings every weekday at 6 a m  Still  the murder tally in Mexico this year is on track to surpass last year s record total of more than 29 000  Thursday s events followed the massacre of more than a dozen police in western Mexico earlier this week  and the killing of 14 suspected gangsters by the army a day later  Lopez Obrador said security forces had swooped on the house in Culiacan to capture Ovidio Guzman after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest and extradition  That contradicted the initial version put out on Thursday by the government  which was that the officers had come under fire from the house while passing  then found Guzman inside  The elder Guzman escaped from prison in Mexico twice  in 2001 and 2015  Under the previous administration  security forces captured him two times in Sinaloa  in 2014 and 2016  The previous government extradited him to the United States on the eve of Trump s accession  He was found guilty in a U S  court in February of smuggling tons of drugs and sentenced to life in prison

BEVERLY HILLS  Calif   Reuters    A renovation of the house seen in classic TV show  The Brady Bunch  meticulously replicates the famous wood paneled living room  the orange and green kitchen and even Greg s groovy attic  actors from the series said on Thursday 
Cast members who played the six Brady children reunited to remake the home for a series called  A Very Brady Renovation   which will debut on Discovery Inc s HGTV network in September 
HGTV bought the house outside of Los Angeles that was used for exterior shots of the Brady family home  The network s celebrity design experts worked with the actors to make the interior look like it did on TV  In real life  the inside shots were filmed miles away on Hollywood soundstages 
 It is almost a perfect replication  from fabrics to carpeting  to furniture  to decorating   Barry Williams  NYSE WMB   who played oldest brother Greg  said at a Television Critics Association meeting where networks preview upcoming shows 
The authenticity extended all the way to  the fake grass in the back yard   he said 
Williams worked on recreating the attic that teenage Greg had decked out in 1970s style   Yes  the beaded curtains are there   he said 
 The Brady Bunch  originally aired from 1969 to 1974 on the ABC network and still runs in syndication  One of the first shows to focus on a non traditional family  it centered around a widowed father of three boys who married a single mother with three daughters and served up invariably cheery storylines 
Renovators on the HGTV show added 2 000 square feet of space to the home evoke the original design and include everything from the kids  shared bathroom to architect Mike s den and housekeeper Alice s little seen bedroom 
Each cast member was given a different room to work on and took part in everything from demolition to installing cabinets and hanging artwork 
Christopher Knight  who played middle brother Peter  said he asked to work on the kitchen in part because of his famous  porkchops and applesauce  line in one episode   I had to be close to the food   he joked 
HGTV has not divulged what will happen to the home after the series ends  Because it sits in a residential area  it cannot be opened to tours as a commercial museum  cast members said 
All of the actors said they welcomed the chance to help preserve a piece of TV history 
When the house came up for sale in 2018  Susan Olsen  who played youngest daughter Cindy  said she  worried the wrecking ball might come to it  
 It would kind of be like wrecking the American family   she said

signs that Germany may finally be prepared to accept higher spending to boost its economy means investors are starting to question whether entrenched market pessimism is justified   Economists have for years called on thrifty governments  above all euro zone powerhouse Germany  to spend more to shore up domestic growth  rather than relying on central bank policy to do the trick  After all  a decade of monetary stimulus has not meaningfully eased the economic funk  many argue  For bond investors  extra spending is not just about the increased supply  however limited  that pushes up yields  but also the signal that a commitment to boosting economic growth has on sentiment and market pricing of economic conditions   A German official has told Reuters Berlin might issue new debt to finance a costly climate package  Britain s new prime minister has vowed to increase spending ahead of its exit from the European Union after a decade of austerity  and France and Spain have also expanded expenditure  Italy is pushing hard to be able to run bigger budget deficits   A U turn from Germany  devoted to balanced budgets since 2014   the so called black zero   would be a far bigger deal  and many remain skeptical it will materialize   But the implications are huge   further media reports that Berlin might take on new debt lifted bond yields worldwide on Friday  boosted stocks and expectations of future euro zone inflation   although German Chancellor Angela Merkel has so far fended off the calls for more fiscal stimulus  Essentially  even a small shift in fiscal stance from the euro zone s biggest economy and its benchmark bond issuer would mean it is time to question bond markets  one way direction   Aggressive German fiscal stimulus would be a game changer and should be on your radar for 2020   said NatWest global head of desk strategy Jim McCormick  NYSE MKC   who has been selling five year German bonds versus U S  bonds to play possible German fiscal expansion  Currently  more than  15 trillion worth of bonds globally carry negative yields  In counties such as Germany  the Netherlands and Switzerland  every government bond yields less than zero as investors have bought longer and longer duration debt to grab an extra few basis points of yield  Bigger German budget deficits will almost certainly lift bond yields  but they are still seen as a good thing for Europe  not least if they provide relief to banks  insurers and pension funds which have all suffered from negative interest rates  Mark Haefele  chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management  also says government action on infrastructure should boost returns on investments such as clean energy   Any extra borrowing is seen benefiting green projects and markets could get some clues on Sept  20 when German coalition parties meet to agree steps on fighting climate change    CLEAR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL  Berlin will almost certainly be pushed to run a more proactive fiscal policy by incoming European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde  when she takes over in November   But what might convince Berlin it is time to pull the fiscal lever is growing recession risks   the economy shrank in the second quarter and the Bundesbank is warning of a contraction in the third quarter too   You have a perfect storm for  fiscal stimulus  to work    when Germany was growing strongly it was easy to say they don t need stimulus but that s not the case now   said David Zahn  head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton  What is more negative interest rates   meaning investors pay governments to hold their debt   are a perfect opportunity to borrow and invest without impacting debt sustainability in many countries  ING Bank analysts calculate in fact that Germany could run a fiscal deficit of 1 5  of GDP  swinging from a fiscal surplus of 1 7  in 2018  without worsening its debt ratio of around 60  of annual output  This year  its sovereign interest payments will amount to some 0 8  of GDP  ING says  less than a third of 2008 levels   Germany s overall debt to GDP ratio is expected to fall below the EU s crucial 60  threshold this year  giving Berlin more leeway for future spending   Markets are literally screaming at the German authorities to loosen the fiscal purse strings although to date this has fallen on deaf years   said Mark Dowding  co head of investment grade debt strategy at BlueBay Asset Management in London    We believe there is now a clear direction of travel    NO PANIC Increased government spending usually sparks alarm in bond markets  sending yields spiraling higher   Expected ECB stimulus will keep downward pressure on yields  Also  hardly anyone expects some extra German borrowing to derail the bond bull run  Finance Minister Olaf Scholz mooted stimulus of up to 50 billion euros   55 billion   that too only in a crisis  Templeton s Zahn expects some selling at the margin  adding that  you would have to be talking about spending programs in the trillions to really push it up  yield    Instead  gross German debt supply should clock in at 168 billion euros next year  up from 161 billion euros in 2019  according to Commerzbank  DE CBKG    For an interactive version of the chart   Investors in fact might welcome more debt from Germany as that would alleviate a scarcity of top rated European debt  and at least start to make a dent in the mammoth pool of negative yielding bonds

Citgo  the eighth largest U S  refiner and the most important foreign asset for Venezuela s crisis stricken economy  has been caught up in a political battle as Washington has sought to use it to weaken Maduro s grip on power 
The order signed by a Delaware Chancery Court judge further diminishes Maduro s efforts to reclaim control over Houston based Citgo  a subsidiary of state run PDVSA  The company this month named a former Citgo executive  Carlos Jorda  as its new chief executive officer  succeeding Maduro backed appointee Asdrubal Chavez 
Juan Guaido  the chief of Venezuela s congress who has been recognized by the Trump administration as the South American country s legitimate leader  in February appointed the new board to Citgo  which is incorporated in Delaware  Guaido s team wanted to secure control of the business and protect it from legal attempts to seize Venezuelan foreign assets 
Maduro  who says he is the victim of an attempted U S  led coup  has accused the opposition of trying to  steal  Citgo 
Earlier this month  Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick  NYSE MKC  ruled that the opposition backed directors were legitimately appointed  although she delayed a final order to allow the former directors time to challenge the process 
PDVSA and a lawyer for the former directors did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The former directors could appeal

122067,343582,MKC,This Might Be the Dollar Disaster Bears Have Waited For,news," Bloomberg     The Federal Reserve s big surprise could spell disaster for dollar bulls 
The Bloomberg dollar index tumbled 0 5 percent on Wednesday  making it the worst day since January  after Fed policy makers unexpectedly signaled they d hold their rates benchmark steady all year because of troubling signs from the economy  Among other problems  that could undermine the currency s appeal by cutting into any yield advantage on dollar denominated assets 
Some investors and economists were caught off guard by the extent of dovishness in the statement  The Fed s shift comes a week after hedge funds and speculators boosted bets that the greenback would outperform peers to the highest level since January 
Before Wednesday   we were mildly bullish with the intention of flipping as soon as the Fed signaled that it was done tightening through QE and rate hikes   said Greg Anderson  global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO   The Fed dropped those hints a whole lot faster than we thought  
As 2019 began  dollar bears proclaimed that the Fed would stop or slow interest rate hikes  U S  growth rates wouldn t be able to consistently outperform the rest of the world  and the advantage an investor gets from holding greenbacks would diminish  But the currency generally remained buoyant  The Bloomberg dollar index rose about 7 percent through Tuesday s close from a three year low in February 2018  Then came Wednesday and the revised dot plot    the chart Fed policy makers use to convey their rate forecasts 
 The dots are dinging the dollar   said Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   a foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities  It strengthens the  bearish  case for the greenback  he added 
The Fed s new stance  partially  vindicates the bears  but for the dollar to weaken more  economies outside the U S  will need to perk up  according to Bipan Rai of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
 The key ingredient to ensure that the USD sells off consistently is a pick up in the fundamental story for the euro zone   said Rai  the head of North American foreign exchange strategy at CIBC   We re seeing some nascent signs there  but we need more evidence    especially in Germany  
BNY Mellon also argues a dovish Fed may not doom the dollar  as central banks all over the world move toward the same direction  FX strategist John Velis wrote in a note 
 One would be tempted to think that this still more dovish turn by the Fed will take DXY down  but then again  that prediction would have been sensible in January after the Fed s pause was announced   he said   It didn t happen then  and it might not happen now

122071,343586,MKC,U S  garlic growers profit from trade war as most farmers struggle,news,"By Lucy Nicholson and Richa Naidu
GILROY  California  Reuters    Unlike millions of other U S  farmers  garlic growers are profiting from the trade war with China and have cheered President Donald Trump s latest economic attack accordingly 
Sales of California grown garlic are now increasing after decades of losing ground to cheaper Chinese imports  Sales are poised to get even better as Chinese garlic faces even higher tariffs  with no end to the trade war in sight 
 In a perfect world  we d love to see the tariffs stay on forever   said Ken Christopher  executive vice president of family owned Christopher Ranch  the largest of three remaining commercial garlic producers in the United States 
While many farmers are suffering through the trade war because they relied heavily on imports to China  U S  garlic growers benefit because they rely overwhelmingly on domestic sales 
Tariffs on Chinese garlic increased from 10 to 25 percent on May 9  when the U S  hiked tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese goods and dashed hopes that a U S  China trade deal could come soon 
While soybean farmers in the U S  Midwest watched silos fill with unsold crops as top buyer China all but stopped purchases  Christopher Ranch saw domestic garlic sales rise 15 percent in the last quarter of 2018 after the U S  applied a 10 percent tariff on imports of Chinese garlic in September 
Then Trump ordered even higher tariffs this month after trade talks broke down when China backtracked on a host of issues crucial to U S  officials 
The escalation came just a few weeks before the U S  garlic harvest 
 The timing couldn t be better for us   Christopher said   We anticipate a surge in demand for California garlic in the coming weeks  
Christopher  33  whose farm has 59 000 acres of grass like garlic fields in Gilroy  California  traveled to Washington D C  in July to urge the Trump administration to include garlic in the list of imports that would face tariffs 
In lobbying for tariffs  Christopher follows in the footsteps of his father  who fought to implement an anti dumping duty of up to 400 percent on Chinese garlic in the 1990s 
 We understand in a broader economic sense that a trade war is not in the U S  best interest   he said   But since the tariffs were happening anyway  we needed to be sure that garlic was part of the equation  
Not everyone is a fan of the garlic tariff  While Christopher was testifying in favor of tariffs to congressional committees  executives from one of the world s top seasoning companies  McCormick   Company  NYSE MKC  Inc   were arguing against them 
McCormick says its recipes mostly rely on Chinese garlic  calling it a different product from what is grown in the United States 
 They re not substitutable   CEO Lawrence Kurzius told Reuters in an interview   Just like wine  origin matters and terroir matter  
Taste differences aside  California garlic has traditionally sold at far higher prices than Chinese garlic  It now sells for about  60 per 30 pound box on the wholesale market  according to Christopher  Until recently  Chinese garlic sold for  20 per box  but that has risen to  40 with tariffs and will likely soon rise further  he said 
The new profits U S  garlic farmers have enjoyed from tariffs are an exception in the U S  farm sector 
China last year retaliated to Trump s tariffs with duties on U S  goods including soybeans  corn and pork 
Trump has pledged up to an additional  20 billion in aid to help U S  farmers hurt by the prolonged dispute after groups such as the American Soybean Association criticized the failure to reach a deal  That s on top of  12 billion the administration promised last year to compensate farmers for trade war losses 
The trade war has also left many West Coast specialty crop farmers  like nut and cherry growers  scrambling to find alternative markets after China imposed steep duties on imports that made their products too expensive to sell there 
Jamie Johansson  an olive farmer and president of the California farm bureau   which represents 400 crops and 36 000 members   said the Trump administration had put California farmers in the middle of tariff wars with four of the state s five top markets  including China 

 Among our members  I have not heard of anyone benefiting from the current trade war and tariffs   Johansson said

122072,343587,MKC,U S  election cybersecurity agency staff  strained to the breaking point ,news,"By Christopher Bing
WASHINGTON  Reuters    As the U S  government prepares to defend the 2020 presidential election from cyber threats  the federal agency charged with helping administer elections  the Election Assistance Commission  says it is  strained to the breaking point   according to Chairwoman Christy McCormick  NYSE MKC  
 Obviously we re a very small agency and quite under funded   McCormick said on Wednesday during a House of Representatives Oversight Committee hearing   We re stretched very thin  
McCormick told lawmakers the agency is seeking additional funding from Congress  That funding is part of a sweeping election reform package  known as H R  1  which passed the House earlier this year but has yet to be voted on in the Senate 
Multiple federal agencies  including the Justice Department  Homeland Security Department and intelligence community  play a role in protecting U S  elections from foreign interference 
The Election Assistance Commission is responsible for setting standards and guidelines for election officials and voting equipment makers  But since the 2016 U S  presidential election  the agency has also taken on additional responsibilities related to cybersecurity  McCormick said 
 We re asking for more money so we can hire more staff to meet the demands  The EAC s mission has expanded since it was created   said McCormick   We didn t have the cybersecurity needs at the time  We always worried about election security but since 2016  this is an additional mission for our agency  And we ve stepped up in every way we can given the resources we have  
Those comments follow a prediction in late April by FBI Director Christopher Wray that the Russian government and others will likely attempt to meddle in the 2020 U S  presidential election 
Lawmakers expressed concern on Wednesday about the EAC s ability to perform its responsibilities because of a lack of resources 
 The pressure on you and the work that needs to be done has risen exponentially and you re trying to do this with less resources and less people   said Massachusetts Democrat Rep  Stephen Lynch   I am worried  
McCormick told lawmakers last week that the agency s budget had been cut by 50 percent since 2010  when it had 49 staffers 
 If there s going to be any practical impact on what happens in 2020 given the threats that have been discussed here today  urgent action is needed   said Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin  who also testified during the same hearing on Wednesday   Particularly at the level of the EAC  ",2019-05-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/us-election-cybersecurity-agency-staff-strained-to-the-breaking-point-1876447,1876447
122073,343588,MKC,Spice maker McCormick s quest to make your vanilla milkshake cheaper,news,"By Richa Naidu CHICAGO ANTANANARIVO  Madagascar  Reuters    A kilo of vanilla beans costs more than a kilo of silver  Cultivated painstakingly over years from an orchid plant  vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world  after saffron  In less than five years  the wholesale price has risen nearly 500 percent  partly because of growing global demand for healthy  natural ingredients  But supply is an issue too  Cyclones  drought and crop theft have hit Madagascar in recent years  slashing into the tender crop s quality and quantity  The African island nation produces about 80 percent of the world s vanilla  For McCormick  NYSE MKC    Co  the world s largest spice company  the scarcity of vanilla has become too big a risk to ignore  spurring it to begin cultivating an alternative source on the north coast of Papua  Indonesia  McCormick  which sells vanilla and its extract to retailers  restaurants and packaged food makers  said it has been passing the higher costs on to buyers  The price of black whole bean Madagascar vanilla  the benchmark product  costs  520 per kilo  While this isn t quite the spice s record high of  635 per kilo   reached after a ruinous cyclone in 2017   it is still nearly six times the price of  87 50 per kilo in early 2015  Back to back typhoons in 2017 and 2018  definitely put input pressure on costs   Nestle SA  SIX NESN  U S  CEO Steve Presley recently told Reuters  The world s No 1 food company raised prices for U S  ice cream products in 2017  partly due to mounting vanilla prices  he said  The Swiss food giant makes Haagen Dazs  Edy s and Skinny Cow ice creams  which tout natural vanilla flavoring or beans on their labels   General Mills   NYSE GIS   which sells Haagen Dazs outside the United States and in the brand s international ice cream parlors  said higher vanilla costs were forcing prices upward   Now  Donald Pratt  managing director of McCormick s global procurement arm  said the company is looking to Indonesia as a possible solution to the industry s supply problem  But pulling this off may be an uphill task  Indonesia produces only about 100 tonnes of whole vanilla beans a year  a far cry from Madagascar s output of about 2000 tonnes  Pratt said  And some others who have tried to cultivate a secondary source for vanilla have not been successful   Unilever s Ben   Jerry s  for instance   invested heavily  in a similar project that backfired in Uganda   THE DARK SIDE OF VANILLA  Vanilla   sometimes called green gold   is so coveted thieves will kill for it   This is the dark side of vanilla  You don t realize because it s such a sweet thing   said Cheryl Pinto of Ben   Jerry s  which uses vanilla in most of its ice creams  as well as in other items such as cookie dough chunks  Pinto said she is in charge of managing the company s supply chain with a  social mission  in mind  To protect their crop in Uganda   farmers were sleeping in these fields and there were murders and beatings   she said   It was awful    This month  when setting harvest dates  the Ugandan government called out  cases of theft and loss of lives  spurred by higher prices  The violence goes both ways  Last year  Reuters reported Malagasy growers defending their fields by beating apprehended suspects to death  Vanilla is valuable largely because it is laborious to grow  For a graphic on vanilla cultivation and cost  see  New vanilla vines take three to four years to produce orchids and can only be pollinated   by hand   a few days each year during a pre dawn  four hour window  From bloom to sale  the average production cycle is 16 18 months  and 600 hand pollinated flowers yield only about 1 kilo of dried beans   The vines can flourish only if intertwined with small trees that provide support and shade  And they must be grown close to the equator  Bourbon vanilla  which McCormick sells  is by far the most popular variety in the world  Though it has historically been cultivated in Mexico  it mostly has been produced in Madagascar for the past century because many farmers elsewhere found it such a time consuming  delicate crop  not worth the uncertainty and price fluctuations  Pratt said he doesn t yet know how much Indonesia would have to produce to calm market prices  Tam Hun Man Tombo  a vanilla exporter in Madagascar  is skeptical farmers elsewhere are up to the task   I ve been in the vanilla business for more than 30 years  and every time I hear the same refrain  Buyers are looking for other origins  buyers will be working with farmers in other countries   he said   It is a threat to which we are accustomed  But we do not fear that too much  Indonesia cannot produce vanilla as good as Madagascar  To boost production quickly  McCormick is scaling up training programs in Papuan farming communities  To produce beans of Madagascar s quality   to which consumers are accustomed   McCormick has been changing some practices related to soil and water management   McCormick is in discussions with CARE  a non governmental organization that helped re establish the market in Madagascar after the 2017 cyclone destroyed about 30 percent of the island s vanilla crops  The agency has founded cooperatives in Indonesia as well as Madagascar that provide training for growers   often women   on crop production and management  as well as aspects of financial literacy  CARE has suggested other geographic alternatives  as well  including Uganda and Tanzania  said Elly Kaganzi  deputy director of CARE s agriculture   market systems   Pinto told Reuters Ben   Jerry s efforts in Uganda foundered  however  because eastern buyers   mainly from China   swooped in and  showed up to the village with a boatload of cash  ahead of the government sanctioned harvest date   We have not been able to get any vanilla out of Uganda   Pinto said  Ben   Jerry s says it hasn t raised prices due to vanilla costs  choosing to absorb them and stay competitive  But retail prices for other companies  vanilla containing products  from coffee sweetners to yogurt to extract  continue marching upward   As of May 30  a 2 fluid ounce bottle of McCormick s Vanilla Extract from Walmart  NYSE WMT  com cost  8 12  up from  5 94 in May 2015  according to the retail consulting firm GlobalData   
 Vanilla has always been a store cupboard staple  a common product   said Neil Saunders  who heads the firm   Consumers might be surprised at the high cost  but what can they do if everyone from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to Walmart is raising prices  ",2019-06-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/spice-maker-mccormicks-quest-to-make-your-vanilla-milkshake-cheaper-1885867,1885867

122109,343624,MKC,Bond Traders Everywhere Reprice Rate Outlook as Growth Sputters,news," Bloomberg     It s not just in the U S  that confidence in higher interest rates is faltering  Bond and money market traders around the world are reassessing the pace of tightening amid signs global growth is sputtering 
Traders were cutting back bets on Federal Reserve hikes in 2019 even before dovish remarks from Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door for a potential pullback next year  Minutes from the Fed s meeting earlier this month also set the stage for more flexibility  Meanwhile  the European Central Bank s long anticipated rate increase is looking less likely  while the probability of a move in Australia is continually being pushed back 
Central banks may have good reason to turn more dovish  The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for world growth last month  and warned this week that the outlook may have gotten even worse  That s been reflected in increasing financial market turbulence  with stocks sinking in the fourth quarter and credit spreads widening  Meanwhile  falling oil prices are taming inflation expectations 
Here s how the slowing growth theme is seen playing out in each of the major markets  along with recommendations from strategists on possible ways to trade it 
U S   Don t Fade the Fed
U S  interest rate pricing shows the market is expecting a 25 basis point hike next month  and no more than one additional increase next year  That s less than the consensus among analysts and below the Fed s own forecasts 
 We ve reached a tipping point in terms of how much rate hikes by the Fed can be tolerated   said Yvette Klevan  fixed income portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management in New York   In the U S  we re seeing the housing market roll over  mortgage rates touching 5 percent  and you ve started to see equity markets correct and head south   Klevan expects the Fed to pause after raising rates this December and March next year  with any further tightening being data dependent 
To be sure  U S  growth is still running strong at present  and for those keeping the faith  it spells opportunity  There s a low risk that the Fed will deviate from its path  over the next 2 3 hikes   Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  strategist Zach Pandl wrote in the investment bank s 2019 outlook published this month  He recommends betting the yield gap between two year and 30 year U S  Treasuries would narrow  a so called flattener trade  as shorter maturity yields are set to rise 
Europe  Ignoring Guidance
While the ECB has been clinging to guidance that rates will rise after the summer  weakening economic data are leaving markets increasingly doubtful  Overnight swap rates are only pricing in the first full 15 basis point rate hike for March 2020 
The central bank won t hike next year because macro risks and personnel changes will make the move difficult  NatWest Markets strategist James McCormick  NYSE MKC  says  The company recommends a cocktail of long positions in the front end  including a bet on forward Eonia rates and two year German notes 
Not everyone has given up  A depressed mood and dovish ECB expectations mean there s  fundamental asymmetry  in European rates  said Adam Kurpiel  head of rates strategy at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA  Expect a September rate hike and look at a variety of bearish conditional trades in option markets to capture this  he said 
Further north in Sweden  data today showed the economy surprisingly contracted in the third quarter  casting doubts over the central bank s plan to raise rates as soon as next month  Rabobank this week lowered its forecast for the Norwegian krone  citing doubts about Norges Bank s monetary policy  as well as lower oil prices 
Australia  Slow Progress
A cooling global economy is especially significant for Australia given the nation s place in the global supply chain  Markets are giving around 50 percent chance of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia in the fourth quarter of next year  with a slowing housing market seen as the major obstacle 
As growth slows  there may be another year of stable RBA policy  Sally Auld  a senior strategist at JP Morgan Securities Australia Ltd  in Sydney  wrote in a client note  The company recommends going long Australian rates through receiving short dated interest swaps versus the U S 
Still  with unemployment falling   the case for an RBA rate hike in 2019 is pretty compelling   NatWest s McCormick said  He recommended going long Australian dollars versus the Canadian and New Zealand currencies 
U K   Brexit Dominates
For the U K   everything depends on the outcome of the vote to leave the European Union  The next 25 basis point hike from the Bank of England isn t fully priced in until February 2020  reflecting a hefty Brexit discount 
Strategists are optimistic  There is a consensus view that a hard Brexit will be avoided  allowing the BOE to gear up rate hikes earlier than priced  A variety of trades expressing this view are being recommended for 2019  McCormick recommends being short gilts and long sterling  while Societe Generale s Kurpiel advises using swap rates to position for a steeper spread between 2 year and 5 year contracts 
Canada  A Little Crude
Rate hike odds in Canada have been trimmed as global oil prices slump  though with the nation s economy closely tied to the prospects of its southern neighbor  markets are still primed for two 25 basis point moves in 2019 
Declining commodity prices mean markets are now underpricing rate hikes as the Bank of Canada is likely to raise rates three times in 2019  says TD Securities Senior Canada Rates Strategist Andrew Kelvin  The bank recommends a variety of short positions in near dated interest rates including positioning for a higher rate hike premium for the March 2019 BOC meeting and also in the fourth quarter 
Japan  Outside Chance of Hikes
Most strategists have ignored the front end of Japan s interest rate curve when making their predictions for next year  and with good reason  The gentle upward slope of the overnight rates curve shows minimal rate hike expectations are priced in 
But some see the chance for some action here  The Bank of Japan will raise its short term rate by 10 basis points to zero in April 2019    ending its negative interest rate policy    with a view to making the overall easing framework more sustainable   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  MUFJ strategists  including Koichi Sugisaki in Tokyo  wrote in a client note this week 
While 10 year rates may see upward pressure  the market is unlikely to price in a chance of additional hikes  he said   Barclays   LON BARC  strategists are also looking for a one and done hike from the central bank  with July as the most likely timing to pull trigger 
New Zealand  Milking It
Rising volatility in New Zealand s markets has seen the chance of a rate cut next year ruled out and the prospects for a rate hike in early 2020 rise to around 50 percent 
Cross market rates trades are the best way to position for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  according to National Australia Bank Ltd   More rate hike risk should be priced into New Zealand than the Australia curve  given the higher core inflation relative to target  writes Alex Stanley  a senior rates strategist in Sydney  Investors should look at five year interest rate swap wideners between New Zealand and Australia  he said

122115,343630,MKC,From Poster Child to Problem Child  The Canadian Dollar in 2019,news," Bloomberg     Canada s dollar may have gotten off to a flying start in 2019  outperforming all its Group of 10 peers except the British pound  but those good times may be a thing of the past 
Weaker than expected local economic data is combining with a decidedly more downbeat view from the central bank to put a damper on the currency  and some analysts are calling for the loonie to weaken significantly as the year progresses 
Prospects for the Canadian dollar  have shifted considerably to the downside over the medium term   according to Mazen Issa and Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   foreign exchange strategists at TD Securities  The currency has established itself as a  problem child  among G 10 peers and  the positives are hard to find   they wrote in a note Friday 
That wasn t the case earlier in the year  In January  the Canadian dollar outstripped all its G 10 peers to notch a gain of almost 4 percent  It s struggled since then though  with the Bank of Canada last week watering down talk of higher rates  and economic growth figures earlier this month coming in worse than expected  The loonie is now close to 2 percent below its early February peak and it was around C 1 3343 per U S  dollar in New York trading Friday following poor housing data this week 
 Citigroup   NYSE C  technical strategists including Tom Fitzpatrick are also painting a bearish picture for the Canadian dollar  Based on their analysis  they are targeting a range of C 1 36 to C 1 37 per U S  dollar  The dollar loonie pair appears to be holding good support and an upward trend may re emerge in the pair should the loonie hold support around C 1 3288 to C 1 3291  in their view 
To be sure  some market watchers are not so pessimistic about the loonie  Data trends remain positive for the Canadian dollar as U S  data disappointments  far outweigh  the improving trend in Canadian data surprises  according to Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret at Scotiabank 
Risk reversals suggest a  modest improvement  in Canadian dollar sentiment and Scotia s modeling shows  modest downside risks  for the dollar loonie pair in the coming week  according to a note published Friday  Scotiabank expects the pair to trade within a range of C 1 3300 to C 1 3450 for now  but that with spreads between American and Canadian yields unlikely to widen much more  the U S  currency s ability to rally will be constrained  the analysts say 
TD is more pessimistic about the Canadian dollar  On Friday the bank downgraded its forecasts for the Canadian dollar  and it now sees it trading within a range of C 1 35 to C 1 40 per dollar for much of this year  That follows an earlier call from TD for the BOC to keep rates on hold through 2020 
And the analysts say that the balance of risks for their dollar loonie forecasts  may be skewed to the upside   Their projections are based on an assumption that the Bank of Canada will remain on hold  but they do note  a case could be made for easier policy    especially if the global outlook does not improve  ",2019-03-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/from-poster-child-to-problem-child-the-canadian-dollar-in-2019-1809310,1809310

122199,343714,MKC,America s Booming Economy Comes With a Cost for Global Growth,news," Bloomberg     Making America great again isn t proving so great for other parts of the world 
With the rise in the dollar and interest rates already squeezing emerging economies just as President Donald Trump s trade war threatens China  the U S  is set to be the only Group of Seven nation to see economic growth accelerate this year as Trump s tax cuts kick in 
The end of the short lived euphoria of a synchronized global upswing is already evident in financial markets  NatWest Markets notes its basket of so called growth assets such as the Australian dollar and copper is down about 4 5 percent this year compared with the almost 7 percent gain of the Standard   Poor s 500 Index 
The gap in performance  certainly captures the imbalanced nature of growth this year   said Jim McCormick  NYSE MKC   head of cross asset strategy at NatWest 
The global backdrop will frame discussions when the Federal Reserve holds its annual policy symposium this week in Jackson Hole  Wyoming  at which Chairman Jerome Powell will speak  The Fed s two interest rate hikes of 2018 have helped lift the dollar almost 6 percent on a trade weighted basis this year  making it costlier for international borrowers to repay loans 
Minutes of the Fed s most recent policy meeting  due later on Wednesday  may provide clues on the outlook for rates in 2019  For now  Mark Nash  head of fixed income at Old Mutual Global Investors  bets the domestic economy will keep the central bank raising rates although it could end up creating headwinds for itself 
 Once that pain in emerging markets gets particularly acute  that naturally will spread back to the U S  and change things in terms of how the Fed needs to manage domestic monetary policy   he said on Bloomberg Television   For now  you can t fault what Powell is doing  but the implications of it might come back to haunt him  
Evidence of a moderation outside of the U S  is already visible  Economists at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   say although overall global growth is higher than its long term trend thanks to the U S   the share of countries performing above potential has fallen to 60 percent from about 80 percent in 2017 
China s momentum has stalled as policy makers curb risky lending and the trade dispute with the U S  begins to bite  prompting policy makers to shift gears to signal a willingness to support activity  Economists also see a slowdown in Japan 
Across much of Europe  surveys and confidence indicators have turned lower this year in part because of export concerns  German factory orders    a gauge of future output in the euro area s largest economy    posted their first annual decline in almost two years in June 
Italy is squaring up for a clash with investors over its fiscal plans  with implications for debt costs  while there s no end to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit in the U K 
Then there s emerging markets  Turkey s lira has plunged amid a political crisis  Venezuela has executed one of the biggest devaluations in history and Argentina is jacking up rates to protect its currency  While none have the heft to drag the global economy into a recession  the resulting fallout on markets could be a blow to confidence if the pain spreads to emerging market powerhouses such as Brazil 
Tom Orlik  chief economist at Bloomberg Economics  doesn t expect emerging markets take down the world  He observes that excluding China  emerging and developing economies accounted for 24 6 percent of global output last year  down from a peak of 26 7 percent in 2013 
Cross border trade is though deteriorating  with growth rates in emerging economies slowing by a fifth in August  according to a gauge by logistics giant Kuehne   Nagel Group  They calculate that commerce in Brazil  South Korea  Taiwan  and India is shrinking by more than 5 percent year on year 
Asia s slowing bears watching  Excluding Japan  the region s contribution to global growth was 40 percent in 2017 compared with 23 percent in 2007  reflecting its larger economic size and deepening integration with the world  according to Robert Subbaraman  Singapore based head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holding 
 It is no longer a question of  if  but more a matter of  how much  Asian growth will slow in the second half   Subbaraman said

122233,343748,MKC,U S  Supreme Court bankruptcy ruling reignites  8 billion Tribune case,news,By Tom Hals WILMINGTON  Del   Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Tuesday trimmed a key legal defense that has frustrated creditors who try to claw back potentially dubious payments made before a corporate bankruptcy in a ruling that will reignite litigation over the 2007 buyout of Tribune Co  At issue is a federal bankruptcy provision  called the safe harbor  that prevents certain securities transactions  including payments to shareholders  from being unwound by representatives of a bankrupt company s estate  Creditor attorneys have increasingly complained that bankrupt companies structure payments to take advantage of the safe harbor  which U S  Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi called a  too good to be true  defense in 2014 testimony to Congress  In a unanimous decision  the high court ruled that safe harbor did not protect payments if financial institutions were merely conduits  reversing the law in the key bankruptcy courts in Delaware and New York    The safe harbor defense was getting raised all over the place   said Edward Weisfelner  a bankruptcy lawyer with Brown Rudnick who represents creditors   For those of us on the plaintiffs side     it s about time    In the case before the Supreme Court  racetrack operator Valley View Downs LP borrowed  55 million to buy all the shares of Bedford Downs Management Corp  Valley View filed for bankruptcy protection soon after  and its trustee sought to claw back the funds paid to Bedford shareholders  arguing that Valley View was insolvent at the time of the deal  The Supreme Court rejected the argument of Merit Management Group LP  one of the shareholders  that the payments were protected by the safe harbor  The court found that the banks that handled the funds were conduits   The ruling will have an immediate effect on the long running litigation stemming from the leveraged buyout of the Tribune media company in 2007  a deal that was led by real estate mogul Sam Zell   Less than a year after the deal closed  Tribune filed for bankruptcy  saddled with unsustainable debt taken on to buy out shareholders  A litigation trustee has been trying to claw back some of the  8 billion in payments to Tribune s 5 500 shareholders  and made a settlement offer in January that will now be withdrawn in the wake of Tuesday s ruling    I am gratified that the Supreme Court corrected the mistaken view of the law   said Marc Kirschner  the Tribune litigation trustee  The Tribune settlement varied  depending on the amount of stock sold into the two step buyout  For example  shareholders who sold between  1 million and  10 million in stock could have settled for 27 5 percent of the payments received in step one and for 55 percent received in step two  Some of the largest shareholders included the Chandler Trusts and the McCormick  NYSE MKC  Foundation  according to court records ,2018-02-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-supreme-court-bankruptcy-ruling-reignites-8-billion-tribune-case-1315090,1315090
122234,343749,MKC,U S  dollar outlook darkens as trade war looms,news,"By Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  dollar could face headwinds if President Donald Trump s proposals to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are enacted  with the biggest risk stemming from the possible flight of capital flows needed to finance ballooning U S  deficits  Currency markets  in general  dislike any form of trade intervention and previous protectionist efforts by the U S  government have resulted in dollar weakness    The U S  is now in a very precarious position because it s putting a risk premium on U S  assets by introducing tariffs and going down this protectionist route  which is negative for growth   said Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   head of North American FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto  The introduction of import tariffs threatens to increase the price of foreign products in the United States  reducing demand and imports   Tariffs introduced by Presidents George W  Bush and Bill Clinton in 2002 and 1995 had resulted in a 15 percent decline in the dollar overall  according to estimates from TD Securities  although there were other factors that also undermined the U S  currency during those periods  The biggest risk for the dollar stems from the possible exodus of capital flows  analysts said  If risk sentiment worsens significantly  this would outweigh any short term advantage the dollar would have against emerging markets in its role as a safe haven bet  they said  Trump said on Thursday duties of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week  although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out  The dollar fell against most currencies after the announcement  falling to a more than two year low versus the yen  Trump s comments have already caused an uproar in the international community  provoking a reaction from Canada  whose foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland said the country  will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers    Other countries such were already looking at how to respond  Europe has drawn up a list of U S  products on which to apply tariffs if Trump follows through on his plan  Analysts  meanwhile  are monitoring how China would react  China  while currently accounting for only a minor share of U S  steel imports due to existing trade barriers  is by far the world s largest producer   Retaliation by other countries could prompt the withdrawal of capital flows from the United States at a time when the country has to finance its burgeoning twin deficits  analysts said  The capital flow dynamic has changed over the last five to six years and countries such as China  Japan  and Europe have turned net creditors  pushing money overseas in search of the best yielding asset   On the other hand  the United States  while still the largest economy in the world  has become a net debtor  with current account and fiscal deficits seen exceeding more than 8 percent of gross domestic product over the next two years  analysts said  Part of the expansion in the U S  budget shortfall is attributed to the Trump administration s tax overhaul and fiscal stimulus   To bridge those deficits  the United States needs to borrow from overseas  Analysts said about 60 percent of U S  deficits are funded by foreign countries or entities    The countries you re basically having a trade war with    you re basically poking China and Europe    are the countries that you will be relying on to finance your deficit   said McCormick  NEGATIVE FOR GROWTH  In addition  any impact on U S  growth   though this is expected to be limited   could undercut the dollar  analysts said  Andrew Hunter  U S  economist at Capital Economics in London  said while the direct effect of tariffs may be minimal because steel and aluminum products account for just over 2 percent of overall imports  the  knock on impact  on industries that use these products would be greater  He added that domestic U S  steel prices have already risen by 20 percent since the start the year in anticipation of protectionist measures and this could be a significant drag on steel consumers like the machinery  motor vehicle and construction industries   The Fed will presumably look through the temporary impact on inflation from higher imported steel prices  but it will find it harder to ignore any resulting upward pressure on wages and prices stemming from the increased demand among domestic  steel and aluminum  producers   said Hunter   This may yet be another reason to expect the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year  But some analysts said this may not necessarily boost the dollar since this outlook for interest rates is being driven not by expectations of stronger growth  but by fears of fiscal and political instability and inflation spiraling out of control   U S  STEEL

122264,343779,MKC,Dollar Staggers Into 2018 With Global Reflation Trade in Play,news," Bloomberg     The dollar sank to a three month low as rising commodity prices reignited bets that the global reflation trade will take hold in 2018  dimming the greenback s appeal relative to currencies of faster growing economies 
The U S  currency fell against most major and emerging market counterparts Tuesday as the Bloomberg Commodity Index reached its highest level in about 11 months  Combined with reports showing strength in Chinese and European manufacturing  there is probably more pain ahead for the dollar as investors anticipate money flowing into other economies  said Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC  at Toronto Dominion Bank 
 The backdrop for the dollar is just not very good   said McCormick  the bank s North American head of foreign exchange strategy   The global reflation trade is progressing along and the backdrop is that we re rotating into a regime shift and that comes with a changing backdrop for capital flows  
Dollar weakness will also persist through 2018 as more central banks move toward policy normalization  according to McCormick  European Central Bank policy maker Benoit Coeure suggested as much over the weekend  saying that unless inflation disappoints  there s a  reasonable chance  the central bank s extension of quantitative easing in October could be the final one  
The greenback could catch a break as the U S  tax overhaul plan takes effect  said Brad Bechtel  a currency strategist at Jefferies  Though American companies  estimated  2 6 trillion of cash stashed overseas may already be mostly in dollars  the greenback will still benefit from the return of funds held in other currencies  according to Bechtel 
That said  it s far from smooth sailing for dollar bulls  especially if investors see better value in other currencies with global growth picking up  Against that backdrop  the dollar faces a cloudy outlook even as the Federal Reserve signals more rate hikes in 2018  Bechtel said 
 Commodities have been rallying across the board  and that s putting some pressure on the dollar   he said   It s a tough road ahead for the dollar  ",2018-01-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/dollar-staggers-into-2018-with-global-reflation-trade-in-play-1053161,1053161
122269,343784,MKC,Currency Traders Brace for Possibility of  Hawkish Hold  by BOC,news," Bloomberg     Foreign exchange traders who had all but priced in a Bank of Canada rate hike are suddenly paying up to hedge against the risk of a letdown at Wednesday s policy meeting 
The country s five biggest lenders all brought forward their rate hike expectations to January from April this month after the nation s jobless rate dropped to its lowest in more than 40 years  But the cost to protect against loonie losses has skyrocketed after reports the U S  would withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement gave investors pause and thrust the prospect of a stand pat BOC into the spotlight 
Implied volatility contracts with a tenor of one week spiked to 10 6 intraday Tuesday  the highest since the days surrounding the central bank s September gathering  when officials shocked markets with their second hike in as many meetings  The loonie fell as much as about 0 95 percent Jan  10  the most in more than two months  the day the Nafta speculation swirled  The Canadian currency has gained about 6 percent versus the U S  dollar in the past 12 months  and the pair currently trades around C 1 2430 
The market implied odds that the BOC raises rates this week still stand at about 92 percent  based on overnight index swap pricing  They fell to as low as 73 percent last week after Canadian officials said they saw an increasing likelihood that U S  President Donald Trump would withdraw from Nafta  Twenty six of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the central bank will raise its benchmark rate 25 basis points to 1 25 percent 
 There are more two way risks around the hike than the bond market is pricing in   said Mark McCormick  NYSE MKC   a strategist at TD Securities  which pushed forward its rate increase call to January  McCormick said he puts the odds of a rate boost this week around 65 percent 
Even if the BOC did hike  it probably wouldn t do much to help the Canadian dollar since Nafta talks resume next week and there s more at stake in the next round of negotiations  McCormick said 
 Hawkish Hold 
If the Bank of Canada does raise rates Wednesday  it could signal that further increases are unlikely to be aggressive  a so called  dovish  hike  in an effort to extend the economy s stellar 2017 performance  And if it leaves rates unchanged  the bank could still offer a resolute tone on gradual tightening as policy makers must now be wary of stoking inflation 
 In the event that we do get a hike  it would be a dovish hike   said Eric Theoret  a currency strategist at Scotiabank   In the event we get a hold  it would be a hawkish hold because in the event of a hold  I don t think it s an environment in which they d want to ease financial conditions  That s the outcome I would lean toward  a hawkish hold  
Scotiabank s house view is for a rate increase Wednesday  though Theoret says  the hawkish hold is underappreciated as an outcome  
Following the report on Canadian officials  concerns about Nafta negotiations  a White House official said there hasn t been any change in the president s position on the agreement  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Jan  11 he expects the pact  will be renegotiated  or we ll pull out  
The sixth round of Nafta talks is scheduled to start Jan  23 in Montreal  Canada  Mexico and the U S  have already planned a subsequent round of talks in February in Mexico City  two people familiar with plans said ",2018-01-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/currency-traders-brace-for-possibility-of-hawkish-hold-by-boc-1110390,1110390

U S  President Donald Trump s long awaited tax reform plan supported gains a day earlier as the framework proposed bringing the corporate tax rate to 20  from 35  as expected 
Concerns for its future were raised over the uphill battle in Congress  with the Republican Party divided over it and Democrats hostile  and some observers considered to the framework to be lacking in detail 
 Without sufficient details on how or even if these tax cuts will be fully paid for  this outline is nothing more than a fiscal fantasy   the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget noted 
ING economists noted that  the release hasn t added to what we already knew  
 What was meant to be a  very comprehensive report  was thin on the key details that U S  markets crave to make any meaningful assessment of the likelihood of a Trump tax plan being successfully signed into law and its overall economic impact   they explained 
In economic releases on Thursday  U S  second quarter economic growth was unexpectedly revised upwards to 3 1   although markets showed little reaction to the report 
On the downside  weekly jobless claims rose slightly more than expected  with a reading of 272 000  topping the forecast for 270 000 
On the central bank front  Federal Reserve policymakers gave no surprises 
Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren once again argued late Wednesday for a  regular and gradual  increase in interest rates 
Kansas City Fed President Esther George commented that the second quarter growth data was a good rebound from the weaker reading seen in the first three months of the year and also agreed with the Fed outlook that it was appropriate to move forward with gradual rate hikes 
Outgoing Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer mostly steered clear of comments on monetary policy  focusing instead on central bank independence at a conference held by the Bank of England  However  the number 2 at the U S  central bank did comment that it was important to reduce the size of the Fed s balance sheet as the measures were temporary

122328,343843,MKC,From disputes to a breakup  wounds still raw after U S  election,news,"By John Whitesides WASHINGTON  Reuters    Burning passions over Donald Trump s presidency are taking a personal toll on both sides of the political divide  For Gayle McCormick  NYSE MKC   it is particularly wrenching  she has separated from her husband of 22 years  The retired California prison guard  a self described  Democrat leaning toward socialist   was stunned when her husband casually mentioned during a lunch with friends last year that he planned to vote for Trump   a revelation she described as a  deal breaker    It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump   said McCormick  73  who had not thought of leaving the conservative Republican before but felt  betrayed  by his support for Trump   I felt like I had been fooling myself   she said   It opened up areas between us I had not faced before  I realized how far I had gone in my life to accept things I would have never accepted when I was younger   Three months after the most divisive election in modern U S  politics fractured families and upended relationships  a number of Americans say the emotional wounds are as raw as ever and show few signs of healing  The rancor has not dissipated as it has in the aftermath of other recent contentious U S  elections  A Reuters Ipsos opinion poll shows it has worsened  suggesting a widening of the gulf between Republicans and Democrats and a hardening of ideological positions that sociologists and political scientists say increases distrust in government and will make political compromise more difficult  The Reuters Ipsos poll of 6 426 people  taken from Dec  27 to Jan  18  shows the number of respondents who argued with family and friends over politics jumped 6 percentage points from a pre election poll at the height of the campaign in October  up to 39 percent from 33 percent   See graphic    Sixteen percent said they have stopped talking to a family member or friend because of the election   up marginally from 15 percent  That edged higher  to 22 percent  among those who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton  Overall  13 percent of respondents said they had ended a relationship with a family member or close friend over the election  compared to 12 percent in October   It s been pretty rough for me   said Rob Brunello  25  of Mayfield Heights  Ohio  a truck driver who faced a backlash from friends and family for backing Trump   People couldn t believe Trump could beat Hillary  They are having a hard time adjusting to it   he said  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the poll results  AMID THE RANCOR  FRIENDSHIPS BLOOM At the same time  many people reported their relationships have not suffered because of the election  The poll found about 40 percent had not argued with a family member or friend over the race      The election also enabled a significant number to forge new bonds   21 percent said they became friends with someone they did not know because of the election  though the poll question did not ask respondents to specify if the friendship was with someone from a different party      Sandi Corbin  a retiree in East Galesburg  Illinois  said she has visited some of the new friends she made because of their shared support for Clinton   We talk all the time now   she said   I would say that s a plus from the election   The election s fervor has spilled into the streets since Trump s inauguration on Jan  20  Hundreds of thousands of people marched in protest on the day after Trump took office  and there have been demonstrations against a travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim majority countries  Arguing over Trump has become a bitter reality for many Americans   Once people found out I had voted for Trump the stuff started flying   said William Lomey  64  a retired cop in Philadelphia who no longer speaks with a friend he grew up with after they clashed on Facebook  NASDAQ FB  over the election   I questioned him on a few things  he didn t like it  he blew up and left me a nasty message and we haven t talked since   He said his friend is gay and worries about Trump s sometimes demeaning campaign rhetoric about minority groups including Muslims  Hispanics  immigrants and the disabled   I think people are getting too wound up   Lomey said  Sue Koren  57  a Clinton supporter in Dayton  Ohio  said she can barely speak to her two Trump backing sons and has unfriended  maybe about 50  people on Facebook who support the president   Life is not what it was before the election   she said   It s my anger  my frustration  my disbelief  They think our current president is a hero and I think he s a nut   George Ingmire  48  a radio documentary producer in New Orleans  said he broke off a close relationship with an uncle who had helped him through his father s suicide because of his uncle s fervent support for Trump   We had some back and forth and it just got really deep  really ugly   Ingmire said   I don t see this ever being fixed   FACEBOOK FIGHTS Many personal conflicts erupt on social media  In the Reuters Ipsos poll  17 percent said they had blocked a family member or close friend on social media because of the election  up 3 percentage points from October   LeShanda Loatman  35  a black Republican real estate agent from Delaware  has severed ties on social media with former co workers and old friends over their support for Trump and their criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement against violence and racism against blacks   I haven t come across anybody who was openly belligerent about the election or Black Lives Matter movement when I was out in public  It s just on Facebook   said Loatman  who voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein  Eventually  McCormick s husband changed his mind about Trump and wrote in former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich in November  but by that time she had decided to strike out on her own  While the couple plans to vacation together and will not get divorced    we re too old for that    she recently settled in her own place in Bellingham  Washington   It really came down to the fact I needed to not be in a position where I had to argue my point of view 24 7  I didn t want to spend the rest of my life doing that   said McCormick  who ultimately cast a write in vote for Democratic U S  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont  In St  Charles  Missouri  retired tour company operator Dennis Conner  who is a Trump supporter  says he has avoided confrontations with his brother  sister in law and brother in law  who were Clinton backers  His advice   We don t have to talk about politics     The Reuters Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states  It has a credibility interval  which is similar to margin of error  of 1 percentage point

122354,343869,MKC,Pressure mounts on Portugal rating  says DBRS,news,"By Marc Jones
LONDON  Reuters    Pressures are building on Portugal s creditworthiness as its low growth economy battles to contain high levels of government and corporate debt and amid banking sector strains  the head of sovereign ratings at credit agency DBRS said 
DBRS s BBB  low  rating has been a vital prop for Portugal  allowing its bonds to remain part of the European Central Bank s 1 7 trillion euro buying program and as eligible collateral for the Bank s unlimited and now free bank funding 
The rating  next due for review on October 21  carries a  stable  outlook  giving Lisbon some breathing space  but Fergus McCormick  NYSE MKC  told Reuters that the picture was deteriorating 
 Friday s Q2 GDP release  which showed growth at just 0 2 percent  raised our concerns about growth prospects  which appear to be slowing into the third quarter   he told Reuters in an interview 
 Therefore  the outlook remains stable  but pressures appear to be mounting from these various fronts   he added  also citing European Commission demands that an unwilling Lisbon implement more spending cuts 
DBRS s October review will come just a week after Portugal is scheduled to provide the Commission with a list of those new cuts to get its budget deficit back under 3 percent of GDP 
Uncertainties over the make up of those measures and their impact on the delicate political balance were a concern McCormick said  as was the possibility that more taxpayer money may be needed to prop up banks including Caixa Geral de Depositos and BCP 
 Will the far left parties support these two initiatives  This is unclear  
DBRS s view is closely watched because it is the only one of the four ratings agencies recognized by the ECB to have an investment grade rank for Portugal 
It needs a rating of that category to qualify for the central bank s quantitative easing program and for the ECB to accept Portugal s bonds as loan collateral 
A downgrade could therefore cause havoc for Portugal s borrowing costs and its banks which rely heavily on the ECB s funding  and analysts warn it would almost inevitably trigger a significant market selloff 
NEXT BIG TEST
For Europe as a whole the next crucial test after the Brexit vote will be an upcoming constitutional referendum in Italy  McCormick said 
DBRS put Italy s A  low  rating on downgrade warning earlier this month  and if the agency pulls the trigger that would also have major ramifications 
Italian government bonds would be hit with as much as an 8 percent bigger  haircut  in ECB lending operations  meaning they would have to find other ways to get the money that some need to stay afloat 
While Italy faces similar problems to Portugal in terms of meager growth  high debt and problem banks  McCormick said Prime Minister Matteo Renzi s decision to call a public referendum on political reform plans was a key trigger for the review 
With the vote set to determine Renzi s political future  it represents  the next big test for the euro zone  
 It is also the next test  following the UK referendum  of popular support for the EU   McCormick said  referring to Britain s vote to leave the European Union in June 
It was likely to result in either greater political stability and better governance  or more uncertainty and lower growth  he added 
And like in Portugal  low growth is already making it harder for Italy s banks to deal with bad loans on their books 
S P s head of sovereign ratings told Reuters last week its BBB  rating on Italy could handle the potential costs of a government bailout but for DBRS s A  low  grade it may not be so digestible 
 If in the future an injection of public money is necessary to support bank balance sheets  this would translate into an increase in government debt  This contingent liability risk is a cause for concern   McCormick said ",2016-08-16,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/pressure-mounts-on-portugal-rating,-says-dbrs-420606",420606
122355,343870,MKC,DBRS cautious over Portugal s CGD recapitalization plans,news," Reuters    Credit rating agency DBRS said on Thursday it was difficult to assess the impact on Portugal s government rating from the plan to recapitalize state owned bank CGD until it was clear whether investors would buy new debt the plan hinges on  DBRS s view is key because its BBB low rating for Portugal is currently the only one high enough to keep Portugal s sovereign bonds in the European Central Bank s 1 5 trillion euro buying programme  
 The finance ministry s proposal to recapitalize CGD is an important demonstration of the effort to clean up the banking system  However     it will be important to gauge the level of investor appetite for the 1 billion euros in subordinated debt that CGD intends to raise  Until we know this  it will be hard to assess the impact on the public sector balance sheet   said the firm s head of sovereign ratings Fergus McCormick  NYSE MKC  ",2016-08-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/dbrs-cautious-over-portugal's-cgd-recapitalization-plans-422389,422389
122356,343871,MKC,U S  futures flat on Deutsche Bank jitters  Fed inflation data on tap,news,"Investing com   Wall Street futures pointed to a flat open on Friday as concerns over Germany s largest lender  Deutsche Bank  kept U S  market participants cautious while they awaited key data including the Federal Reserve s  Fed  favorite inflation indicator  the core personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index 
The blue chip Dow futures slipped 6 points  or 0 03   by 7 01AM ET  11 01GMT   the S P 500 futures inched up less than a point  or 0 01   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 3 points  or 0 07  
Following the path of its U S  listed shares that hit an all time low on Thursday   DE DBKGn  saw its shares further punished on Friday as a Bloomberg that a number of hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche had withdrawn some excess cash and adjusted positions held at the lender added to concerns over the banks health and its possible contagion to other global banks 
The move early Wednesday took European shares of the German bank below  10 for the first time in nearly 30 years  though losses were pared after chief exec John Cryan wrote a memo stating that  market forces  were responsible for the share slide and there was no basis for concern over the bank s health 
Stateside  futures pointed to further caution after the Deutsche Bank story caused a sell off a day earlier as investors awaited a string of data 
In focus  the core PCE price index for August was expected to tick up to 1 7   moving ever closer to the Fed s 2  inflation target  This measure of prices is key to shifts in the Fed s monetary policy 
The data  out at 8 30AM  12 30GMT  will be accompanied by personal income and spending for the same month 
On a lesser scale  attention will also be paid to the Chicago PMI and the revised Michigan consumer sentiment  both for the month of September 
Additionally  Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan will participate in a Q A at 1 00PM ET  17 00GMT  with markets continuing to attempt to decipher the timing of the next U S  rate hike 
Bets had currently shifted to February 2017  with odds for a December hike reduced to 48 8   missing the 50  threshold  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
On the company front  shares in Costco Wholesale Corporation  NASDAQ COST  were expected to open higher after the wholesale club retailer s quarterly profit beat on lower Visa fees 
McCormick   Company Incorporated  NYSE MKC  could also see upside in Friday s session after a 6  rise in sales helped profit beat estimates 
On the downside   CalAmp Corp   NASDAQ CAMP  had tumbled almost 13  in Thursday s after hours session after reporting a steep drop in its fiscal second quarter bottom line 
Meanwhile  oil prices slumped on Friday as investors took profits following a 7  gain in the last two sessions  amid doubts that OPEC s first planned output cut in eight years would make a substantial dent in the global crude glut 
Several analysts had expressed skepticism over the future deal and whether it would have a material impact  Even if the cartel strictly abided by the quotas eventually set  they expressed concern that production elsewhere would ramp up to take advantage of higher profit 
In that light  investors looked ahead to data from oil services provider Baker Hughes  later in the session  Last week  the figures showed that the number of active rigs drilling in the U S  had increased for the twelfth time the last 13 weeks

U S  shares of Deutsche Bank AG NA O N   NYSE DB  were sharply higher on Friday after the rout a day earlier on the back of a Bloomberg report that a number of hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche had withdrawn some excess cash and adjusted positions held at the lender added to concerns over the banks health and its possible contagion to other global banks 
Amid assurances from analysts that a parallel could not be drawn between Germany s biggest lender and Lehman Brother s situation in 2008  because Deutsche not only had sufficient capital but  unlike the American firm  had access to liquidity via the European Central Bank  shares in the financial institution began to recover after its chief exec John Cryan wrote a memo stating that  market forces  were responsible for the share slide and there was no basis for concern over the bank s health 
Later  unconfirmed reports surfaced that the fine on the bank from the Department of Justice could end up being around  5 4 billion  compared to an initial  14 billion  easing concerns 
Meanwhile  data stateside showed that the core PCE price index  the Fed s preferred inflation measure rose at an annualized rate of 1 7  in August  That was in line with forecasts and moved closer to the U S  central bank s 2  inflation target 
But a flat reading on personal spending for the same month  along with a surprise drop in real personal consumption seemed to outweigh any pressure on the Fed to return to policy normalization 
Also on Friday s calendar   manufacturing activity in the Chicago area rose more than expected in September  while production hit its highest level since January 
Furthermore  the Michigan consumer sentiment for September was revised higher than expected

Additionally  volumes decreased 14   Results were marred by softness in branded and fresh exports  Also  the company s Brazilian business delivered a weak performance  Operating profit plunged 29 6

122410,343925,MKC,Special Report  In North Dakota s oil patch  a humbling comedown ,news,"By Ernest Scheyder
WILLISTON  N D   Reuters    Dave Van Assche didn t fret too much when oil prices started to slide in late 2014 
The postal services business he had built over three short years was thriving  catering to the tens of thousands of people who  like him  had streamed into North Dakota to strike it rich during an unprecedented oil boom 
But the price drop quickened  due in part to a supply glut from the 1 2 million barrels of oil North Dakota was pumping each day  Within a year  oil prices were down more than 70 percent  and North Dakota s oil rush stalled  The daily take at Van Assche s business has sunk from a peak of  2 500 to at best  600 now 
Unwilling to lay off his four employees  Van Assche has been taking short term jobs around the country to cover costs  He cleaned corn residue from rail cars in Ohio last month  Up next  cleaning a defunct nuclear power plant in California  Van Assche s wife  finance manager for the business  took a job as a substitute teacher for Williston s public schools 
 My business was decimated   said Van Assche  29 years old  He prays for an oil price jump   but now it s very quiet  
By 2014  the U S  energy boom  supercharged by the revolution in hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  had made North Dakota s economy the fastest growing in the nation  Its unemployment rate was lowest among states  Its gross domestic product of roughly  50 billion that year was more than double 2002 levels 
The pain for much of last year was mitigated as aggressive price hedges and similar maneuvers kept the industry profitable  But those tactics have stopped working  North Dakota s economy shrank 3 4 percent in the third quarter of last year  the weakest performer in the nation  Worse numbers for the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 are expected in a federal report to be released in June 
All facets of the oil boom   including the people  like Van Assche  who supported it   are now in retreat  It s a stunning reversal of fortune for a state whose governor  Jack Dalrymple  vowed in 2014 that he would not blink in the fight with OPEC for global oil market share 
More than 80 000 people poured into North Dakota  looking to stake their future on the fracking economy  The state s Bakken oil patch  centered here in Williston  was a magnet for oil workers  business investors and job hungry folks 
That future has evaporated  Those who haven t packed up and left the Bakken are facing a new reality of smaller budgets  fewer residents and the physical detritus of a building boom that left behind hundreds of empty apartments 
Williston s Walmart  NYSE WMT  has cut hourly pay 15 percent  The Salvation Army  facing slipping donations  reduced gasoline and food assistance by a third  Statewide  oil tax revenue is down nearly 70 percent from this time last year 
 No one has any money to spend here anymore   said an exotic dancer at Williston s Heartbreakers strip club  She estimated that tips had gone down more than 60 percent since last fall 
Until recently  oilfield roughnecks were making more than  100 000 a year on average  Few command those salaries today  Many of those roughnecks used to line up outside Heartbreakers every day for its 4 p m  opening  regardless of the weather  which plumbs 0 F   18 C  in the dark of winter 
It was a tough crowd most nights  Heartbreakers installed metal panels over its windows to deflect stray bullets after one patron fatally shot another in 2013 
If frigid temperatures and the risk of violence couldn t keep them away  the economy can  One recent evening  Heartbreakers attracted only three customers  Since then  the club s owner  Jared Holbrook  has closed Heartbreakers and is planning to reopen the venue in coming days as Williston s first gay bar 
On the plus side  rates of syphilis transmission dropped 16 percent statewide last year from the 2014 peak  state officials said in April 
Williston s 2nd Avenue West  the main thoroughfare nicknamed  Million Dollar Way   is pockmarked with vacant storefronts and empty parking lots  Aaron s Rent To Own  a retailer of televisions and video game consoles  shuttered two months ago  Prices for industrial real estate   warehouses and the like   have dropped nearly 40 percent in the past year 
Many people who remain in the area are adjusting to lower salaries and dwindling career options 
 There s some people coming in who have never visited us before   said Joshua Stansbury  a captain with the Salvation Army s Williston branch   They re a little bit ashamed to now ask for help  
 ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET 
North Dakota has lived through cheap oil before 
Booms and busts in the 1950s and 1980s left many of the state s western communities mired in debt  Williston didn t pay off the millions of dollars it owed from municipal projects of the 1980s oil boom until the early 2000s 
Despite that experience  many welcomed the infusion of capital when Continental Resources Inc  Whiting Petroleum Corp and other oil producers began using horizontal fracking in 2008 and 2009 to tap the 7 4 billion barrels of oil estimated to lie beneath their feet 
New roads  schools  community centers and other public facilities began sprouting up  funded largely by oil tax revenue 
Now  Continental and others have stopped fracking altogether in North Dakota  Statewide  there are only eight crews fracking new wells for the few companies still willing to pay for the service  Two years ago  there were 45  a peak for the teams that pump water  sand and chemicals deep underground to extract oil and natural gas 
 This boom  it s over  at least it feels that way   said Mark Ohl  who lost his job on a drilling rig after Continental canceled its contract   But if you don t know the oil industry is cyclical  you re an idiot  
Ohl now spends days hunting for jobs and drinks Pabst Blue Ribbon beer most nights at Cattails  a Williston dive bar with a deer head and Bud Light beer mirrors pinned to the walls 
The slowdown has also inflicted pain on community budgets  Williston s debt and other liabilities nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2014  to  158 million  as the city sought to keep pace with growth 
Yet the city s sales tax receipts fell 47 percent in March from a year earlier  according to the state treasurer 
Moody s Corp  the credit rating agency  downgraded Williston s general obligation bonds in March to junk status  citing the city s reliance on those sales taxes to repay debt 
 Putting all your eggs in one basket can be very risky  and I think we re seeing that bear out in Williston and North Dakota now   said Hetty Chang  a Moody s analyst 
Statewide  Governor Dalrymple ordered agencies to trim 4 percent from their budgets to offset a  1 billion budget gap  The state will end free vaccines for children as part of the cuts  The University of North Dakota System is laying off more than 130 employees 
The state does have a  3 67 billion Legacy Fund set up as a type of endowment to preserve some oil tax revenue  But the fund s principal and interest can t be touched until 2017 
Tax receipts are down in part because folks like Jon Ritchart are leaving  With his pay cut 30 percent and the bonus eliminated for his job heating water for fracking   a gig that once paid him  130 000 a year   the 60 year old is headed back to Washington state 
 I can feed two people at home for a month for what it costs me to eat in Williston for a week   Ritchart said   I can t afford to stay here   Food and other basic goods remain expensive in the remote region 
As the good times rolled  demographers bullishly predicted Williston s population would hit 50 000 by 2020  Since last summer  Williston s population has shrunk 16 percent to 26 533  according to the city s wastewater data  which planning officials rely on in the absence of more precise U S  Census measurements 
United Airlines ended a direct flight from Williston to global oil hub Houston in early April   Home Depot  Inc  NYSE HD  will close its Williston store this month  FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX   facing a steep drop in mail volumes  runs one daily delivery plane to Williston  down from three a year ago 
FedEx s move is due in part to the drop in business at Van Assche s three postal services shops  They helped the state s new itinerant oilfield workers send and receive packages  print resumes and business cards  and fax loan and rental contracts 
A roadside advertisement for the stores boasted they could ship guns and heavy freight  Today  they sit eerily quiet 
 We re cutting costs in every way  shape and form that we can   Van Assche said   This boom and bust thing has been a lot of fun   he added   but I don t want to live the rest of my life like this  
Four years ago  Marcus Jundt opened the Williston Brewing Company  a once popular lunch spot that now has dozens of empty tables come noon  A popular restaurateur in Texas  Jundt   who has a framed picture of himself with President George W  Bush at the Williston eatery s entrance   thought he could replicate the success in North Dakota 
Revenue at the restaurant  Jundt said  is down 60 percent from a peak in 2013   When the rest of the U S  economy was coming out of the Great Recession  Williston offered people a chance to provide for their families and make a lot of money   Jundt said  While he doesn t expect to close  he has had to lay off staff   It s not the same anymore   he said 
 IT S A RECESSION 
In downtown Williston  near the strip club  a  15 million building with retail  residential and office space opened last March  on St  Patrick s Day  All of the retail spots and more than half of the apartments sit empty 
 It seems like people are on the fence  waiting   said Paul Russo  a vice president at The Renaissance Cos  The developer named the property Renaissance on Main  thinking it would serve as a symbol of western North Dakota s rebirth 
Instead  it has become a monument to the overbuilding that continues in a region quickly losing residents  The 900 apartment units under construction today in Williston will soon join the more than 10 000 already built since the boom began in 2009  according to a study from THK Associates  an architecture firm 
At Prairie Pines  an apartment complex in Williston owned by private equity fund KKR   Co LP  nearly half of the 330 units remain empty even after rates were halved in late 2014 
Advertisements throughout Williston  Watford City and other oil communities offer two or three months of free rent  a far cry from the boom  when rents rivaled those in New York City and San Francisco 
Lacey Blank McCormick  NYSE MKC  moved with her three children into a three bedroom Williston apartment in March  paying  1 500 a month  As recently as January  the same apartment went for  1 800 a month 
 This area is seeing a slowdown  for sure   said McCormick  who sold her engagement ring for  1 250 last month to pay down debt and took a second job at a deli to augment her pay as an administrative assistant at an engineering firm 
Less than a third of Williston s 2 300 hotel rooms are full on any given night  The average hotel nightly rate is  99  down 23 percent from last fall 
Williston s school district is opening a  57 million high school this fall that was built to hold 1 500 students  Officials expect only 1 000 to enroll  the same number as at the existing school building 
Williams County  which includes Williston  still plans to spend  55 million on a new jail and  250 million on a new airport  despite a decrease in crime and 39 percent drop in plane boardings in the past year  Funding will come from cash on hand  loans from the state bank and grants from the federal government 
Politicians have taken to a common refrain that the oil price drop could actually be a good thing for the Bakken region by offering a chance to recover from the excesses of the boom   Williston is still open for business   said Shawn Wenko  head of the Williston Economic Development office  a city agency charged with diversifying the economy 
A few have benefited by sticking it out while others have fled or collapsed   All of our competitors have gone out of business   said Jon Greiner  owner of Basin Safety Consulting  which trains oil companies on safety techniques for handling deadly chemicals   Our existing clients are giving us too much work  
That s an exception  however  Staff at the state agency JobService ND who spent the past five years scrambling to help fill jobs now find themselves busy with unemployment insurance applications  The agency hosted a Williston job fair in early April for 375 jobs  More than 1 250 applicants showed up 
Stephen Hopkins  31  moved to Williston in early 2014 from Wisconsin with  148 in his pocket and  40 000 in debt  He soon landed two jobs   one bartending  the other at a local retailer of oilfield work clothes 
Within 18 months  he had paid off his debt  saved  20 000 and bought a new car  He swore he wouldn t leave Williston without  100 000 in the bank 
Then  last fall  he lost his retail job  Tips at his bartending job dropped more than 40 percent  Hopkins decided to return home with the money he had in the bank 
 Bye Bye  Bakken      he wrote in a late March Facebook  NASDAQ FB  post

include  The Buckle  Inc    NYSE BKE    YETI Holdings  Inc    NYSE YETI    McCormick   Company  Inc    NYSE MKC   and Equity Residential   NYSE EQR   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Millennials to Boost U S  Economy  5 Top PicksMillennials are set to boost America s economy by adding the power of the youth to workforce  As such  millennials form the largest generational cohort of America s workforce  As the labor market remains tight and unemployment is at historic lows  an influx of young workers should boost the overall economy Further  reports suggest that millennials earn high salaries and spend lavishly on consumer goods  travelling and leisure activities  Moreover  better pay checks also lead to spending on fine dining and entertainment  The space will witness a revolution in the days to come as millennials are likely to spend their disposable income on such products and services Under such conditions  investing in stocks from the real estate  consumer discretionary and airline sectors seems prudent  Such sectors are directly impacted by a shift toward leisure spending High Salary and Low Unemployment Driving Millennials  GrowthPer a USA TODAY report  millennials  especially new job entrants  receive pay hikes  which average 6   This is double the wage gains of the entire workforce of America Further  workers in the age group of 20 24 years  having freshly graduated  benefit the most from the fact that America s unemployment rate is at a 50 year low currently  Also  millennials are known to be serious job hoppers  One of the primary reasons why they get paid more is that they start from a lower base and climb by switching jobs  As a result  these new entrants and recent graduates  income is 71 7  of their elders  average pay Are Millennials a Shield to US Recession U S  GDP is staying afloat on high consumer spending  With baby boomers nearing retirement  millennials are pushing the spending charts higher Further  a strong job market and low unemployment rate are creating an environment that is supporting consumers spending power  Let s have a look at the Haver Analytics  Bureau of Labor Statistics and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Wealth Management GIC s report on data on consumption levels by age group and source of spending data between 1984 to 2014 The graph shows maximum consumption between 35 and 54 years and consumption patterns of the millennials and baby boomers  Further  if we can draw a projection  we can say that around 2035 millennials are going to make maximum consumption Coming back to the present day  the Global X Millennials Thematic ETF has risen 25 7  on a year to date basis and 67 6  since its inception in late 2016  The ETF consists of companies that are preferred by the U S  millennials and are boosted by their rising spending power What s more  per a Coldwell Banker study  millennial millionaires make up approximately 2  of the total U S  millionaire population  In fact  millennials may hold five times more wealth compared to what they hold today  Per the study  millennials will inherit over  68 trillion from their baby boomer parents by the year 2030 Top 5 Picks As America s workforce remains relatively young compared to the other major economies of the world  the country stands to gain  A healthy increase in millennials  paychecks has led to higher consumer spending and a bump in stocks of companies operating in food and beverage  apparels  entertainment and fintech sectors Given such positives we have shortlisted five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

 NEW YORK  March 29  Reuters    U S  stock index futures
were flat on Tuesday near the quarter s end as investors took a
wait and see stance  unsure about the impact of global crises 
 In one sign of the spillover from overseas events 
oilfield services company Halliburton Co said its quarterly
earnings were hurt in part by turmoil in oil producing
regions 
 The S P 500 index is up 4 2 percent in the quarter  and in
the absence of further clarity on such issues as Japan s
nuclear power problems and the civil unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa  many investors are choosing not to risk their
gains  The trading volume in Monday s session was the lowest of
the year 
  Despite the significant events in the Middle East and
Japan  the market has help up very well  so many portfolio
managers are staying pat as the quarter ends   said Oliver
Pursche  president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in
Suffern  New York   Until we get a better handle on those
issues  there s no overwhelming reason to become more
invested  
 Late Monday  Halliburton  said it would cut its
first quarter earnings because of the unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa and weather related events in North America
and Australia  The stock slid 1 percent to  47 40 in light
premarket trading  For details  see  ID nN2852973 
 Pursche said that while other oil related stocks could face
similar issues  he didn t expect the overseas events to impact
results in the upcoming earnings season 
 Lennar Corp  rose 2 3 percent to  20 20 before the
bell after the homebuilder swung to profit in the first
quarter   ID nL3E7ET1SX 
 Dow component Home Depot Inc  late Monday said it
would buy back  1 billion of outstanding shares through an

 NEW YORK  Sept 28  Reuters    U S  stock index futures rose
on Wednesday  indicating stocks will climb for a fourth
straight session as investors remained encouraged by progress
toward plans to ease the euro zone s debt woes 
 International auditors headed to Greece to scrutinize new
austerity measures they must endorse for Athens to get their
next tranche of aid 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that parts of a
planned new 109 billion euro   148 6 billion  rescue for the
debt laden country could be reopened  depending on the outcome
of the audit  For details  see  ID nL5E7KR3D4 
 Recent efforts to solidify a euro zone rescue fund and
alleviate the region s sovereign debt crisis lifted stocks on
Tuesday for a third consecutive session and came after four
straight days of losses for the benchmark S P 500 
  The market is obviously enthusiastic about some of the
measures and actions being taken to stave off a contagion in
the euro debt situation   said Andre Bakhos  director of market
analytics at Lek Securities in New York 
  While the bulls are excited about this in pricing to
perfection a successful execution of whatever plan there is 
the downside risk is great and volatility is here to stay  
 Market volatility could remain as traders react to European
headlines and attempt to gauge the commitment of governments
and institutions as they work to prevent a Greek default 
 Analysts also said equities would be supported by
quarter end  window dressing   when portfolio managers drop
underperforming stocks and buy outperformers 
 S P 500 futures  rose 6 5 points and were above fair
value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates  dividends and time to expiration of the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures  gained 64
points  and Nasdaq 100 futures  added 14 points 
 Investors will also eye data on August durable goods orders
from the Commerce Department  due at 8 30 a m  EDT   1230 GMT 
Economists in a Thomson Reuters survey expected orders to be
unchanged in August versus a 4 1 percent rise in July

connection between the Comcast IP address and the hacker  In fact  the IP address was not the one from which the data breach was launched  However  U S  Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that the information sought by Uber in a subpoena of Comcast records was  reasonably likely  to help reveal the  bad actor  responsible for the hack   On Monday  Lyft spokesman Brandon McCormick  NYSE MKC  said the company had investigated the matter  long ago  and concluded  there is no evidence that any Lyft employee  including Chris  downloaded the Uber driver information or database  or had anything to do with Uber s May 2014 data breach   McCormick declined to comment on whether the Comcast IP address belongs to Lambert  He also declined to describe the scope of Lyft s internal investigation or say who directed it   Lambert declined to comment in person or over email  Attorneys for the Comcast subscriber  who is not named in court documents  did not respond to an interview request on Monday  In an email on Monday  an Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on any aspect of the case beyond what is in court filings  including what led the company to believe that more information about the Comcast subscriber might lead them to the hacker   Uber s lawsuit alleges the hacker violated civil provisions of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  as well as a similar California law  It is unclear if the leaked driver information was ever used by the hacker or anyone else  According to documents filed in the case  the company learned months after the hack that someone had used an Uber digital security key to access the driver database  A copy of the key was inadvertently posted by Uber on one of its public pages on the code development platform GitHub in March of 2014  prior to the breach  the court filings show  and remained there for months  After Uber discovered the unauthorized download  it examined the Internet Protocol addresses of every visitor to the page during the time between when the key was posted and when the breach occurred  according to court documents  The Uber review concluded that  the Comcast IP address is the only IP address that accessed the GitHub post that Uber has not eliminated  from suspicion  court papers say   The numeric Comcast IP address and some other details have been redacted from court filings  so Reuters was unable to independently assess whether there was a connection between Lambert and the Comcast IP address  The two sources  however  said Uber researched the address and discovered that it showed up elsewhere in Internet postings associated with Lambert  and that the address was assigned to his name   Lawyers for the unnamed Comcast subscriber have pointed out in court that the web page containing the key was publicly available and that anyone could have visited the site without violating any laws  They also stressed that the data breach stemmed from a different IP address   In his statement on Monday  Lyft spokesman McCormick noted that  Uber allowed login credentials for their driver database to be publicly accessible for months before and after the breach   The two sources said that the address from which the hack was launched is associated with a virtual private network service  One of them added that the service is based in a Scandinavian country and is known for vigorously protecting the privacy of its users  The hacker s numeric IP address is redacted from court papers   In July  the federal magistrate judge in San Francisco approved Uber s request for a subpoena granting the company access to the Comcast subscriber s identity  source of payment and other subscription details  The subpoena also requires Comcast to disclose information connecting the subscriber to certain other IP addresses and to the GitHub web pages  Attorneys for the unnamed Comcast subscriber appealed to the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals  and Beeler put her ruling on hold pending the outcome  In fighting the subpoena  the subscriber s attorneys asserted in court that Uber has improperly focused on their client instead of other possible perpetrators of the breach  They noted that automated web crawlers also visited the site with the security key  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and other search engines use such crawlers to visit and gather information from web pages for indexing and caching  One of those crawlers could have saved the key somewhere else  the subscriber s attorneys argued in court filings  where it could have been accessed by the hacker   The attorneys also suggested that a disgruntled Uber engineer could have taken the driver data to a new job  as it would be valuable for a competitor  In her ruling  Beeler concluded there was  no evidence  that the key was available anywhere else online other than the place Uber inadvertently posted it  Lyft  with a valuation of  2 5 billion  is much smaller than rival Uber  valued at  51 billion  based on previous funding rounds  The companies compete fiercely for drivers and customers

122445,343960,MKC,Archer Daniels  ADM  Q3 Earnings   Sales Beat Estimates,opinion,Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   has reported better than expected earnings and sales numbers in third quarter 2019  Moreover  the top line improved on a year over year basis Quarterly results benefited from the company s consistent efforts amid a tough external environment and a weak ethanol industry  Going forward  management remains optimistic about Archer Daniels  leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets  nutrition and sustainable materials  Moreover  the company remains focused on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently and aid overall growth Q3 in DetailAdjusted earnings of 77 cents per share declined 16 3  from the year ago quarter but outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents  On a reported basis  the company s earnings were 72 cents per share  down 23 4  from the prior year quarter Archer Daniels Midland Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Revenues in the quarter under review totaled  16 726 million  which grew 5 9  year over year and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  16 026 million  Increased revenues across all the segments of the company were the primary reason behind the impressive top line results Effective third quarter 2019  Archer Daniels merged its Origination and Oilseeds segments into a single business   Ag Services   Oilseeds  This action was taken to offset the impacts of adverse weather conditions in the first six months of 2019 Going by segments  quarterly revenues at the Ag Services   Oilseeds  Carbohydrate Solutions  Nutrition  and Other grew 2 9   1 2   58  and 4 8   respectively  to  12 616 million   2 565 million   1 457 million  and  88 million Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of  764 million in third quarter 2019  down 11 3  from the year ago quarter  On a GAAP basis  the company s segment operating profit fell nearly 14  year over year to  758 million On a segmental adjusted basis  adjusted operating profit at the Ag Services   Oilseeds segment declined 12 8  year over year to  417 million  Moreover  Ag Services  results remained flat with the year ago quarter  In South America  results benefited from improved origination margins in Brazil and higher export volume from Argentina  In North America  the company witnessed improved merchandising results  backed by favorable ownership positions  which compensated a tough volume and margin backdrop for U S  exports Moreover  Crushing s results were lower from the year ago period  driven by weak crush margins globally  In South America  continued exports of soybeans to China hurt margins  However  crush margins remained impressive in North America and EMEA  Global crush margins somewhat benefited from favorable net timing effects of roughly  50 million during the reported quarter  Furthermore  Refined Products and Other s results were considerably higher than the year ago quarter  primarily fueled by improvements in Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts  The segment s results were hurt by lower Wilmar results The Carbohydrate Solutions segment s adjusted operating profit plunged 36 8  to  182 million  The downside can mainly be attributed to weak Bioproducts results due to negative ethanol industry margins  Starches and Sweeteners were also down  Moreover  results in North America were hurt by increased net corn expenses  somewhat mitigated with lower manufacturing costs   including improvements at the Decatur corn facility  Further  results in EMEA were marred by lower selling prices along with pressures from Turkish sweetener quotas  In wheat milling  higher sales volume was more than offset by weak margins  driven by lower opportunities in wheat procurement At the Nutrition segment  adjusted operating profit of  118 million improved substantially from  67 million  owing to impressive performance at both WFSI and Animal Nutrition  While increased sales and margins globally aided results for WILD  continued expansion in protein business fueled results at Specialty Ingredients  Further  contributions from investments in bioactives and fibers aided the Health   Wellness business  In Animal Nutrition  results were primarily backed by contributions from the Neovia buyout  Improvements in vitamin additives coupled with increased lysine production  despite adverse impact of pricing  further drove results Other FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with cash

revenues not only outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also improved year over year  With this  the company delivered the fifth straight positive earnings surprise Quarterly results were fueled by higher revenues  owing to solid shipment and depletions  Notably  robust shipment growth due to the company s efforts to ensure that distributors  inventory levels were appropriate to cater to increased customer demand aided results  Further  strong depletions were supported by continued strength in Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands  Driven by the positive trends  management raised

 the bottom line rose 11 5  from  3 21 earned in the year ago period  backed by robust revenue growth  The upside was partly negated by lower gross margin coupled with higher advertising  promotional

million  Including excise taxes  the top line rose 23 2  year over year to  402 7 million Robust top line performance can primarily be attributed to a 19 1  improvement in shipments to nearly 1 6 million barrels  In fact  distributor inventory as of Sep 28  2019  averaged roughly 3 weeks on hand  Management projects wholesaler inventory levels between 2 and 4 weeks on hand through the rest of 2019 In the quarter under review  depletions grew 30   marking the sixth straight quarter of double digit growth  Depletion growth can be attributed to major innovations  quality of products and strong brands alongside solid sales execution and support from distributors  Further  increases in Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands as well as the inclusion of Dogfish Head brands aided growth  Depletion growth was partly offset by the fall in Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands Depletions for the year to date period through the 42 weeks ended Oct 19  2019  are anticipated to have grown nearly 21  from the year ago period  Excluding Dogfish Head Brewery  depletions grew 19  Costs   MarginsGross profit improved about 19 5  year over year to  187 8 million  However  gross margin contracted 160 basis points to 49 6  due to elevated processing costs  stemming from higher production at third party breweries and increased temporary labor requirements at company owned breweries  These factors were partly negated by higher prices and cost savings at company owned breweries Furthermore  advertising  promotional and selling expenses rose nearly 10  to  96 6 million  Higher spending on media and production  and local marketing as well as the inclusion of Dogfish Head brand related expenses  beginning Jul 3  led to the increase General and administrative expenses totaled  31 4 million  up 38 3  from the year ago quarter  This increase was mainly driven by non recurring Dogfish Head Transaction costs  and the addition of Dogfish Head s general and administrative expenses FinancialsAs of Sep 28  2019  Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of  27 1 million  and total stockholders  equity of nearly  719 million  Moreover  it had no amounts outstanding on its line of credit During the first nine months  and the period between Sep 29  2019 and Oct 26  2019  Boston Beer did not repurchase shares  As a result  the company had nearly  90 3 million remaining under the  931 million share buyback authorization OutlookManagement updated guidance for 2019  Boston Beer now estimates shipment and depletion growth of 19 22  compared with 17 22  mentioned earlier  Excluding Dogfish Head Brewery  shipment and depletion growth is expected to be 15 18   National price increases are still estimated between 1  and 3  Moreover  the company has been witnessing higher costs due to the use of third party breweries and a higher proportion of various packs in its entire product mix  These are likely to hurt gross margin  which is still anticipated to be 50 51   Investment in advertising  promotional and selling expenses is now envisioned to increase  40  50 million  up from  35  45 million stated earlier  The increase mainly stemmed from higher spending on Truly brand  excluding any change in freight expenses For 2019  the adjusted effective tax rate is estimated to be roughly 27   The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share of  8 70  9 30 compared with  8 30  9 30 mentioned earlier  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is currently pegged at  9 13  Furthermore  it now expects capital spending of  100  110 million compared with  120

 BANGALORE  March 29  Reuters    McCormick   Co beat
profit estimates for the fifth straight quarter  as the top U S 
spicemaker raised prices to offset high raw material and
packaging costs  and saw strong demand in Asia and in its
domestic market 	
 Sparks  Maryland based McCormick  which began operations in
1889 in Baltimore  sells spices  herbs  seasoning blends and
sauces to grocers  warehouse clubs and discount and drug stores 	
 For December February  the company earned  76 8 million  or
57 cents a share  above Wall Street expectations of 54 cents a
share  	
 Sales rose more than 2 percent to  782 8 million  but fell
short of estimates as consumer sales in Europe were weak and
higher prices made some shoppers buy less 	
  The biggest challenge we face heading into 2011 is the
unprecedented increase in the cost of spices and herbs  along
with higher costs for commodities such as wheat and soybean oil 
and increases in plastics  another packaging materials   Chief
Executive Alan Wilson said on a conference call with analysts 	
 The CEO said most of the price rises and related challenges
had been dealt with  and the company expects its domestic
consumer business to be stronger as the year proceeds 	
 Sales at its consumer division  which are usually sales
through retailers  rose 3 percent in Americas and 11 percent in
the Asia Pacific  but fell 10 percent in Europe and the Middle
East 	
 McCormick  which sells its products under the Lawry s and
Old Bay labels besides its namesake brand  backed its 2011
earnings outlook of  2 80  2 85 a share and sales growth of 5 7
percent 	
 Shares of the company were down 1 percent at  49 on Tuesday
morning on the New York Stock Exchange

122507,344022,MKC,McCormick  MKC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects McCormick  MKC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 34 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick 
For McCormick  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McCormick will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 16  delivering a surprise of  6 42  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

McCormick shares have added about 12 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 7  
What s Next for McCormick 
While McCormick has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for McCormick was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

122511,344026,MKC,McCormick  MKC  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends McCormick  MKC  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this spices and seasonings company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for McCormick is 11 1   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for McCormick is 17 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 3 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for McCormick  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 9  over the past month 
Bottom Line
McCormick has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

122561,344076,MKC,Trade War Fears Rattle Wall Street  5 Ultra Safe Buys,opinion,President Trump s latest move to levy new tariffs on Chinese imports has made possibilities of a solution to the trade dispute bleak  On the contrary  the latest tariffs have rattled financial markets  with escalating trade tensions killing investors  risk appetite Given the turmoil  investing in low beta defensive companies seems to be the safest option  Such stocks provide risk adjusted returns and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market Trump Announces Tariffs on Chinese GoodsTrump  recently  in a series of tweets said that the United States would impose 10  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese products starting Sep 1  Investors for quite some time have been relaxed about U S  China s trade front  But now  such tweets have unnerved investors with the Dow closing about 281 points down in the last trading session Thanks to Friday s decline  the blue chip index extended its losing streak to four straight sessions  In fact  the broader S P 500 and the tech heavy Nasdaq declined every day in the past week  However  it was not just the stock market that had to bear the brunt  Commodities market also took a beating  with U S  crude oil benchmark tanking nearly 7  last Thursday  After all  higher tariffs no doubt erode profit margins and affect the overall economy But why has Trump issued the latest round of tariffs  The President aims to extract trade concessions from China on an array issues  including intellectual property theft and currency manipulation  Second  let s admit that he wants the Fed to adopt an even more aggressive monetary policy easing stance in the upcoming September FOMC meeting  And with the stock market getting erratic  there is a fair chance that the Fed will cut rates further in the next meeting  Lest we forget  last month Fed trimmed rates by a quarter percentage point citing concerns about global economic growth due to trade war issues Beijing  on the other hand  is possibly looking to defer a trade deal decision until the U S  presidential election next year  Needless to say  China can easily become more hardline as its economy is predominantly dependent on expansion in domestic demand rather than exports  Trump s announcements  thus  will have a modest impact on their growth  reducing their pace of expansion by a meager 0 1   per the consultancy Oxford Economics Unfortunately  the same cannot be said about American companies  Trade sensitive sectors have been affected the most  They say that the cost of critical supplies needed to make products might jump in the near term  Consumer discretionary players were the worst performers among the S P 500 stocks in the past week  sliding 4 4   while the tech bigwigs were not far behind  down 4 3    Source   Multinationals  in particular  are worried about their future ability to trade in China as it is a massive market for them 5 Ultra Safe Stocks to Buy NowAs the markets are plagued with trade related uncertainty  defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option  Such stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the broader market  Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity  gas and water are essentials  Food  beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations Further  only low beta stocks from such defensive companies have been selected  After all  low beta stocks are the ones that are less correlated to the index and tend to be less volatile  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 We have selected five such stocks that hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Southwest Gas Holdings  Inc    NYSE

122562,344077,MKC,GIS Vs  MKC  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Food   Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both General Mills  NYSE GIS  and McCormick  MKC   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Both General Mills and McCormick have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
GIS currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 68  while MKC has a forward P E of 29 17  We also note that GIS has a PEG ratio of 2 24  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MKC currently has a PEG ratio of 3 65

122567,344082,MKC,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Southwest Gas  Alliant Energy  Unitil  Helen Of Troy And McCormick,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  August 6  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Southwest Gas Holdings  Inc    NYSE SWX    Alliant Energy Corporation   NASDAQ LNT    Unitil Corporation   NYSE UTL    Helen of Troy Limited   NASDAQ HELE   and McCormick   Company  Incorporated   NYSE MKC   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Trade War Fears Rattle Wall Street  5 Ultra Safe BuysPresident Trump s latest move to levy new tariffs on Chinese imports has made possibilities of a solution to the trade dispute bleak  On the contrary  the latest tariffs have rattled financial markets  with escalating trade tensions killing investors  risk appetite Given the turmoil  investing in low beta defensive companies seems to be the safest option  Such stocks provide risk adjusted returns and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market Trump Announces Tariffs on Chinese GoodsTrump  recently  in a series of tweets said that the United States would impose 10  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese products starting Sep 1  Investors for quite some time have been relaxed about U S  China s trade front  But now  such tweets have unnerved investors with the Dow closing about 281 points down in the last trading session Thanks to Friday s decline  the blue chip index extended its losing streak to four straight sessions  In fact  the broader S P 500 and the tech heavy Nasdaq declined every day in the past week  However  it was not just the stock market that had to bear the brunt  Commodities market also took a beating  with U S  crude oil benchmark tanking nearly 7  last Thursday  After all  higher tariffs no doubt erode profit margins and affect the overall economy But why has Trump issued the latest round of tariffs  The President aims to extract trade concessions from China on an array issues  including intellectual property theft and currency manipulation  Second  let s admit that he wants the Fed to adopt an even more aggressive monetary policy easing stance in the upcoming September FOMC meeting  And with the stock market getting erratic  there is a fair chance that the Fed will cut rates further in the next meeting  Lest we forget  last month Fed trimmed rates by a quarter percentage point citing concerns about global economic growth due to trade war issues Beijing  on the other hand  is possibly looking to defer a trade deal decision until the U S  presidential election next year  Needless to say  China can easily become more hardline as its economy is predominantly dependent on expansion in domestic demand rather than exports  Trump s announcements  thus  will have a modest impact on their growth  reducing their pace of expansion by a meager 0 1   per the consultancy Oxford Economics Unfortunately  the same cannot be said about American companies  Trade sensitive sectors have been affected the most  They say that the cost of critical supplies needed to make products might jump in the near term  Consumer discretionary players were the worst performers among the S P 500 stocks in the past week  sliding 4 4   while the tech bigwigs were not far behind  down 4 3  Multinationals  in particular  are worried about their future ability to trade in China as it is a massive market for them 5 Ultra Safe Stocks to Buy NowAs the markets are plagued with trade related uncertainty  defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option  Such stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the broader market  Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity  gas and water are essentials  Food  beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations Further  only low beta stocks from such defensive companies have been selected  After all  low beta stocks are the ones that are less correlated to the index and tend to be less volatile  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 We have selected five such stocks that hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or

Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales lagged the same  Both the metrics declined on a year over year basis Quarterly results were hurt by adverse foreign currency translations and a decline in overall core sales  This  coupled with a decline in sales across the Food   Appliances and Home   Outdoor Living segments further weighed on the company s top line performance  Nevertheless  management raised

  which were more than offset by unfavorable currency  Core sales growth was backed by improvement at the Baby and Writing divisions The Food   Appliances segment s  Appliances   Cookware Food  net sales fell 9 4  to  562 million  This downturn can be attributed to negative currency translations and a 7 1  decline in core sales  Notably  decrease in core sales can be mainly attributed to a timing shift in orders from the second quarter to the first quarter with respect to SAP implementation in Fresh Preserving  and persistent challenges in the Appliances business Net sales at the Home   Outdoor Living segment  Outdoor   Recreation  Home Fragrance and Connected Home   Security  totaled  705 million  down nearly 5  from the prior year period  The segment s top line was hurt by

quarterly earnings of 46 cents a share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents but fell 8  from the year ago period  This was owing to higher effective tax rate  exercise of a considerable number of expiring pre IPO stock options and the impact of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard  Definitely  higher cost of sales and increased SG A expenses also acted as deterrents  We note that even higher net sales and lower shares outstanding failed to act as a savior Net sales came in at  1 413 9 million  up 10  from the prior year quarter on account of comparable store sales

basis points to 34 3  owing to cost inflation as well as changes in product mix   Management envisions full year gross margin to be marginally down year over year on account of first quarter results

122721,344236,MKC,Here s Why McCormick  MKC  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at McCormick  MKC   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  McCormick currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MKC that show why this spices and seasonings company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For MKC  shares are up 0 34  over the past week while the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 07  compares favorably with the industry s 2 35  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of McCormick have increased 25 29  over the past quarter  and have gained 47 12  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 10 94  and 11 04   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to MKC s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  MKC is currently averaging 1 112 430 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with MKC 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost MKC s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 25 to  5 27 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line

122746,344261,MKC,McCormick  MKC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"McCormick  MKC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 23 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 45  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick 
For McCormick  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 06  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that McCormick will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of  1 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 67  delivering a surprise of  1 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
McCormick appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mccormick-mkc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200399050,200399050

McCormick shares have added about 3 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 11 6  
What s Next for McCormick 
While McCormick has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

122771,344286,MKC, Dean Foods Slumps 56  In A Year  What Makes It Unappetizing ,opinion,Dean Foods Company   NYSE DF   is in troubled waters  with its stock having crashed 56 3  in a year compared with the  s decline of 59 1   This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company has been battling input cost inflation and soft volumes  keeping investors on the sidelines for a while Dean Foods is making solid efforts to enhance productivity and curtail costs  Let s see if the huge boulders can be offset in the near term Will Dean Foods Remain Under Pressure Dean Foods is battling significant input cost inflation  Evidently  increased resin  freight and fuel expenses have been hurting the company s margins for a while and also remained a worry in the third quarter of 2018  Also  a tight labor market due to limited driver availability impacted margins  These factors along with higher transitory costs related to plant closures and increased advertising expenses weighed on results  Markedly  adjusted gross margin contracted 250 basis points and the company posted an adjusted operating loss of  20 million  Management stated that fuel rates flared up 25  year to date  and is expected to remain high through the final quarter Further  Dean Foods has been grappling with lower volumes and loss of shares in U S  fluid milk volumes for a while now  During the third quarter  volumes declined significantly year over year  mainly due to the closure of seven plants  Further  per USDA results  fluid milk category dropped 2  through August on a quarter to date basis  In fact  soft volumes and escalated transitory costs also dented Dean Foods  adjusted gross profit and bottom line  We expect the impact of these volume losses to linger in the fourth quarter These factors  among others  have been weighing on the company s performance  Incidentally  Dean Foods has been posting year over year decline in the bottom line for two straight quarters  including the third quarter of 2018  wherein adjusted loss of 28 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents  Also  the bottom line compared unfavorably with earnings of 20 cents in the year ago quarter  This was mainly due to volume loss stemming from the closure of seven plants in the quarter and the associated transition costs  Continued decline in fluid milk consumption and inflationary trends across fuel  resin and freight costs were also deterrents  Moreover  a tight labor market affected performance Nevertheless  Dean Foods is on track to boost operational excellence via execution of the enterprise wide cost productivity program in order to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond  This productivity program mainly revolves around enhancement of its supply chain network  optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses  Dean Foods is further implementing plans to alleviate headwinds related to high freight and fuel expenses  while continuing to boost its brands and private label business to fuel volumes Notably  the cost productivity program is likely to deliver an incremental annual run rate savings of  150 million by 2020  These initiatives should help the company offset some negative impacts from volume declines and higher non dairy input costs  Also  the company is focused on reducing unnecessary costs throughout the organization and improving efficiency  Under the OPEX 2020 cost productivity plan introduced in 2017  the company had targeted annual productivity of  80  100 million  These savings are likely to provide some cushion from input cost inflation and volume deleverage throughout its operational phase Although management is committed toward productivity initiatives and cost reductions  these efforts are likely to take time to completely offset the hurdles  This is also reflected in the company s lowered outlook for 2018  Unfortunately  management curtailed its 2018 earnings outlook  when it reported third quarter results  The company now envisions 2018 bottom line to range between a loss of 10 cents and 30 cents per share compared with the previous view of earnings of 32 52 cents Don t Miss These Solid Consumer Staple StocksMcCormick   Company  Incorporated   NYSE MKC   has long term earnings per

   Factors Affecting the StockFlowers Foods has been battling high costs for quite some time now  The company has been witnessing increased materials  supplies  labour and other production costs  excluding depreciation and amortization  for four straight quarters  In the third quarter of 2018  this metric as a percentage of sales expanded 150 bps to 52 6   This increase can be primarily attributed to elevated commodity costs  lower production volumes  greater outside product purchases owing to robust demand for DKB breakfast items and lower manufacturing efficiencies  Persistence of these headwinds may hurt the company s profitability in the upcoming quarterly release  Moreover  the company is grappling with soft EBITDA for the past four quarters  Also  Flowers Foods continued to be negatively impacted by disruptions associated with the inferior yeast  Incidentally  the company encountered operational hurdles at many bakeries during the third quarter  owing to substandard yeast received from a supplier  These factors also weighed on gross margin in the reported quarter  which declined 4 1  from the year ago quarter  Such downsides prompted management to lower its adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2018  raising concerns for the quarter to be reported Nevertheless  Flowers Foods is progressing well with Project Centennial  The plan is aimed at streamlining operations  lowering expenditures  fuelling efficiencies and making prudent investments to solidify Flowers Foods  competitive position and aid revenue growth  Markedly  management expects gross savings of  38  48 million in 2018 from this plan  which should provide some cushion to the stock in the quarter under review Apart from this  the company is focused on acquisitions to strengthen its product portfolio and expand in untapped markets  In this regard  Flowers Foods recently acquired Canyon Bakehouse  which is a privately held  gluten free baking company  This buyout will help Flowers Foods foray into the growing gluten free bakery space  These efforts are likely to continue enhancing the company s portfolio  which  in turn  will help it gain market share   Also  strength in DKB  Nature s Own and Wonder brands drove Flowers  Foods  market share in the third quarter of 2018  which marked the company s ninth consecutive quarter of market share improvement  Continued gains from these businesses bode well for Flowers Foods  What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show that Flowers Foods is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  the stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Though Flowers Foods has a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat Nomad Foods Limited   NYSE NOMD    a Zacks  2 Ranked company  has an Earnings ESP of  1 45   You can see  McCormick   Company   NYSE MKC   has an Earnings ESP of  1 70  and a Zacks Rank of 3 Post Holdings   NYSE POST   has an Earnings ESP of  2 00  and a Zacks Rank of 3 Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In addition to the stocks discussed above  wouldn t you like to know about our 10 finest buy and holds for the year From more than 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market  Even during 2018 while the market dropped  5 2   our Top 10s were up well into double digits  And during bullish 2012   2017  they soared far above the market s  126 3   reaching  181 9  This year  the portfolio features a player that thrives on volatility  an AI comer  and a dynamic tech company that helps doctors deliver better patient outcomes at lower costs ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-high-costs-hinder-flowers-foods-flo-q4-earnings-200381340,200381340
122812,344327,MKC,McCormick  MKC  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"McCormick  MKC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 55 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick 
For McCormick  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McCormick will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of  1 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 28  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
McCormick doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mccormick-mkc-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200376687,200376687

the Zacks Consensus Estimate and sales surpassing the same  This marks the fourth straight sales beat for the company in a row  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s top line performance mainly gained from a solid core business However  bottom line declined year on year due to sluggishness in the Health   Home segment  We note that this segment was negatively impacted by decelerated China e commerce growth  Going ahead  management expects trade tensions between China and United States to continue weighing down the unit s performance  This combined with adverse impacts of pricing actions compelled management to trim the upper end of the sales view for fiscal 2019 Such headwinds dented investors  optimism  evident from the stock s 12 8  decline in yesterday s trading session  We note that shares of the company have declined 2 9  in the past three months compared with the  s decline of 3 1   Results in DetailAdjusted earnings from continuing operations fell 4  year over year to  2 40 per share  The downside stemmed from lower operating income in the Health   Home segment  This was partially offset by improved operating income in the Houseware unit  reduced interest and tax expenses as well as lower outstanding shares  We note that bottom line results in the quarter were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate Net sales advanced 2 4  to  431 1 million  beating the consensus mark of  420 2 million  Top line growth was mainly supported by a 2 9  rise in the company s core business  courtesy of strong brick and mortar sales in the Housewares segment and growth in online sales  Further  the company s Leadership Brands continued to depict sturdy performance and rose nearly 4 9  in the reported quarter   These were partly offset by softness in the personal care

Consolidated gross margin slipped 0 1 percentage points  or 10 basis points  to 42 2   due to adverse product mix and rise in tariffs  These were partly made up by margin improvements from strength in

compensation and product claims Adjusted operating income declined 8 9  to  70 6 million  while adjusted operating margin declined 200 basis points  bps  due to higher tariffs  advertising costs  freight expenses and share based compensation expenses  These were somewhat countered by strength in Leadership Brands as well as favorable impacts of currency rates and forward contract settlements Segment PerformanceHousewares net sales increased 11 4   courtesy of solid online sales  product launches as well as higher points of sales and increased distribution with domestic brick and mortar customers  However  these positives were somewhat offset by reduced club channel sales and lower inventory from a key online retailer Adjusted operating income improved 2 7  to  32 6 million  while adjusted operating margin declined 190 bps to 22 8  Net sales in the Health   Home segment declined 0 7  due to adverse currency fluctuations and decline in the unit s core business  Sluggish core business performance stemmed from weak online sales and adverse impacts from international distribution  Performance of the segment was also hurt by decelerated China e commerce growth  Such downsides were partially made offset by increased seasonal growth as well as enhanced distributions and shelf space gains related to existing customers Adjusted operating income declined roughly 23 7  to  24 5 million  while adjusted operating margin contracted 400 bps to 13  Beauty sales dropped 3   thanks to persistent weakness across brick and mortar channels  decline in personal care business and the

continues to expect annualized profit growth of nearly  8  10 million from this program Fiscal 2019 OutlookManagement is impressed with sturdy growth in Leadership Brands  strong online sales and advancements in the Housewares segment  However  sluggishness in the Beauty segment and a volatile trading environment between China and United States are worries   That said  management revised sales outlook for fiscal 2019  Consolidated net sales are now projected in the band of  1 535  1 550 billion compared with the earlier projection of  1 535  1 560 billion  The narrowed upper end of the sales view takes into consideration the adverse impacts stemming from pricing actions and decelerated growth in China s e commerce arising out of higher inventory levels in a product category  These headwinds are most to impact performance of the Health   Home segment  Moreover  management believes that the ongoing trade tensions are having an adverse impact on both domestic and Chinese consumers Additionally  the revised top line view considers the adoption of ASU 2014 09  Revenue Recognition Standard   Also  net sales guidance includes expected unfavorable impact of nearly 1 1  from the severity of the cold cough flu season Further  sales in the Housewares segment are anticipated to grow 11 13  compared with the previous forecast of increase in the band of 9 11   Health   Home sales

S P 500 Futures  Never Seen So Many Directional Changes

Yesterday started with both Asia and Europe trading lower overnight  and the S P 500 futures  looked  like they were going up on Globex  but that didn t last  After printing a new June low in the overnight session  the ESU opened the cash hours at 2701 75  down  4 00 handles  The futures rose to 2707 25 early before a heavy wave of selling pushed the index down to 2694 25  From there  buyers took it up to 2706 75 just after 9 00 before another wave of selling took the ES to a new low by three ticks at 2693 75 
When the ES failed to hold a new low  buy programs help push the index higher throughout the morning as it broke new highs into the Euro close  printing 2714 00 after 10 30 am cst  After the stop run the NQ lost momentum and the ES sold back off down to 2700 25 before rallying up to 2713 50  After a few small pullbacks the ES traded all the way up to 2726 25 at 2 24 as the MiM started to show Over  300 million to buy  and then sold off down to 2719 25  On the 2 45 cash imbalance reveal the ES traded 2719 00 as the final MiM showed small to buy  On the 3 00 cash close the ES traded 2717 50  and then went on to settle at 2719 25 on the 3 15 futures close  up  14 25 handles or  0 53  on the day 
In the end  the markets did exactly what I thought they would do  they had a short squeeze  I told people in the MTS forum and Twitter that people were too short and that there we buy stops to run  and the ES cooporated perfectly  In terms of the ES s overall trade  all the the early whiplash and rips pushed the volume up to 1 Million  In terms of the overall tone  I think the rally was more about squeezing some shorts out than new buying

As June and Q2 come to a close stocks are trying to mount a rally and July is the best month of the third quarter  It remains to be seen if NASDAQ s perennial mid year rally can materialize and lift all stocks  But if it does it will provide ample opportunity to unload underperforming and unwanted positions and firm up your summer portfolio defense 
You can see in the updated chart below of the S P 500 4 Year Cycle Seasonal Patterns that the blue chip index failed at resistance  red dotted line  and did not clear the March highs  Aside from the new Defensive Stock Basket we are solidly in risk off mode  The Best Months are over  summer is worse in midterm years and the rhetoric and developments in the geopolitical arena are conspiring to spook the market 

GE s boot from the Dow doesn t seem to be helping matters either  And as we enter deeper into the bearish season several matters could jolt market  Trump s scheduled t te   t te with Putin and the ongoing trade and tariff battles are bound to give markets a scare  Then there is the pressure of rising oil prices and the sudden bout of cold feet we are hearing from the Fed as inflation begins to percolate  High market valuations may be succumbing to bearish seasonality and midterm politicking as the market is on the brink of a technical breakdown through support 
So  stick to the drill and keep your powder dry  Raise some cash  Continue to weed out losing or lagging positions  pick up some more defensive holdings and wait for that fatter pitch we anticipate later in Q3 or early Q4 as we hit the sweet spot of the 4 Year Cycle

123068,344583,MKC,Rolling Down Our Put Positions  When And Why ,opinion,"Rolling Down Our Put Positions  When and Why 
When selling cash secured puts  our breakeven stock price is the  out of the money  strike price less the put premium  Our exit strategy guideline as to when to close the short put  buy back the put  is when share value declines to more than 3  below the strike price  Once we execute the buy to close trade  we no longer are committed to an option obligation and the cash used to secure the put is now freed up to secure another put  Recently  Kevin C sent me an email asking why not routinely roll down when share price declines below the 3  threshold price  Rolling down is one of our standard exit strategy considerations when share price declines in our covered call positions so why not with puts  This article will address when and why to roll down with puts and scenarios when this is not our best choice using NetApp Inc  NASDAQ NTAP  as a real life example 
Initial put selling trade with NTAP

12 18 2017  With NTAP trading at  58 50  sell the slightly out of the money  58 00 put for  2 00
Breakeven is  56 00   58 00    2 00 
Threshold for 3  guideline to buy back the puts is below  56 26
1 2 2018  Share price declines to  55 32

Initial trade calculations using the single column BCI Put Calculator

Note the following information gleaned from the BCI Put Calculator 

Initial 1 month time value  unexercised  return is 3 57   40 74  annualized  a shown by the red arrows
If the option is exercised  shares are purchased at a 4 27  discount from share price when trade was entered

Checking the option chain when closing the initial short put

Note the following 

The cost buy back the  58 00 put is  3 10 as shown in the yellow fields
To roll down to the out of the money  54 00 put strike we would generate  0 52 per share as shown in the brown fields
If share price remains above the  54 00 put strike our net option loss is  0 58 per share   2 00    0 52    3 10 
Rolling down cuts the option loss almost in half   1 10  0 58 

Do we roll down routinely to mitigate losses when trades turn against us 
No  Although rolling down should definitely be in our exit strategy arsenal  there needs to be a thought process before making a decision to execute such a trade  With covered call writing  we own the underlying so to close a position in its entirety we would need to both buy back the option and sell the underlying  With put selling  once we buy back the short put  we have no option obligation and do not own the underlying  Selling another option while early to mid contract is a no brainer  but using the same underlying is not  It is instructive to remember that the stock in question has already under performed our expectations  Do we want to stay committed to this now under performer  The guideline I use is a comparison of the recent performance of the stock compared to that of the S P 500  Let s have a look at a comparison chart of NTAP compared to the S P 500 over the time frame of the trade to date 

Note the following 

When the trade was entered  purple bar   NTAP  brown line  was trading above the S P 500
On December 20th  there was a bearish movement of NTAP price movement to below that of the S P 500
On 1 2 2018  gold bar   NTAP price continued to decline and remains under the price action of the S P 500
Had the price movement of NTAP remained above that of the S P 500  I would strongly consider rolling down
In a case like this one  I would reject rolling down and enter a new put sale with a different underlying to mitigate the current loss of  1 10 per share   3 10    2 00 


Discussion
Rolling down a short put is part of our position management arsenal but should be mainly implanted in scenarios when declining share price is out performing the overall market

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is MKC due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers McCormick  MKC  Posts Solid Q1 Earnings  Raises  18 ViewMcCormick posted solid first quarter fiscal 2018 results  with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year  The quarterly performance gained from positive acquisitions synergies  leading to growth in the consumer business and flavor solutions segments  Additionally  the company s effective product strategies and savings efforts aided growth  Encouraged by the impressive results  management raised its outlook for fiscal 2018 Adjusted earnings of  1 00 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents  Adjusted earnings were 31 6  higher year over year  owing to increased

operating income increased 38  Segment DetailsConsumer Business  Revenues grew 18 6  to  757 4 million  On a constant currency basis  sales improved almost 15   primarily driven by growth in the Americas  EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions Sales in the Americas  on a constant currency basis  was mainly driven by the acquisition of RB Foods as well as strong pricing actions and favorable impacts of volume mix  These upsides were offset by reductions in trade inventory  On a constant currency basis  sales in the EMEA region also gained from the RB Foods buyout  while sales in the Asia Pacific region were driven by growth in India and China Adjusted operating income in the consumer business segment grew 32  at constant currency  buoyed by sales growth  cost savings and favorable mix which more than offset the negative impact of higher freight and brand marketing expenses Flavor Solutions  Sales in the segment grew 18 4  from the prior year quarter to  479 7 million  On a constant currency basis  sales increased 15  on improved performance in all three regions Sales in the Americas on a constant currency basis gained from the RB Foods buyout as well as higher sales of

UpdateMcCormick exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of  179 6 million  long term debt of  4 378 6 million and shareholders  equity of  3 072 4 million During the quarter  net cash used for operations were  20 5 million compared with net cash flow provided from operations of  44 million in the prior year quarter  The decline stemmed from higher interest payments and working capital payments Fiscal 2018 GuidanceManagement is pleased with the company s first quarter performance with strong results in the company s consumer and flavors solution segments  Acquisitions as well as enhanced sales of the company s seasonings and flavors brands aided performance across geographical regions  Moreover  the company is on track with its cost savings initiatives under its CCI program and plans to achieve a target of  100 million in fiscal 2018 That said  the company expects sales to grow approximately 13 15  in fiscal 2018 from the previous projection of an increase of 12 14   The raised view takes into consideration favorable impacts of 2 percentage points from currency fluctuations  Further  management expects sales during the fiscal year to gain from acquisitions  new products  expanded distribution network and brand marketing  Additionally  the company expects low single digit increase in material costs  These are anticipated to be offset by efficient pricing action Earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected in the range of  4 85  4 95  reflecting considerable growth from the previous band of  4 80  4 90  The revised guidance depicts a growth of 14 16  from the

123103,344618,MKC,Kimberly Clark Down 9  In 3 Months  Rising Costs The Culprit ,opinion,"Kimberly Clark Corporation   NYSE KMB   has been sailing in troubled waters  thanks to the prolonged struggle with rising commodity costs  lower selling prices and increased competition in the diaper segment  These factors have weighed on the company s shares that have declined 9 4  in the past three months against the  s fall of 8 8  Rising Commodity Costs Higher input costs have been troubling Kimberly Clark s performance for a while  Evidently  commodity cost inflation of  175 million  stemming from greater costs of pulp and other raw materials  caused the company s adjusted operating profit to fall 3  in the first quarter of 2018  Such factors have also been a drag on the gross margin  which contracted roughly 890 basis points  bps  to 28  in first quarter 2018 
Prior to this  gross margin witnessed year over year declines of 200 bps  60 bps and 10 bps in the preceding three quarters  respectively  To make matters worse  management anticipates input cost inflation of about  400  550 million for 2018  We expect that such aspects will persistently dampen profits 
Apart from Kimberly Clark  other consumer staples companies such as McCormick   Company   NYSE MKC    Church   Dwight Co    NYSE CHD   and TreeHouse Foods   NYSE THS   have also been struggling with higher commodity costs  which has been marring their profitability Lower Net PricesLower selling prices are another hurdle faced by this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company  In fact  during first quarter 2018  this trend lingered and affected results in most segments  Evidently  lower net selling prices dragged sales and operating profits of Kimberly Clark s Personal Care as well as K C Professional  KCP  divisions  Moreover  such deterrents limit the company s ability to fend off negative impacts stemming from rising commodity costs 

Prolonged Weakness in the Diaper SegmentKimberly Clark s diaper segment  that holds a vital place in the Personal Care category  has been bearing the brunt of increased competition across several markets  The segment remains particularly challenged in South Korea  due to lower birth rates  The bleak performance of the diaper unit also puts the company s market share at risk Any Rays of Hope Ahead Considering the constant struggle with rising commodity costs  it only seems natural for Kimberly Clark to undertake aggressive measures to cut costs  The company s Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE Program has generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of  450 million in 2017  In the first quarter  Kimberly Clark generated savings of  90 million from this program and projects cost savings of  400 million in 2018 
The company estimates more than  1 5 billion to be generated over the four year period from 2018 to 2021  These savings are expected to be achieved through management s focus on enhancing productivity at manufacturing facilities  optimizing design and raw material expenses and attaining distribution efficiencies Speaking of building efficiencies  Kimberly Clark s recently embarked 2018 Global Restructuring Program deserves special mention  This plan is likely to enhance the company s underlying profitability  enable it to compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth oriented investments  On a combined basis  the company expects cost savings of more than  2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program  over the next four years While Kimberly Clark s savings efforts seem quite robust  they are yet to fully offset the negative impacts from the aforementioned hurdles  That said  let s wait and see if such initiatives yield favorable impacts in the forthcoming periods and lift investors  optimism

123104,344619,MKC,McCormick Rallies On Savings Efforts  Buyouts   Tax Gains,opinion,"McCormick   Company Inc    NYSE MKC   has been faring well in the industry  buoyed by yielding buyouts and cost containment efforts  This has aided year over year growth in top and bottom lines for more than a year now  Let s now look into some of the factors that have been supporting this global leader in spices and seasonings  alongside analyzing the hurdles that have been denting performance Acquisitions Provide Scope for Growth  Buyouts have been aiding McCormick to expand flavors business and reap grater profitability  The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017  is the largest deal by the company till date  With iconic brands like Frank s RedHot Sauce and French s Mustard  RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick s spices portfolio 
The buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA bolstered performances of consumer and flavor solutions units  driving sales by 12  during the first quarter of fiscal 2018  Notably  a number of companies operating in the food industry such as TreeHouse Foods   NYSE THS   and Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY   have also been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects Effective Cost ManagementMoving on  McCormick s Comprehensive Continuous Improvement   CCI   program has been an aspect of cheer for a while  The program aids the company to focus on savings and enhance productivity  It has used CCI savings to increase investments  which lead to higher sales and profits   Notably  cost savings from CCI improved the company s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 
This also marked the company s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion  Further  the company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23 25  in fiscal 2018  wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of  100 million 
Resorting to cost saving initiatives to induce efficiency is a common practice in the consumer staples space  For instance  Tyson Foods    NYSE TSN   is on track with its Financial Fitness Program with the motive to induce supply chain efficiencies  reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Amazon  AMZN   AbbVie  ABBV  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   BIIB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Amazon s shares have outperformed the broader market in the year to date period  the stock is up  59 2  vs  the  17 7  gain for the S P 500 as a whole   Amazon is benefiting from strong growth in all its businesses and especially the retail business remains very hard to beat on price  choice and convenience  
The Zacks analyst likes Amazon s solid loyalty system  Prime  Its FBA strategy and content additions continue to add selection to Prime memberships  AWS generates much higher margins than retail  thus significantly impacting Amazon s profitability  Devices and IoT are also potential growth areas  
However  increased operating expenses to support expansion of its business into new markets and territories  localize the availability of products and grow its content will keep margins under pressure

Shares of AbbVie have gained  52 4  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has gained  16 2  over the same period  AbbVie s key drug Humira has been performing well  At the Q3 earnings call  AbbVie raised its long term target for Humira sales based on strong demand trends for the drug  despite new competition  
Moreover  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases  Meanwhile  the past 2 3 months have been strong for the company as it presented promising data from several pivotal studies and gained regulatory approvals in the U S   Europe  and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret  
Additionally  it gained FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbrivica and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Also  several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018  However  HCV sales continue to be hurt by intensifying competition

Meanwhile  Spinraza has witnessed strong patient uptake in the U S  and internationally  However  weakening MS trends is a concern  Tecfidera is witnessing slight decline in U S  patient demand due to increasing competition from oral medicines and a slowdown in the overall MS market 
The recent Ocrevus launch by Roche is beginning to have a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the U S   mainly Tysabri  At the call  the company said that seasonality and continued competitive pressure from Ocrevus  launch will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in Q4

to beat on price  choice and convenience The Zacks analyst likes Amazon s solid loyalty system  Prime  Its FBA strategy and content additions continue to add selection to Prime memberships  AWS generates much higher margins than retail  thus significantly impacting Amazon s profitability  Devices and IoT are also potential growth areas However  increased operating expenses to support expansion of its business into new markets and territories  localize the availability of products and grow its content will keep margins under pressure  You can   Shares of AbbVie have gained  52 4  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which has gained  16 2  over the same period  AbbVie s key drug Humira has been performing well  At the Q3 earnings call

the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases  Meanwhile  the past 2 3 months have been strong for the company as it presented promising data from several pivotal

others Meanwhile  Spinraza has witnessed strong patient uptake in the U S  and internationally  However  weakening MS trends is a concern  Tecfidera is witnessing slight decline in U S  patient demand due to increasing competition from oral medicines and a slowdown in the overall MS market The recent Ocrevus launch by Roche is beginning to have a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the U S   mainly Tysabri  At the call  the company said that seasonality and continued competitive pressure from Ocrevus  launch will hurt the performance of its MS franchise in Q4   You can   Other noteworthy

for 2017 after reporting in line third quarter 2017 earnings  This marked an improvement from the company s negative earnings surprises delivered in the preceding three quarters  However  the company s sales lagged estimates Further  this Dallas based food and beverage company s shares have plunged 20 1  in three months  wider than the  sector s downside of 3 1  Despite a tough retail backdrop  the company s results gained from overall solid sales execution  which helped in wining some new business for 2018  Though the company displayed stringent focus on cost productivity and commercial initiatives  results were hurt by lost sales volumes and incremental costs related to the recent hurricanes in both Texas and Florida  The company estimates that the hurricanes impacted business in the third quarter by nearly  6 million or 4 cents of earnings per share  The impacts primarily related to revenue lost  soft resin supplies and increased freight Further  soft volumes  higher raw milk costs  and loss of share in U S  fluid milk volumes were hindrances Q3 in DetailPlagued by lower volumes and increased raw milk expenses  the company s quarterly adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share came in line with Zacks Consensus Estimate while it plunged 45 9  year over year Dean Foods Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   On GAAP basis  the company posted loss per share of 11 cents  against earnings of 16 cents reported in the year ago quarter Net sales declined 1 4  year over year to  1 937 6 million  and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 973 million  Total volumes of 608 million gallons dropped 6 6  from 651 million gallons in the prior year quarter  The lag was mainly due to volume and private label mix challenges that continued in the quarter Raw milk costs escalated about 10  year over year and nearly 7  on a sequential basis  which also impacted top line Further  the milk category remained soft as the USDA data through August 2017 revealed that fluid milk volumes dipped 2 2  year over year  on a quarter to date basis  Additionally  Dean Foods  share of U S  fluid milk volumes contracted 50 basis points Adjusted gross profit declined 9 1  to  448 million  while the adjusted operating income collapsed by 34 8  to  45 million in the third quarter Financial PositionDean Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  24 3 million  long term debt including current maturities of about  946 5 million  and shareholders  equity of  604 4 million  Total debt outstanding  excluding cash on hand  was nearly  928 million as of Sep 30

capital expenditure in the nine months of 2017  As of the end of the third quarter  Dean Foods  all cash netted leverage  net debt to bank EBITDA total leverage ratio  came in at 2 56 times  reflecting slight increase from second quarter 2017 In the fourth quarter  the company expects free cash flow to benefit from sequential rise in operating results  partly offset by seasonal ice cream build and higher capital expenditures  Further  management significantly lowered its free cash flow guidance for 2017 to  10  20 million  from the prior forecast of  60  75 million  Additionally  the company trimmed its capital expenditure forecast for the year to  105  115 million The Road AheadWhile the third quarter performance remained soft  the company expects to gain from its smart volume initiative through the rest of 2017  aimed at improving top line  building margins and creating operating efficiencies  This initiative relates to managing private label products  while also analyzing new volume opportunities and evaluating existing volume profitability  This means ensuring that volumes are produced and sold at appropriate margins Additionally  the company s initiatives to

has been witnessing year over year growth in earnings since 2014 Further  management reaffirmed its full year adjusted earnings guidance at the low end of its previously stated range  It looks like the conservative stance and a decline in top line weighed upon investors  sentiment  as Pinnacle Foods  shares dipped 3 1  on Oct 26  Nonetheless  backed by an impressive earnings history  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has rallied 8 9  over a year  as against the  s downside of 7 1  Q3 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 58 cents per share rose 9 4  from the year ago period  and came a penny ahead of

slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  749 million  While underlying sales grew 3 1   it was more than offset by an adverse 3 6  impact from the exit of certain low margin Aunt Jemima  AJ

plan  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma also dented net sales by 0 7  Management further stated that the company s in market performance remained quite strong in the third quarter  as its retail consumption

period Adjusted gross profit decreased 5 4  to  216 7 million with the gross margin contraction of 130 basis points  bps  to 28 9   This was attributable to adverse impacts from the hurricanes along with various discrete costs associated with AJ s exit and production investments undertaken in second quarter 2017 Consequently  adjusted earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  slipped 3 1  to  130 4 million in the quarter Segment DetailsFrozen  Segment sales declined 4 1  to  301 4 million on account of the hurricanes and AJ s exit  Underlying sales remained flat year over year  as favorable impacts from net realized pricing and currency translations were offset by lower volume mix  Adjusted EBIT for the segment dropped 11 1  to  52 5 million  owing to the aforementioned discrete costs

favorable net price realization  partly countered by the detrimental impacts from hurricanes  Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 4 7  to  58 million backed by enhanced net sales  productivity savings and synergies from the Boulder Brands acquisition  These were offset by the factors that hurt operating income at the Frozen segment Boulder  Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15  2016  Consequently  it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  In third quarter 2017  sales at the Boulder segment jumped 9 3  to  101 million  fueled by robust underlying volume mix growth  along with favorable net price realization  This was somewhat mitigated by the SKU rationalization program and shutdown of the Boulder UK operations  Adjusted EBIT for the Boulder Brands segment totaled  18 6 million  representing a surge of 49  from the prior year quarter Specialty Foods  Segment sales tumbled 17 2  to  77 million due to reduced volume mix  impacts from the AJ exit and lower net price realization  Well  the volume mix was majorly hurt by the company s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business  Also  the segment s adjusted EBIT plunged 21 3  to  7 3 million in the reported quarter Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  131 3 million  long term debt of  2 936 4 million  and total

123265,344780,MKC,Treat Yourself To These 4 Food Stocks This Holiday Season ,opinion,"Despite the fact that input costs are on the rise across the industry with additional capacity only likely to increase these costs further  there are some food stocks with something unique to offer that make them Strong Buys  Zacks Rank  1    You can see   
Since I ve chosen a motley crowd  including a specialty foods supplier  a frozen foods supplier and a couple of meat producers  it s hard to get into industry specifics  Suffice it to say that not all food companies are created equal  So there are opportunities in the space that we can tap into   
McCormick   Company  Inc    NYSE MKC  
McCormick   Co is a global leader in the manufacture  marketing and distribution of spices  herbs  seasonings  flavorings and other specialty food products  The company also  through subsidiary corporations  manufactures and markets specialty plastic bottles and tubes for food  personal care and other industries 
The factors pressuring the market include rising input costs  increasing private label competition particularly given Amazon s Whole Foods acquisition and  in McCormick s case  also high  although manageable  financial leverage  Finally  there was the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser s food division  including Frank s Red Hot and French s mustard that required it to both issue fresh shares  so dilution  and additional debt  so increased leverage  
But there are also factors working in its favor  including the benefits from the acquisition such as market consolidation and therefore increased negotiating power with retailers  scope for international expansion and management s stated goal of bringing down the leverage over the next three years with the resultant positive impact on earnings  The acquisition aside  McCormick enjoys a coveted position in the specialty foods space because it sells spices  use of which is likely to increase as against sugary or salty foods sold by others  usage of which is coming down  It therefore enjoys some pricing power 
The industrial business is a nice complement to the consumer business and provides a hedge because it generates stronger growth off a smaller base of more diverse customers  The company also shows a slow and steady earnings growth rate  which helps it pay a nice dividend year upon year  
The company is expected to grow revenue 9 3  in 2017 and less than 11 5  in 2018  It is expected to grow earnings 10 9  and 10 8   respectively  this year and next  The current quarter earnings estimate is up 4 2   The 2017 estimate is up 2 7  and 2018 estimate is up 4 3  in the last 60 days  The company topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 4 0  
Nomad Foods   NYSE NOMD  
Feltham  UK based Nomad Foods Ltd  manufactures and distributes frozen foods primarily in the United Kingdom  Italy  Germany  Sweden  France and Norway  The company s portfolio of frozen food brands includes Birds Eye  Iglo and Findus  which it acquired over the last few years 
Nomad s strategy is to grow through acquisitions  It typically focuses resources on 4 5 categories in each country  in which it seeks to command significant market share and generate strong gross margins  These categories are  by definition  its  must win battles   attracting the bulk of R D  advertising and promotion money  Another group comprising 10 20  of revenue gets some R D but no advertising money  The rest of the business is managed for cost and allowed to die a natural death where necessary  
The company is expected to grow revenue 6 7  in 2017 and less than 1  in 2018  It is expected to grow earnings 19 6  and 17 7   respectively  this year and next  The earnings estimate for the December quarter is up 33 3   The 2017 estimate is up 11 1  and 2018 estimate is up 18 2  in the last 60 days 
Tyson Foods   NYSE TSN  
Tyson Foods is the world s largest fully integrated producer  processor and marketer of chicken and poultry based food products  Tyson is a comprehensive supplier of value added chicken products through food service  retail grocery stores  club stores and international distribution channels  Although its core business is chicken  in the U S   Tyson is also the second largest maker of corn and flour tortillas under the Mexican Original brand and through its subsidiary Cobb Vantress  the top chicken breeding stock supplier 
The meat production industry is highly competitive although Tyson  along with a few others command leading market share  All the top meat producers have extensive chicken processing operations  so they have been impacted by regulatory scrutiny on price fixing charges  It s also true that for whatever reason  chicken prices have been robust  helping these companies 
The other factor is demand  which is based on increased consumption across the world  especially by the growing middle class in developing countries that will account for most of the growth  The USDA estimates that broiler meat production will grow 1  this year partly because of numerous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza  HPAI  across Asia  Africa  Europe  Russia and the U S  as offset by the growing demand for low cost animal protein  Given the low production growth rate  companies with a broad product range  distribution capacity relationships are likely to be more successful  provided they can also find a way to keep costs down  
It s also been reported that major distributors grocers like Costco  NASDAQ COST  are starting their own poultry operations  which may have an impact on the big meat producers and can also hurt their margins 
Tyson also generates some revenue from other meats like beef that while generating lower margins  result in steadier volumes  China lifting the beef ban is a positive in this respect  which along with continued strength in domestic demand are good for its results 
Tyson has consistently grown revenues in each of the last 10 years barring 2016  That trend is already reversing this year  Gross profits  EBIT  EBITDA and net income have also moved up steadily  particularly after 2014  With cost savings from the AdvancePierre integration  supply chain improvements and elimination of 450 management positions across three locations yet to kick in  the company is likely to see margin expansion  The recent spike in the debt level may help finance the Kansas chicken processing plant it s planning to build 
Tyson s surprise history hasn t been anything to write home about  with the company missing estimates almost as frequently as it beat  But it s encouraging that its earnings estimates are showing an upward trend  Accordingly  estimates for 2017 and 2018 are up 1  and 6 8   respectively  Overall earnings are expected to be up 17 0  this year and 7 3  in 2018 despite much slower revenue growth expectations 
Pilgrim s Pride Corp    NASDAQ PPC  
Pilgrim s Pride is one of the largest chicken companies in the U S   Mexico and Puerto Rico  The company s fresh chicken retail line is sold throughout the U S   throughout Puerto Rico  and in the northern and central regions of Mexico  Its prepared chicken products are sold to some of the largest customers in the food service industry across the US  Additionally  commodity chicken products are exported to over 90 countries 
Being a vertically integrated company  it controls every phase of the production including feed mills  hatcheries  processing plants and distribution centers across the U S   Puerto Rico and Mexico  This helps it to keep costs down 
The company recently acquired JBS owned Moy Park  which has extensive operations in the UK from where it sources its chickens  These are mostly sold to supermarkets and quick service restaurants in the UK and Ireland itself although some of the production is also sold to European countries  So the acquisition enables expansion into the European market through a local player  This is perfect in terms of acceptance  local brand   geographical diversification  an important market in Europe  and cost savings  costs to be eliminated on integration of Moy Park will be around  50 million  
People s Pride s revenue shows an upward trend over the last ten years  While 2015 and 2016 could have been better  2017 is shaping up to be a good year with the revenue growth returning  The profitability ratios tell the same story  Moreover  2017 estimates have jumped 98  and 2018 estimated have jumped over 10  in the last 60 days  The surprise ratio has been generally disappointing  but there was a positive  turning point   in the last quarter    
Wrapping Up
While each of these companies have a strong market position and factors supporting steady growth over the long term  it s worth noting that they are all trading at a premium to the industry  So while some may fear downside risk  the fact remains that these are stocks that we may want to accumulate

123267,344782,MKC,Food Industry Staples  3 Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"While some investors might want to look for the next hot sector or up and coming industry to dive into  sometimes investing in more everyday industries can prove just as beneficial and profitable 
With that said  we will look at three companies that hold unique positions in an industry close to many peoples  hearts  food 
On top of their standing as big names in their respective food industry segments  these three firms also hold strong Zacks Ranks  Let s take a look at some of their current fundamentals to see if investors might want to grab these food stocks from the grocery aisle 
McCormick   Company   NYSE MKC  
This maker of ubiquitous seasonings and spices is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and scored an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system 
McCormick s 6 10  year to date price change is less than the S P 500  but its 6 62  12 week price change shows that it could be starting to heat up right now 
On top of this  McCormick is an interesting growth pick 
McCormick s current cash flow growth of 6 61  is above its industry s average  and along with its 0 95 current ratio and 26  return on equity which both also top the industry average this helps show that the spice maker is growing 
And based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  McCormick s sales are expected to jump 20 31  this quarter to hit  1 5 billion  For the full year  the company s revenue is projected to grow 9 25  to touch an upward estimate of  4 84 billion 
McCormick s quarterly earnings are set to pop 19 49  based on our current estimates  while the company s full year EPS is expected to gain 11 59  to reach  4 24 per share  This marks strong growth for such an established company in a niche seasoning sector that hasn t changed much in years 
Shares of McCormick sit roughly 7  below their 52 week high  which means the flavor making power has room to climb  and the company has missed earnings expectations just twice since the start of 2013 
United Natural Foods  Inc    NASDAQ UNFI  
United Natural Foods is one of the leading national distributors of grass fed antibiotic and hormone free natural protein  as well as natural deli meats  cheese  bakery goods  and prepared foods 
This massive natural food supplier is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and also sports an  A  grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system  which helped it earn an overall  A  VGM grade 
UNFI is currently trading at 15x earnings  which is well below the  Food   Miscellaneous  industry s average P E ratio of 21 53  The company s P B ratio of 1 22 marks a 58 6  discount to the industry average  while United Natural s 0 22 P S ratio also beats the industry s 1 23 average  These metrics help to show that the natural food company could be a value play for investors at this time 
Furthermore  United Natural s 3 19 sales to assets ratio crushes the industry s average of 1 13  The company s 7 58  current cash flow also tops the industry s 5 84  average and helps show that the company is on a strong growth trajectory 
Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  United Natural s revenues are projected to pop 4 85  in its current quarter  On top of that  the company s sales are expected to climb 4 52  for the year to hit an upward estimate of  9 72 billion  UNFI s earnings are projected to gain 1 23  in the current quarter and jump over 5  for the year 
In the last 12 weeks  the company has seen its stock price climb 10 43  while the  Food   Miscellaneous  industry has been flat  This means shares of UNFI could continue to gain before they come close to breaking through a new threshold 
Pinnacle Foods   NYSE PF   
The maker of Duncan Hines  Hungry Man  Vlasic  and many more packaged staples  has seen its stock price climb 14 59  over the last year  Today  Pinnacle Foods is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and scored an overall VGM grade of a  C  
Pinnacle Foods  14 97  current cash flow growth far outpaces the industry s 5 84  average and helps show that the company is expanding  On top of that  the company s earnings per share are projected to climb 8 49  in its current quarter  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates 
For the year the company s revenues are only set to gain 0 93  to hit  3 20 billion  But for an established firm like Pinnacle Foods  those small gains represent somewhat solid growth  More than that  the packaged food giant s earnings are expected to gain 18 76  for the year  which helps to show that the company has set its sights on drastically improving its bottom line 
In addition to this  Pinnacle offers a respectable 2 27  dividend and could be an attractive option for income focused investors

Operating as Duluth Trading  it offers casual wear  workwear and accessories It uses humor and storytelling to convey the uniqueness of its products which are sold exclusively through its website  catalogs and 26 retail locations  It s best known for its funny television commercials  It also stands by its  No Bull Guarantee  A Beat in the Second QuarterOn Sept 5  Duluth reported its second quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus by 3 cents  Earnings were  0 13 versus the consensus of  0 10 Despite fears on Wall Street that Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is taking over the retail world  Duluth saw net sales increase 31  to  86 2 million from  65 8 million in the prior year It was the 30th consecutive quarter of increased year over year net sales  It saw a 35  increase in new customer acquisition thanks to a push in its direct marketing efforts and geographical expansion of its retail stores For instance  I recently got a Duluth catalog in the mail for the first time  And who hasn t seen its television commercials by now As of the end of the second quarter  it had opened 9 new stores this year  bucking the  brick and mortar is dying  theme and is on track to open six more stores for the remainder of the year  That would be a total of 15 new stores in fiscal 2017 Reaffirmed Its Full Year OutlookThe company reaffirmed full year outlook  That includes earnings in the range of  0 66 to  0 71 The analysts have fiscal 2017 estimates on the high end of the range The Zacks Consensus Estimate is  0 70 which is a gain of 5 6  over the  0 66 it made last year Next year  analysts are even more bullish  They see earnings jumping 20 3  to  0 84 Shares Hit By Retail MalaiseEven though the news looks good out of Wisconsin  retail stocks have been out of favor with investors Duluth shares are down 24  year to date But even with the sell off  shares still aren t cheap  They trade with a forward P E of 27 For investors looking for a retailer that is growing  instead of contracting  then Duluth is one to keep on the short list  Carrols Restaurant Group  Inc   Nasdaq        a Burger King operator  is facing pressure from rising wages and commodity costs  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected to see a 68  drop in earnings this year Carrols is the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States with 799 restaurants as of July 2  2017  It has operated Burger King restaurants since 1976 Fourth Miss in a RowOn Aug 9  Carrols reported its second quarter results and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter in a row Earnings were  0 14 versus the  0 19 estimate The good news is that comparable restaurant sales rose 4 6  compared to just a 0 7  comp in the prior year period due to a balance of premium products  value offerings and limited time offers However  the company was pressured by rising wage rates  commodity cost inflation  including a spike in beef costs in the quarter  and a higher level of promotional discounting Moderate Growth in the Second Half ExpectedCarrols believes it can produce moderate growth in comparable store sales in the second half of the year thanks to Burger King promotions However  rising wage pressures aren t going anywhere as the job market remains tight  Additionally  the heavily promotional burger environment is unlikely to change either One bright spot is the price of beef  wherein the price increases have receded and should be moderate for the rest of the year Analysts Bearish for 2017 and 2018Despite the comparable restaurant gains in the quarter  the analysts are bearish on this year and next The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to  0 13 from  0 28 in the last 90 days That s a decline of 68  as the company made  0 40 last year Additionally  2018 doesn t look so great either  The Zacks Consensus has fallen to  0 17 from  0 42 over the last 3 months Shares Fall But Are They Cheap Carrols shares have fallen 23  year to date as the restaurant stocks have fallen out of favor with investors But even with this year s sell off  they re still not cheap Carrols trades with a forward P E of 87 6 Additional content Food Industry Staples  3 Stocks to Buy NowWhile some investors might want to look for the next hot sector or up and coming industry to dive into  sometimes investing in more everyday industries can prove just as beneficial and profitable With that said  we will look at three companies that hold unique positions in an industry close to many peoples  hearts  food On top of their standing as big names in their respective food industry segments  these three firms also hold strong Zacks Ranks  Let s take a look at some of their current fundamentals to see if investors might want to grab these food stocks from the grocery aisle McCormick   Company  NYSE      This maker of ubiquitous seasonings and spices is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and scored an  A  grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system McCormick s 6 10  year to date price change is less than the S P 500  but its 6 62  12 week price change shows that it could be starting to heat up right now On top of this  McCormick is an interesting growth pick McCormick s current cash flow growth of 6 61  is above its industry s average  and along with its 0 95 current ratio and 26  return on equity which both also top the industry average this helps show that the spice maker is growing And based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  McCormick s sales are expected to jump 20 31  this quarter to hit  1 5 billion  For the full year  the company s revenue is projected to grow 9 25  to touch an upward estimate of  4 84 billion McCormick s quarterly earnings are set to pop 19 49  based on our current estimates  while the company s full year EPS is expected to gain 11 59  to reach  4 24 per share  This marks strong growth for such an established company in a niche seasoning sector that hasn t changed much in years Shares of McCormick sit roughly 7  below their 52 week high  which means the flavor making power has room to climb  and the company has missed earnings expectations just twice since the start of 2013 United Natural Foods  Inc   Nasdaq      United Natural Foods is one of the leading national distributors of grass fed antibiotic and hormone free natural protein  as well as natural deli meats  cheese  bakery goods  and prepared foods This massive natural food supplier is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and also sports an  A  grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system  which helped it earn an overall  A  VGM grade UNFI is currently trading at 15x earnings  which is well below the  Food   Miscellaneous  industry s average P E ratio of 21 53  The company s P B ratio of 1 22 marks a 58 6  discount to the industry average  while United Natural s 0 22 P S ratio also beats the industry s 1 23 average  These metrics help to show that the natural food company could be a value play for investors at this time Furthermore  United Natural s 3 19 sales to assets ratio crushes the industry s average of 1 13  The company s 7 58  current cash flow also tops the industry s 5 84  average and helps show that the company is on a strong growth trajectory Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  United Natural s revenues are projected to pop 4 85  in its current quarter  On top of that  the company s sales are expected to climb 4 52  for the year to hit an upward estimate of  9 72 billion  UNFI s earnings are projected to gain 1 23  in the current quarter and jump over 5  for the year In the last 12 weeks  the company has seen its stock price climb 10 43  while the  Food   Miscellaneous  industry has been flat  This means shares of UNFI could continue to gain before they come close to breaking through a new threshold Pinnacle Foods  NYSE      The maker of Duncan Hines  Hungry Man  Vlasic  and many more packaged staples  has seen its stock price climb 14 59  over the last year  Today  Pinnacle Foods is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and scored an overall VGM grade of a  C  Pinnacle Foods  14 97  current cash flow growth far outpaces the industry s 5 84  average and helps show that the

revenues are only set to gain 0 93  to hit  3 20 billion  But for an established firm like Pinnacle Foods  those small gains represent somewhat solid growth  More than that  the packaged food giant s earnings are expected to gain 18 76  for the year  which helps to show that the company has set its sights on drastically improving its bottom line In addition to this  Pinnacle offers a respectable 2 27  dividend and could be an attractive option for income focused investors  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment

123297,344812,MKC,Earnings Preview  ConAgra Brands In Focus,opinion," NYSE CAG  is expected to report earnings on Thursday  September 28th before the market opens  The company s shares last traded at  33 29 as of mid day Monday  down 22  over the last year and down 10  since Q4 17 earnings were reported on June 29th 
ConAgra Brands  results have been mixed of late as illustrated in the table below  Although the company has missed its top line estimate seven of the last eleven quarters  reported  has positively surprised investors nine of the last eleven quarters  When management reports an EBITDA beat  the stock has increased 3 1  on average immediately following the announcement  However  shares have fallen 5 6  on average when management reports a disappointing EBITDA figure 

We highlight below what investors should be looking for prior to the earnings report on Thursday 
Investors Focusing on EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization  It is a commonly used metric in valuation as a proxy for operating profitability because it provides a clearer picture of overall profitability  especially when benchmarking against comparable companies  This is because it ignores non operating costs that can be affected by certain items such as a company s financing decisions or political jurisdictions 
The company s adjusted EBITDA stands at  1 193 million as of fiscal year ending May 2017  This is only 0 3  higher than the  1 190 million achieved in fiscal year May 2012  ConAgra Brands  EBITDA growth has been highly volatile ranging from  43 0  to 74 6  over the last five fiscal years  The company s  has also been volatile ranging from 7 9  to 15 2  over the same period source  On a quarterly basis  ConAgra Brands  EBITDA growth and margin have also been highly volatile over the previous twelve quarters source  Going forward  analysts forecast that ConAgra Brands  EBITDA will reach  1 761 million by fiscal year 2022 representing a five year CAGR of 8 1   This is well above what the company has been able to achieve historically source  Wall Street analysts are also forecasting that EBITDA margins will reach 21 7  by fiscal year 2022  a sizable increase from its current EBITDA margin of 15 2  
What Bullish Investors Point To
A company s  is calculated by dividing its  by  and is often used to benchmark the fair market value of a company  Its key benefit over the  is that it s capital structure neutral  and  therefore  better at comparing companies with different levels of debt 
Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes   NYSE  CPB     NYSE  K     NYSE  HSY  and   NYSE  NYSE MKC   ConAgra s market valuation looks attractive relative to these peers source  The company s P E multiple of 21 6x is below all of its comparable public companies  CPB  28 0x   K  27 9x   HSY  33 6x  and MKC  26 3x   Additionally  its EBITDA multiple of 13 9x is below K  16 1x   HSY  18 2x  and MKC  18 0x  and only slightly above CPB  13 5x  
Furthermore  Wall Street analysts see higher upside potential in ConAgra Brands shares compared to its peers  The consensus 12 month price target is the average of each individual sell side Wall Street analyst  The consensus analyst upside or downside equals the percentage difference between the price target and the current stock price  The calculation is simply Upside    Analyst Price Target   Stock Price    1 source  The company s consensus analyst upside of 22 3  is above all of its selected comparable public companies  CPB  11 3    K  17 8    HSY  5 1   and MKC  5 7   
What Bearish Investors Point To
EBITDA margin measures the portion of revenue a company converts to earnings  It is a strong measure of a company s pricing power and capital efficiency  All else equal  companies with higher EBITDA margins command higher valuation multiples  This may help explain why ConAgra Brands  valuation multiples trade at a discount to its peers source  The company s EBITDA margin of 15 2  is above only above K  14 3   and below CPB  15 6    HSY  18 5   and MKC  17 1    What s more  ConAgra Brands projected performance is mediocre relative to this same peer group 
 is the average annual growth rate of EBITDA over a five year period  It s calculated as follows  5yr CAGR     EBITDA FY 5   EBITDA FY      1 5 years    1  The chart below plots the five year EBITDA compounded annual growth rate for ConAgra Brands and its peers source  The company s projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR of 8 1  is right in the middle of the pack relative to its comparable companies  Bearish investors argue that ConAgra Brands  valuation multiples should trade at a discount as a result of its mediocre growth forecast and weak margins 
Bearish investors also highlight Campbell Soup s  on August 31st where the stock dropped nearly 10   Its CEO Denise Morrison said on the earnings call that  several variables are at play including value players expanding their presence in the U S   the growth of store brands and the explosion of e commerce and meal delivery services disrupting the market  We expect conditions to remain hyper competitive for the foreseeable future  Value investors holding a position in ConAgra Brands  shares should consider the above fundamentals prior to the company reporting earnings on Thursday The article was originally published  ",2017-09-25,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-conagra-brands-in-focus-200215256,200215256
123298,344813,MKC,Tax Plan Hurdles  Stocks Rise On Tech Strength And Financials  Gold Falls To Low ,opinion,"I am not real sure what the exact reasons are  but the S P 500 futures  ESZ17 CME  is stuck in a 10 handle  point  trading range  give or take a few  Does it have to do with global risk  or is it interest rates  or the dollar  Whatever it is  the VIX is not showing much fear  and the way I see the price action  it has been  back and filling  for the last two weeks  I thought the ES could make new highs this week  and when it shot up to 2505 00 yesterday it looked pretty good  but like i said on the MrTopStep chat before the open  sellers would show up on the gap  and that is exactly what they did 
Republican Tax Plan Unveiled
The reason they did was the tax framework showed that the plan proposes to reduce the tax rate on businesses and many individuals  The problem for the stock market was that traders were skeptical that a tax overhaul will pass 
Yesterday  the ES rallied on Globex  the total range was was 2494 25 to 2503 00  with 200 000 ES traded before the 8 30 CT open  The first print was 2503 00  after which the ES traded up to 2505 00 at 9 00 am CT  After that  several sell programs pushed the ES down to its support at 2493 00 at 10 00 CT  From there  it stutter stepped up to 2498 50  pulled back down to 2495 75  and then popped above the vwap to 2500 00 at around 12 30 
While the fed has made it clear to gradually raise interest rates yesterday  the bond market was signaling something different  as investors continued to bet on higher U S  interest rates  The CBOT s fed funds contract  which showed a 73  chance of a December rate hike a week ago  jumped to 83   which helped support bank stocks   B of A  2 80   CitiGroup   2 35   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    1 75  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   1 10   
At 1 14 pm CT  the ES traded up to 2505 00  and then up to 2508 00 a few minutes later  At 1 20 total volume was only 1 1 million contracts traded  After a small pull back down to 2505 25 the ES traded up to a new high at 2509 25 as the MiM flipped from buy  190 million to sell  96 million MOC  After the flip the ES sold backed off down to 2503 50 
In the end it was a very good day for the markets  Despite some late profit taking the S P 500 futures  ESZ17 CME  settled at 2504 50  up  9 00 handles  or  0 36   the Dow Jones futures  YMZ17 CBT  settled at 22298  up  39 points  or  0 17   and the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQZ17 CME  settled at 5941 00  up  48 50 points  or 0 82   and the Russell 2000  RTYZ17 CME  settled at 1487 90  up  2 01  on the day

New Highs   Pull Back Time  Don t Get Bullish Into The Big Rally When The Ship Has Already Sailed
Our View  Well  all the  back and filling  finally took hold  with the S P running to new all time highs  Today there is a high level of economic and earnings reports to get past  and once it does  I still lean to higher prices  There is a  but  in all this though  and with all the news about the failed health care push  and the tax plan out in the open  it s possible we see some selling 
Our view is that you can sell the early rallies  especially if the futures gap higher  or just wait for the pullbacks and buy weakness

123335,344850,MKC,Sysco Vs  McCormick  Which Food Stock Tastes Better Now ,opinion,"The grocery industry is going through a rough patch currently  The industry has grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment  Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals  who are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples  Customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low cost alternatives to national brands  which are hurting the food companies 
The problems worsened when e Commerce major Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   announced an all cash  13 7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM     On Aug 28  Amazon closed the Whole Foods deal  following Federal Trade Commission s approval last week 
The deal s impact can be clearly seen in lowered grocery prices of Whole Foods  creating apprehensions at several grocery store chains like Kroger Co    NYSE KR    Costco Wholesale Corporation   NASDAQ COST    Sprouts Farmers Market Inc    NASDAQ SFM   of pricing pressure  squeezed margins and dwindling customers  It is also expected to further increase the competition in the industry 
Given this backdrop  let s try to ascertain which of these two key food players   Sysco Corporation   NYSE SYY   and McCormick   Company Inc    NYSE MKC    is presently in good shape and can make for a better investment option  We note that both Sysco and McCormick carry the Zacks Rank  3  Hold   highlighting the fact that they are likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next one to three months  You can see 
Sysco s market capitalization is  27 4 billion  while that of McCormick is  11 8 billion  Going by its business size  Sysco is undoubtedly a winner  Though Sysco s massive scale of operations better position it in the long term  short term industry headwinds are likely to adversely impact both the companies 
Business Operations
Sysco s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters  which have been primarily attributed to its continued focus on acquisitions  volume growth  rewarding shareholders and margin improvement through cost savings  Sysco s acquisition of London based Brakes Group in Jul 2016 has benefited the company significantly 
Sysco has also been impressively managing expenses since the past few years  The company is making progress in both SG A and supply chain and as a result  the company achieved  417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately  600 million to  650 million through the end of FY18 
Though stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment remain a concern  Sysco s efforts to boost sales and margins are paying up  as the company has delivered positive gross margins in the last nine consecutive quarters  after declining consistently for the last few quarters 
Like Sysco  McCormick s earnings have also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters  on the back of rising demand for spices  herbs and seasonings over the last few years  Product innovation  brand marketing support and expanded distribution  as well as pricing actions are also fueling sales growth  However  higher material costs remain its headwinds 
Prices of raw materials such as vanilla  garlic  cinnamon  oregano and rice  as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing  and thereby affecting McCormick s margins  Though McCormick is working on its expense structure and remains hopeful to accelerate its margins in the remainder of fiscal 2017  the company expects material cost inflation in mid single digits for fiscal 2017 
VGM Score
With the help of our new   it is easy to pick the winning stocks  In order to screen out potential value stocks  we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  and a Value Score of A or B  However  if we consider stocks with a Zacks Rank  3  we should opt for a better grade 
Sysco seems to outpace McCormick on VGM Score as well  as Sysco s score of A is favorable than McCormick s VGM Score of D  Hence  we should consider it a favorable investing option 
Price Performance
The food industry has been struggling from quite some time now  However  the concerns aggravated after the Amazon Whole Foods deal  which is well reflected in the share price performance of the companies as well as the industry  If we look into the last three months performance of these stocks  we note that while the  declined 8 6  in the said time frame  shares of McCormick slipped 8 5  in the last six months  On the contrary  shares of Sysco declined 4 0  in the same time frame 


Estimate Revisions
Upward estimate revisions are indicative of positive investor sentiment about a stock  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sysco has inched up 0 7  for fiscal 2018 and 1 4  for fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days  owing to its solid fourth quarter results  However  the same has gone down 0 3  for fiscal 2017 over the last 30 days for McCormick  reflecting negative outlook on the stock  Encouragingly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 2  for McCormick 
Sysco s earnings for the current fiscal year 2018 ending June 2018 are expected to grow 11 7   while McCormick earnings per share are projected to grow at a lower rate of 7 7  in its current fiscal year 2017 ending November 2017 
Valuation Multiples
Notably  Sysco has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 9  which compares favorably with industry s average of 20 2 and S P 500 average of 19 3  McCormick  on the other hand  has a higher forward PE of 23 4  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Sysco stock in the near term too  as you can see in the chart below  
If we look into another key metric Price Sales ratio  we note that right now  Sysco has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1 9 and S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  On the contrary  McCormick has a P S ratio of 2 7 
The above arguments clearly states that Sysco is better pick investors

Adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 6 5   We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 straight quarters  In the third quarter  adjusted earnings were also 9  higher year over year owing to higher operating income  Further  the favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings were offset by an increase in brand marketing and material costs and currency headwinds 
Revenues and Profits
In the reported quarter the global leader in flavors and spices generated revenues of  1 11 billion  which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 09 billion by 1 4   Revenues grew about 5  from the prior year quarter  despite currency headwinds of 2   Sales were driven by strong base business and impressive product portfolio growth  The acquisitions  Gourmet Garden in Apr 2016 and Enrico Giotti SpA in Dec 2016  also contributed to higher sales by 3  
Product innovation  brand marketing support and expanded distribution as well as pricing actions contributed to the growth in sales  offsetting the negative impact of currency  Excluding currency headwinds  revenues grew 7   driven by both the consumer and industrial segments 
The company s adjusted operating income grew 6 2  to  137 million in the second quarter  On a constant currency basis  it increased 9  due to higher sales and cost savings which were offset by increase in brand marketing expenses and currency headwinds  A shift in the portfolio to more value added products also boosted sales 
Segment Details
Consumer Business  Segment revenues grew 2   primarily driven by strong base business and new product sales compared with the year ago period  Solid performance in the Americas  strong momentum in China and the incremental impact of Gourmet Garden were partially offset by the impact of challenging environments in Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  region  Currency also hurt the segment by 2   Sales rose 2  on a constant currency basis  While Sales increased on a constant currency basis in the Americas and Asia Pacific  it declined in Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  due to weak sales in the U K  where the retail environment suffers from stiff competition 
Adjusted operating income grew 7   on a constant currency basis  driven by the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the impact of higher material costs 
Industrial Business  Industrial segment sales grew 9  despite currency headwinds of 3    Industrial revenues growth was driven by increased sales across all three of its regions  including the incremental impact of the acquisition of Giotti  acquired in Dec 2016  On a constant currency basis  segment sales increased 12  year over year and doubled from the sequential quarter 
On a constant currency basis  adjusted operating income rose 13  year over year  driven by favorable impact of higher sales  product mix and CCI led cost savings  more than offset the unfavorable impact of increases in material costs and an increase in brand marketing McCormick   Company  Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Fiscal 2017 Guidance 
For fiscal 2017  the company has lowered its currency impact on sales  The company now expects sales to grow approximately 4 6  in fiscal 2017  in comparison with  approximately 3 5  announced earlier 
Excluding currency  McCormick has reaffirmed its sales growth and adjusted earnings outlook  The company continues to expect the projected sales growth rate in the range of 5 7   on a constant currency basis  The company expects higher brand marketing  increased pricing  new products  expanded distribution and acquisitions to contribute to the growth  Further  the company anticipates pricing actions to offset an anticipated mid single digit increase in material costs  The company also has plans to achieve approximately  100 million of cost savings 
The company expects 2017 adjusted operating income to grow approximately 8 10   from adjusted operating income of  657 million in 2016  On constant currency basis  adjusted operating income is expected to grow 9 11  
McCormick expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of  4 05  4 13 per share  which marks an increase of 7 9  compared with  3 78 in 2016  The guidance also includes unfavorable currency headwinds of 2 percentage points  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is  4 08 per share  which is within the guidance range 
Our Take
Overall  McCormick is focusing on driving revenues through acquisitions and expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2017  Its cost saving initiative is also appealing  However  earnings growth is likely to be hurt by higher brand marketing expenses 
Share Price Movement
If we look into past six months  performance  McCormick s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  The stock rallied 6 0  against the industry s decline of 5 3

The stocks below are great additions to a portfolio and don t require constant attention  You can buy them with confidence that in the years to come  they will provide you with income through dividends and price appreciation

3 Great Buy And Forget Stocks

 1  Facebook  NASDAQ FB 

When Facebook IPO d  it did so to much fanfare  but with little in the way income  As a result  the stock price sank 
Boy have times changed  Not only does Facebook make an income  it now dominate social media  As proof of this  just look at Snap  NYSE SNAP   Many investors thought it was the next hot stock  but it has floundered as Facebook beats it at its own game 
Currently  Facebook has over 1 billion users and in its latest report saw an 18  increase in user growth 
Looking at the numbers  they tell a great story as well  Earnings per share came in at  1 04  which beat estimates by  0 18  Revenue was at  8 billion  which beat estimates by  200 million  Even more telling  however  is that revenue was up 49  compared to last year 
As Facebook continues to improve its algorithm for advertising  you can expect its revenue numbers to keep rising 

 2  McCormick   Company  NYSE MKC 

McCormick is about as boring as it gets  The spice maker isn t a sexy company and investors won t be seeing huge spikes in the stock price  But that s why it is one of the great buy and forget stocks 
It is a stable company with consistent earnings  In fact  over the past 3  and 10 year periods  the stock has outperformed the S P 500  But most investors wouldn t know this as again  it isn t a sexy stock 
Earnings per share recently came in at  0 82  beating estimates by  0 06  Revenues hit  1 11 billion  which also beat estimates  this time by  10 million  Revenues were up 5  compared to last year 
As I said  nothing sexy here  just a solid company that keeps churning out results year after year 
And while the stock is pricey  you know you are getting solid growth over the long term while taking advantage of a 2  dividend 

 3  Lowe s Companies  NYSE LOW 

Lowe s stock took a pause earlier this year when news hit that new home starts were beginning to slow and the Federal Reserve was planning to start hiking interest rates  But the pullback the stock experienced is not a long term issue as it has many things going for it 
First  even with new home sales slowing  homeowners are still looking to update and improve their existing homes  And that s where Lowe s really shines  In fact  Lowe s is expected to see earnings growth of 15  annually for the next 5 years 
Add as Sears  NASDAQ SHLD  continues to decline  more consumers will flock to both Lowe s and Home Depot  NYSE HD  
When the company recently reported earnings  EPS came in at  1 03  which missed estimates by  0 03  Revenues also missed estimates by  100 million  but revenue was up compared to last year by 11  
While these recent numbers might give some investors pause  I think Lowe s will report excellent earnings numbers in the next quarter 
Add to this the small but solid dividend that Lowe s pays and this is a perfect example of the buy and forget stock 
Final Thoughts

123401,344916,MKC,Tyson Foods  TSN  Recalls Chicken Products On Allergen Risk,opinion,"Per the media  Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   is recalling nearly 2 5 million pounds of ready to eat breaded chicken owing to allergen risk  The possibility of breaded chicken containing milk  which acts as an allergen for many  was identified by a supplier on Jun 6 
Though Tyson Foods had already shipped meat to 30 states  the Springdale  AR based company stated that the products did not reach stores  However  as per the U S  Department of Agriculture  some schools have purchased these products through the company s commercial channels  Thankfully  no cases of illness have been reported till date 
Tyson Foods is the world s largest fully integrated producer  processor and marketer of chicken and poultry based food products  The company supplies value added chicken products through food service  retail grocery stores  club stores and international distribution channels 
The company s dominance in the chicken segment is commendable  However  declines in beef and prepared foods segments have been lowering the profit margins 
The company is planning to reduce costs across the Prepared Foods portfolio by restructuring its manufacturing network  Tyson Foods is also focusing on expanding its protein packed brands as it seeks to divest non protein businesses and focus on growth categories and growth channels  The company has recently acquired AdvancePierre  which will help Tyson Foods to expand its fresh prepared foods offering for both out of home and in home eating occasions 
The company also announced plans to sell three non protein businesses   Sara Lee Frozen Bakery  Kettle and Van s   all part of its Prepared Foods segment  The move is in sync with its strategic focus on protein packed brands 
However  the company is currently facing volume declines and increased costs in the Prepared Foods business  It has thus lowered its expectations for the year to 9  return on sales for the segment  The company expects the same to return to normalized range within fiscal 2018 
Tyson Foods  Beef segment s performance has been dismal of late  Higher domestic availability of fed cattle supplies and lower livestock costs led to the sluggishness in the segment  The company has also decided to reduce its beef production capacity due to lower cattle supply  In fiscal 2017  the company expects fed cattle supplies to increase 6 7  compared with the fiscal 2016 figure Tyson Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Tyson Foods  stock declined 1 4  in the past six months against the industry s 5 4  gain  Notably  the industry is part of the top 43  of the Zacks Classified industries  114 out of the 265   The broader Consumer Staples sector is placed at bottom 31  of the Zacks Classified sectors  11 out of 16

123436,344951,MKC,5 Food Stocks For Healthy Gains On Organic Food Trend,opinion,Major U S  food companies are fighting a tough battle as easy to prepare and ready to eat convenience foods are gradually losing sheen  Consumers would earlier take decisions based on taste  price and convenience  However  the scenario is fast changing  as they are becoming increasingly vigilant toward a new set of factors which are upsetting the consumer value equation  thus creating challenges for the food industry Trends that have gathered steam in the U S  in recent years include a shift toward healthier options in the food sector  predominantly fresh foods  and a high level of price consciousness  Additionally  factors such as growing awareness of  clean label  and genetically modified organism or GMOs  increasing concerns related to sugar consumption and growing demand for free from products are also sketching the food landscape afresh This seismic shift in the U S  food industry is creating hurdles for food behemoths such as General Mills Inc    NYSE GIS    Kellogg Company   NYSE K    Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ    The Kraft Heinz Company   NYSE K    and others  thus making it harder for legacy brands to improve sales These trends are unlikely to stop  That said  despite all these negatives  there are ample reasons to be optimistic about the future in the food industry Healthy Organic Food Drive to Boost SalesFood majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovations as well as strategic acquisitions and divestitures  Additionally  they are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness Given the scenario  demand for organic food continues to grow in the country  Per the recently released report from Organic Trade Association s  OTA s  2017 Organic Industry Survey  the American organic sector stayed on its upward trajectory in 2016  gaining new market share and crushing records  as consumers across the country ate more organic products than ever before Total organic sales were  47 billion in 2016 in the U S   reflecting new sales of nearly  3 7 billion  This comprised  43 billion of organic food sales  the first time the American organic food market has broken the  40 billion mark  Organic food sales increased 8 4  from 2016  significantly surpassing the stagnant 0 6  growth rate in the overall food market  Sales of organic non food products increased 8 8  in 2016  outstripping the overall non food growth rate of 0 8  This growth trend is expected to accelerate in the coming years as food makers are going all out to boost the supply of organic ingredients  as well as increase investment in infrastructure and education Apart from innovations and the drive toward organic ingredients  companies are also pursuing a spate of multi year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings and supporting its key growth strategies  For example  Kraft Heinz has implemented many cost saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC  and Heinz  The company plans to save  1 7 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017  up from  1 5 billion earlier expected   primarily focused on work force reductions along with factory closures and consolidations  As of first quarter 2017  the company realized cumulative savings of approximately  1 3 billion Though the companies  sales have been relatively soft  cost savings have led to better margins  Again  savings are being re invested in the business for innovation  brand building and marketing to stimulate top line growth Stocks to Bet

123472,344987,MKC,Food Stocks  Earnings Slated For Oct 27  PF  BGS  LANC  MJN,opinion,"The Q3 earnings season is in full swing and investors seem to be happy about positive signs of growth after five quarters of back to back declines  In fact  the pace of growth  which is currently slow  is expected to improve further in the coming days 
On summarizing the performance of the 116 S P 500 members that have reported financial results so far  we see that 80 2  of the companies beat earnings and 62 9  surpassed revenue estimates  as per our  report  However  total earnings for these companies were up 0 1  year over year while revenues increased 1 5  
In this scenario  investors are resorting to safe haven stocks and the consumer staples sector appears to be quite reliable 
Overall  the sector has reported modest results this quarter  Lower gas prices  an improving job scenario and increasing consumer confidence have been supporting the improvement in results  Notably  consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   surged for the second consecutive month in September and is now at its highest level since the Great Recession  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path 
In the consumer staples sector  21 9  companies have reported Q3 earnings as of Oct 21  Out of these  85 7  of the companies posted an earnings beat  while 57 1  have surpassed revenue estimates  Total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 2 2  on the back of 1 3  revenue growth and 0 1  higher margins  which might prove to be profitable in the long term 
Food beverage stocks are particularly doing well this earnings season  Leading firms from the industry like McCormick   Company  Inc    NYSE MKC    PepsiCo  Inc    NYSE PEP   and General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS   have delivered better than expected Q3 earnings results despite currency headwinds and the sluggishness in emerging markets 
PepsiCo again reported stellar Q3 results late last month and also raised its full year earnings growth target  McCormick too delivered better than expected results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and raised its financial guidance for fiscal 2016  Last month  General Mills also reported better than expected first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings 
We believe that strong brand portfolio  continuous innovation  cost savings initiatives and acquisitions have cushioned these companies against headwinds  and are expected to remain their strengths 
Let s see what awaits these four food stocks  which are scheduled to release their quarterly numbers on Oct 27 
Pinnacle Foods  Inc    NYSE PF   is slated to report results before the market opens  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5 00   Additionally  it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2 2  in the trailing four quarters 
The manufacturer and distributor of branded food products has an  of 0 00  as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 52 cents  It has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  The company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
Pinnacle Foods actively manages its diverse portfolio of iconic food brands that enjoy strong household penetration in the U S  Also  the company has undertaken several initiatives to reduce costs  coupled with strategic acquisitions to further expand its footprint and boost long term growth  Despite these growth strategies  the company remains apprehensive of incurring higher introductory costs related to product innovation  Moreover  increased consumer marketing investment and currency headwinds are likely to hurt its profits   Read   PINNACLE FOODS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    B G Foods  Inc    NYSE BGS   is slated to release its third quarter 2016 results after the market closes  The company has an Earnings ESP of  15 39  and a Zacks Rank  3  Last quarter  this NJ based shelf stable and frozen food company posted a positive earnings surprise of 23 91   However  the company missed estimates in only one out of the past four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 10 89  
While B G Foods  recent acquisitions have been driving sales  the base business has been hampered by lower volumes and currency headwinds  The company expects base business to remain flat year over year in the second half of 2016   Read    B G FOODS CL A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

    Mead Johnson Nutrition Company   NYSE MJN    which manufactures  distributes  and sells infant formulas  children s nutrition  and other nutritional products  will report its results before the opening bell  This food manufacturer has an Earnings ESP of  2 30  and a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Though the company is focusing on cost reduction measures and lowering its selling  general and administrative expenses  tough global economic environment is expected to hurt the top line  Currency headwinds and weak economic growth in the developing economies of Asia and Latin America are expected to mar the company s performance  We are also disappointed with the company s delay in its foreign trade process last quarter  We believe reduced shipments to Venezuela and requirement for additional product testing prior to import in China will affect the company s forthcoming results as well   Read more

This Illinois based food company posted earnings per share of 70 cents in the third quarter of 2016  Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 9 1  and were way short of the company s guided range of 75 80 cents 
However  earnings declined 18 6  from the year ago level due to lower gross margin related to the acquisition of the Private Brands business  which has a lower margin structure than the legacy TreeHouse business 
 Net sales of  1 59 billion also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 64 billion by 3   However  sales surged 98 7  year over year due to the inclusion of business from the Private Brands acquisition and favorable volume mix  primarily in the North American Retail Grocery segment  partially offset by lower pricing 
All the segments posted strong growth on a year over year basis  North American Retail Grocery segment sales soared 118 5   Sales from the Food Away From Home segment grew 66 4   while that from the Industrial and Export segment was up 16 2  
Gross margin was 18 0  in the third quarter  down 190 basis points from 19 9  last year  The decline was due to lower margin business from the Private Brands acquisition  partially offset by favorable sales mix and lower input costs  
Adjusted EBITDA increased 69 8  to  169 5 million  driven by the inclusion of operating income from the Private Brands acquisition and favorable commodity costs  partially offset by higher costs TREEHOUSE FOODS Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Dismal Outlook
The company expects the lower sales trends to continue in 2016  However  it anticipates margin improvement to persist in 2017 and 2018 as revenues from most of the Private Brands categories will begin to stabilize  TreeHouse remains on track to fully integrate its acquisition of the Private Brands business 
The company lowered its earnings expectations for 2016 due to lower than expected third quarter sales from the Private Brands business  along with expectation of sluggish fourth quarter Private Brands sales 
TreeHouse now expects adjusted earnings to be in a range of  2 80  2 85 per share  down from  3 00  3 10 expected previously 
We note that the company has been struggling with lower margins related to its acquisition of Private Brands  a decision that resulted in plant closures  a lowered annual profit outlook and a reshuffling of TreeHouse s executive ranks 
The company stated it would close a plant in Delta  British Columbia and reduce its manufacturing footprint in Battle Creek  MI  which would impact approximately hundreds of jobs  Both the Battle Creek and Delta facilities were part of the company s acquisition of ConAgra s private brands business 
In addition  the company appointed Matthew Foulston as its chief financial officer  Foulston will join TreeHouse on Dec 2 and replace Dennis Riordan  who announced his retirement in August  Riordan would  however  remain with the company as a president  till it finds a new one after the resignation of Christopher D  Sliva 
Q4 Outlook
The company expects fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be in the range of  1 07  1 12 per share

    Underlying Growth Drivers
Estimates have largely been stable since McCormick delivered better than expected results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 on Sep 30  In fact  the company has been delivering better than expected earnings and revenues for the last four consecutive quarters  During the third quarter  earnings of  1 03 per share grew 21 1  year over year  owing to a favorable tax rate  cost saving initiatives and higher operating income  Revenues grew about 3  from the prior year quarter  driven by acquisitions  The company also raised its guidance for fiscal 2016 driven by strong year to date performance and current projections for the fourth quarter  The company expects higher base business sales  new products  acquisitions and pricing to back the guidance 
McCormick has been witnessing rising demand for spices  herbs and seasonings over the last few years  which is boosting its sales  Product innovation  brand marketing support and expanded distribution  as well as pricing actions also led to sales growth  offsetting the negative impact of material costs and currency 
The company is largely banking on digital marketing to improve its portfolio of spices  to build consumer awareness and drive volume  In 2016  the company plans to increase brand marketing expenses by at least  15 million in 2016  and to take digital marketing to nearly two thirds of its total U S  advertising  up from 46  in 2015 
It is encouraging that McCormick is also focusing on building sales through acquisitions  and expects strong sales momentum to continue in fiscal 2016  McCormick s regular acquisitions have expanded its spices and seasonings portfolio  In the emerging markets too  the company has extended its reach where it has little or no distribution 
Its cost savings initiatives are also appealing  Cost savings through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement   CCI   program has helped the company to focus on reducing costs and enhancing productivity  McCormick expects cost savings in the range of  100  110 million in fiscal 2016  It expects savings of around  400 million by Nov 30  2019 
The stock has a long term earnings per share growth rate of 9 00  and a beta value of 0 47  Further  the stock earns a return on equity of 27 26   better than other companies like Post Holdings  Inc    NYSE POST    Flower Foods  Inc    NYSE FLO   in the same industry space 

We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times  Hence  we suggest investors to hold on to the stock as the rest is a wait and watch story

The main U S  GDP contributor  consumer expenditure accounted for 2 94 percentage points of GDP growth  the highest in more than a year The impressive consumer spending growth has also helped to counter the negative impact of business inventories  It is noteworthy that GDP grew 1 1  in the second quarter  lower than the initial estimate of 1 2   despite the robust consumer spending level due to lower business inventories However  markets were plagued by a number of macroeconomic factors since the beginning of 2016 that have created major volatility in the trading sessions  But fortunes

the S P 500 have improved a respective 6 05  and 6 72  Again  figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  one of Fed s 12 regional banks  may offer some hope  It expects the U S  economy to grow

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Kraft Heinz and 4 Other Surprising Stocks with Momentum

The 4 4  year over year rise in consumer expenditure in the second quarter is something that investors can cheer about  The main U S  GDP contributor  consumer expenditure accounted for 2 94 percentage points of GDP growth  the highest in more than a year 

The impressive consumer spending growth has also helped to counter the negative impact of business inventories  It is noteworthy that GDP grew 1 1  in the second quarter  lower than the initial estimate of 1 2   despite the robust consumer spending level due to lower business inventories 
	However  markets were plagued by a number of macroeconomic factors since the beginning of 2016 that have created major volatility in the trading sessions  But fortunes turned around recently  with improvement in job numbers  rebounding oil prices along with indications of low volatility in the markets by the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   So far this year  the DJI and the S P 500 have improved a respective 6 05  and 6 72  
	Again  figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  one of Fed s 12 regional banks  may offer some hope  It expects the U S  economy to grow at an annualized rate of 3 5  in the third quarter as per the data released on Sep 2  up from 3 2  on Sep 1 
	Importantly  consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   grew during the month of August  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path after a dismal show during the first half of the year  In August  consumer confidence surged to its highest level in 11 months  The  index increased 4 4 points to 101 1  well above the expected level of 97 4 
	Keeping in mind the positive momentum and optimism surrounding economic growth  inflation and the labor market  momentum investing should be a winning strategy for investors seeking higher returns in a short spell  Given an improving labor market and the gradual rise in wages  we expect consumer spending   which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity   to improve Picking the Right Stocks
	Finding the right stocks to invest is always a challenge  It is more so with an uncertain third quarter earnings season around the corner  Although we have enough evidence that the economic picture is likely to improve in the third quarter due to improved residential construction and strong labor market conditions  picking consumer stocks should be a smart choice at this time owing to their defensive nature 
	The Momentum Style Score is an indication of the time to buy a stock to benefit from rising share prices  The highest score is an A  so getting in on an A and out on a B or C could be a strategy for short term gains  For a more in depth understanding  check out our  
	But investors should bear in mind that this is a speculative strategy and not meant for the weak hearted 
	That said  we pair the momentum score with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   which as you know  indicates stocks with high chances of outperforming the market over the next 1 3 months  One of the main factors driving the Zacks Rank is estimate revisions  so stocks with high ranks as well as high momentum scores have even greater chances of short term appreciation 
	Here  we ve picked five consumer staples stocks for momentum investors based primarily on these two factors The Kraft Heinz Company   
	Although this Pittsburgh  PA based packaged food company has been witnessing soft sales in the recent times  cost savings have led to improved margins  mainly in the developed markets of the U S  and Europe  A portion of its savings is also being re invested in the business for innovation  brand building and marketing to stimulate top line growth 
	The company has implemented many cost saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC  and Heinz  Management plans to save  1 5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017  mainly through workforce reductions  factory closures and consolidations  The company has garnered about  535 million of cost savings in the first half 2016  The company is also working for whitespace expansion of the Kraft and Heinz brands in both food services as well as international channels 
	Zacks Rank   2
	Momentum Score   A 
	The company has an expected 3 5 year earnings growth rate of 19 54   The company has been topping expectations in the recent past and has an average four quarter positive surprise of 5 22   What s more  estimates for 2016 and 2017 have jumped a respective 5 5  and 3 1  in the last 60 days  Its share price grew 22 58  year to date Coca Cola Amatil Ltd

123527,345042,MKC,Fuel For The Money Markets Fire,opinion,"Liz McCormick  NYSE MKC  s reporting via Bloomberg gives readers an update on the coming rule changes for money markets   to interested readers 
Two additions may be helpful  First is pricing  Three month LIBOR is 85 basis points  A year ago it was 30  That 55 basis point increase was due only in part to the Fed  They raised rates 25 bps 
The other 30 bps was caused by a widening of risk pricing  Going forward  prime money markets are not going to enjoy the subsidizing effects of holding Treasury bills  They will have to stand on their own  and they may break the buck 
Government money markets will hold the buck under the new rules but will yield roughly the same as the Treasury bills they own  less any cost  They will be riskless for investors 
So the traditional blending of these two approaches will be severed by a clear regulatory wall  And the yields will reflect it  Want safety instead of yield  Use government  Want yield  Use prime and take risk 
After mid October things will settle out and the spread between these two approaches will provide investors with market based pricing of this risk differential  That choice will also allow investors to select an option that avoids some of the recent behavioral revelations of certain infamous banking operations 
We are watching risk pricing carefully  Separately  we expect the forthcoming Senate hearing that will grill a certain bank chairman to be revealing  If he knew  ugh  If he didn t  is his bank too big to manage  And what about the comp levels and retirement packages of those who had oversight 
So  Investors will have clear money market choices with a clear comparison of costs and returns against banks  Meanwhile  both the new rules and the Senate hearing are fuel in this highly incendiary political year

123531,345046,MKC,What s In Store For McCormick   Co   MKC  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"McCormick   Co   Inc    NYSE MKC   is set to report fiscal third quarter 2016 results on Sep 30  before the market opens  Last quarter  this global leader in spices and flavors posted a positive surprise of 1 35  
In fact  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters  making for an average surprise of 1 79  
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement MCCORMICK   CO Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors to Consider
McCormick has been witnessing rising demand for spices  herbs and seasonings over the last few years  Further  its focus on building sales through buyouts has been driving its earnings  Keeping up the trend of acquisitions  in Apr 2016  McCormick acquired Australia based Botanical Food Company  the seller of the Gourmet Garden brand of packaged herbs  Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in chilled convenient packaged herbs  In fact  the company has an optimistic view of the third quarter  owing to recent acquisitions and strong sales momentum 
Further  McCormick has been regularly launching products in order to remain competitive  Its increasing focus on higher pricing and cost savings as well as enhancing productivity through its ongoing initiative   the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement   CCI   program   is also encouraging  As a result  the company has raised its 2016 cost savings target  supported by significant productivity improvements  led by its CCI program 
While the company anticipates strong sales growth and further improvement in gross profit margin  additional brand marketing expenses are likely to hurt earnings growth 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  ESP for McCormick is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 94 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  McCormick has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 
Nu Skin Enterprises  Inc    NYSE NUS    with an Earnings ESP of  1 21  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Ollie s Bargain Outlet Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ OLLI    with an Earnings ESP of  7 14  and a Zacks Rank  2 
General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS    with an Earnings ESP of  1 15  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

123533,345048,MKC,Consumer Staples Stock Outlook   September 2016,opinion,"Will the Recovery in Consumer Staples Stocks Continue 
The consumer staples sector has managed to perform fairly well in the past few months  buoyed by rising consumer confidence and an improving economy 
Consumer Confidence Surges
Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   surged for the second consecutive month in September and is now at its highest level since before the Great Recession  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path  The consumer confidence index  which had increased to 101 8 in August  further improved in September and now stands at 104 1  Additionally  the expectations index improved from 86 1 in August to 87 8  The index surged as consumers expect a positive view of the labor market 
Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fisher is also optimistic about the state of the economy and stated the labor market was extremely close to full employment levels  Given an improving labor market  we expect consumer spending to improve   
Buildup of Bullish Data
Housing data released in August was also encouraging  owing to favorable durable goods and industrial production  Though GDP growth of 1 1  registered in the second quarter of 2016 was a tad lower than the initial estimate of 1 2   but still better than a 0 8  increase recorded in the first quarter  During the second quarter  personal consumption also increased on an annualized basis of 4 4   higher than the rate of 4 2  estimated earlier 
Well  the above discussion raises optimism  but there are indicators that still cast a doubt over the health of the economy 
Factors Raising Concern
The U S  factory sector showed contraction in August  highlighting manufacturers  struggles and a broader drag on the economy from weak business spending and an uncertain global outlook  The U S  service sector index also sank to its lowest level in August in more than six years 
Not only that  but the possibility of a Fed rate hike in December is also unnerving investors  While the possibility of a rate hike in September is now behind us  there are increased expectations for a rate hike in December  though the tussle is still on among the Fed members over when to go for a rate hike due to mixed economic indicators 
But currently  the big market mover is the U S  Presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  A month ago  it looked like Hillary Clinton was leading easily in all the polls  However  recent polling data suggests the race is getting closer and the uncertainty of a winner can make markets jittery 
Though these uncertainties can negatively impact the economy  some indicators also hint that the above mentioned worries are short lived and the economic picture may improve in the third quarter 
Moreover  the recent rebound in oil prices  improving labor market  increase in consumer confidence and a gradual improvement in the housing market are signals that the economy is on a recovery mode  and undoubtedly the consumer staple sector presents itself as a lucrative investment hub

Can Consumer Staples Stocks Fight Global Worries in 2016 

	The traditionally defensive consumer staples sector had a strong start to 2016 and was one of the best performing sectors in the S P 500 in the first quarter amid a moderate economic recovery and improving job market  rising wages  cheaper fuel  improved business and renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery  If we analyze the    consumer staples stocks have outperformed the S P 500 as a whole 

	An interesting fact in the first quarter earnings season was that despite global worries  a bigger proportion of companies came out with positive surprises  for both earnings and revenues  The likely explanation for this development is that either investors were prepared for even weaker results or the guidance for most companies was already lowered to easy to beat levels 

	A number of industry players including The Coca Cola Companies  Inc      McCormick   Company  Inc      PepsiCo Inc      Tyson Foods  Inc       Sysco Corp       among others  posted positive earnings surprises in the March quarter  while a few others missed 

	We also note that consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   has slightly declined in April from a modest gain in March  According to the recent   the Consumer Confidence Index was down to 94 2 in April from the March reading of 96 1  However  the  increased in April  after decreasing in March  It now stands at 128 28  up from 126 42 in March 

	We should keep in mind that the consumer staples sector continues to face headwinds from uncertainty related to the Fed  global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market  Partly offsetting these headwinds is the recent weakening of the U S  dollar  which should help the group s margins in the quarters ahead  Also benefiting the sector is the continued lower commodity and energy costs  which should help boost their profit margins 

Zacks Industry Rank   Positive 

	Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   

	As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  

	The consumer staples sector is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Agricultural Operations  Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft  Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples  Cosmetics   Toiletries  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified  Publishing   Newspapers  Soaps   Cleaning Preparations  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco 

	Quite a few industries are placed in the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  While Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples holds a Zacks Industry Rank  12  Agricultural Operations carries a Zacks Industry Rank  33 and Soaps   Cleaning Preparations holds a Zacks Industry Rank  37  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified and Tobacco also falls in this category with Zacks Industry Rank of  51 and  75  respectively 

	A number of them fall in the middle portion of the pack  with Beverages   Alcohol and Beverages   Soft holding the same Zacks Industry Rank  90  It is followed by Cosmetics   Toiletries and Textile   Apparel  holding ranks of  114 and  165  respectively 

	Only one industry i e  Publishing   Newspapers  with a Zacks Industry Rank  189  comes in the bottom one third 

	Looking at the exact position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is positive  This is because results of most companies were better than expected in the first quarter of 2016  owing to a gradual recovery in the economic environment and cheaper gasoline prices  despite continued concerns over macro economic issues 

Earnings Trends

	With the Q1 earnings season now effectively behind us  total earnings for the sector in the S P 500 were up  2 6  on  4 1  lower revenues  with 83 3  beating EPS estimates and 63 3  coming ahead of top line estimates  This compares to earnings declines of  6 3  on  7 9  lower revenues in the preceding quarter 

	For the second quarter  earnings are expected to decline 4   while revenues are expected to decline 0 9  

	The sector is expected to contribute 6 8  of the total S P 500 income for 2016 and it holds 8 5  market cap weight in the index at present 

	For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our     report 

Bottom Line

	Given the performance of the consumer staples sector in the first quarter  things are looking up at the moment  The positive growth trend is expected to continue going forward  Easing currency pressure will also benefit margins of these stocks in the second half of 2016

123560,345075,MKC,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Procter   Gamble  Molson Coors Brewing  WhiteWave Foods  United Natural Foods And McCormick,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 9  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Consumer Staples  Part 2   including Procter   Gamble Co      Molson Coors Brewing Co      WhiteWave Foods Company     United Natural Foods  Inc     and McCormick  NYSE MKC    Co   Inc      

	Industry  Consumer Staples  Part 2 

	Link  

	Consumer staples stocks rebounded in the first quarter  largely reflecting the group s perceived defensive attributes in an otherwise uncertain global macroeconomic and market backdrop 

	Parts of the U S  economy have actually held up fairly nicely despite the aggregate growth picture remaining sub par  with GDP growth in the first quarter barely remaining in positive territory  A steadily improving labor market  notwithstanding recent weakness  and gains in wages have helping consumer spending trends  A number of retailers and fast food chains have hiked wages 

	As a result  market experts believe the economy is strong enough to face headwinds such as worries stemming from China and other emerging markets and Fed rate uncertainty 

	Consumer staples companies typically have tight margins  and a reduction in energy prices over the last two years is helping companies to lower costs  Going forward  consumer staples companies will continue to benefit from decreasing commodity costs and lower energy costs  which will help improve profit margins  The recent weakening of U S  dollar is also expected to boost profits 

	Apart from this  let s discuss some of the key factors that have been driving consumer staples stocks since the past few quarters  despite global worries and also have the potential to boost earnings in the near term 

OPPORTUNITIES

Innovations

	In a crowded and competitive space  consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions and to remain successful  In fact  companies with innovative products in their pipeline will be in a position to benefit 

	Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter   Gamble Co       P G believes that consistent product innovation  supported by strong marketing and commercialization  will help deliver stronger results over the long term 

	Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co     has also been launching new products to boost revenues and market share  which help it to offset the impact of declining volumes  Molson Coors also invests in marketing and advertising to create brand awareness 

Transition to Health and Wellness and  Good for You  Products

	Consumer staples companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness  rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressure 

	Natural and organic food beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company    and United Natural Foods  Inc     have been benefiting from strong demand for natural organic food products and expect the trend to continue 

	The global leader in spices and seasonings  McCormick   Co   Inc      is also reshuffling its portfolio to increase the amount of organic herbs and spices amid the rising demand for organic food products  It now plans to ramp up its organic and non GMO offerings by 2016

123566,345081,MKC,What s In Store For McCormick   Co   MKC  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"McCormick   Co   Inc   NYSE MKC   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jun 30  before the market opens  Last quarter  this global leader in spices and flavors posted a positive surprise of 7 25  
In fact  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters  making for an average surprise of 4 02  MCCORMICK   CO Price and EPS Surprise   Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
McCormick has been witnessing rising demand for spices  herbs and seasonings over the last few years  Further  its focus on building sales through acquisitions has been driving its earnings  Keeping up the trend of acquisitions  in Apr 2016  McCormick acquired Australia based Botanical Food Company  the seller of the Gourmet Garden brand of packaged herbs  Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in chilled convenient packaged herbs  In fact  the company has an optimistic view of the second quarter  owing to recent acquisitions and strong sales momentum 
Further  McCormick has also been regularly launching new products in order to remain competitive  Its increasing focus on higher pricing and cost savings and enhancing productivity through its ongoing initiative  the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement   CCI   program is also encouraging 
However  earnings per share in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to be slightly below adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents in the second quarter of 2015  While the company anticipates strong sales growth and further improvement in gross profit margin  additional brand marketing expenses in the second quarter  along with an increase in the tax rate will likely hurt earnings growth 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  ESP for McCormick is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 74 cents per share 
Zacks Rank   McCormick has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 
Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   with an Earnings ESP of  0 86  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Nu Skin Enterprises  Inc    NYSE NUS   with an Earnings ESP of  2 60  and a Zacks Rank  1

123573,345088,MKC,McCormick  MKC  Beats Q2 Earnings By A Penny  Revenue In Line,opinion,"McCormick   Co   NYSE MKC   is a global leader in spices  seasonings  specialty foods and flavors  The company has a strong brand portfolio and owns more than 250 brands that are sold in the U S  and in international markets 
McCormick s strong portfolio and leading brands are consistently helping it to achieve strong growth  McCormick has been witnessing rising demand for spices  herbs and seasonings over the last few years  Further  its focus on building sales through brand marketing investments and acquisitions have been driving earnings 
McCormick has also been regularly launching new products in order to remain competitive  Its increasing focus on higher pricing and cost savings and enhancing productivity through its ongoing initiative  the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement   CCI   program is also encouraging  However  sluggishness in the industrial segment due to weak demand from quick service restaurants remains a concern  Due to this  investors are eagerly awaiting McCormick s earnings report 
Investors should also note that the recent earnings estimate revisions for MKC are stable and remain unchanged over the past 30 days period  Interestingly  MKC has a positive history in earnings season  as MKC has delivered positive surprise in three of the last four quarters  making for an average surprise of 4 02  
Currently  MKC has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but that could definitely change following McCormick s earnings report which was just released  We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just revealed announcement below 
Earnings  MKC s earnings of 75 cents beat our consensus of 74 cents per share  Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses 
Revenue  MKC posted revenues of  1 063 billion  This was almost in line with our consensus estimate of  1 060 billion 
Key Stats to Note  McCormick s sales grew 7  on a constant currency basis  driven by acquisition benefits and higher volumes and product mix

123598,345113,MKC,Company Notes Digest October 2 2015,opinion,"Each week we read dozens of transcripts from earnings calls and presentations as part of our investment process  Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts 
The Macro Outlook 
The auto industry had another strong month
 industry SAAR that we would expect to be around 18 million This would mean that then the total vehicle industry was likely up about 13  in September We view the September s industry performance as another strong sales month it was good from beginning to end one of those really special strong months      Automobiles 
Vail Resorts isn t seeing any softening of demand 
 I mean again at this point  we are not seeing any softening in consumer interest we are not seeing that in our bookings or in our pass sales      Ski Resorts 
Paychex  NASDAQ PAYX  is still seeing steady hiring among small businesses
 we re seeing continued   particularly in the small business under 50  we re seeing continued better employment growth than prerecession levels of 2004 and so   and it s down a little bit from last year  but it s consistently above that level  So we re feeling like a steady improvement in small business formation and employment hiring     Payroll Processing 
Valuations are still high  but maybe this correction will help create acquisition targets
 I think it s a tough market  I think everybody says that  it s a tough market  Valuations are high but maybe that could change with this current ongoing correction  who knows but I think it is a difficult market but we are looking for things that fit our profile      Packaged Foods 
Inventory cycles eventually work themselves out
 I think the buying side of the market has been a little conservative in terms of how they procured PC parts over the last three to six months and I think it s at this point  this could be interesting to watch how the next three or four months plays out in terms of the consumer and corporate behavior  because at some point they are going to start to replenish      Electronic Components 
International 
Companies will probably revise FX impact higher this quarter
 FX obviously is a large headwind on a reported basis it s gotten slightly worse on the operating income line as we ve upped the negative impact on the total company to 4  versus the prior three      Spices 
Putin assured the UN that Russia has no ambitions for world domination
 I must note that such an honest and frank approach of Russia has been recently used as a pretext to accuse it of its growing ambitions  as if those who say it have no ambitions at all  However  it s not about Russia s ambitions  dear colleagues  but about the recognition of the fact that we can no longer tolerate the current state of affairs in the world  What we actually propose is to be guided by common values and common interests  rather than ambitions      President of Russia 
Financials 
Some parts of the lodging industry may be battling over supply
 I think one of the benefits that we have obviously is other parts of the travel industry one of the things they are struggling with is not just the demand side  but the supply side  And so as people build new rooms obviously that starts to bring down some of their metrics and one of the benefits we have right now is that there has not been any new supply added to the mountain resort industry     Ski Resorts 
Consumer 
Organic ingredients are fundamentally more expensive to produce
 raw material themselves are undeniably more expensive than regular spices and that s reflected in the premium price that organic products command in the market place  It s not just a scarcity issue  it costs more money to produce organic ingredients and products     Spices 
Retail has gotten increasingly competitive in the last five years
 you re absolutely right the competition is certainly more intense than it was four or five years ago with some smaller chains rolling out nationally and the pure e com players that you referenced So listen you ve got to be   in this sort of environment you got to be on your game all the time  Your product has to be spot on  your marketing has to be spot on     Home Furnishing 
Established retailers really want to believe that physical stores are a competitive advantage
 the physical stores remain central to serving our customers and provide us a tremendous opportunity to be close to them  The ability to consult with our knowledgeable and solutions oriented sales associates coupled with our in store services  encourage customers to visit and spend time in our stores  Options such as reserve online  pickup in store  buy online and return to store and online appointment scheduling highlight various points of interactions we have with our customers across our channels      Home Furnishing 
Pier One said that its operating level margins from e commerce sales are higher than in store sales
 I think what we have said consistently Denise  is that the contribution from operations level or fulfilled sales has a higher margin than the store sale     Home Furnishing 
Costco  NASDAQ COST  hopes that there s room for everyone
 There is room for all of us  We ve got to keep  it s a big play out there in terms of market share and we think that we ll be able to take our share of that  Some little departments you lose a little  others you make a little  certainly we want people to still come into our warehouses      Warehouse Retail 
Technology 
PC Markets are weak  but a recovery wouldn t take much
 Well I think the PC is about where it s been  I can t advertise there s been a major uptick in PC demand  The only data point that I would say that is new for us is that as we sit today the relative channel inventory in PCs is not a huge burden to a recovery      Electronic Components 
Blackberry s CEO feels like he has stabilized the company but now needs to stabilize revenue
 Remember  we all said about a year ago  we were talking about stabilizing the company  the business  and focusing on cash flow from operation  I think we have accomplished that  This year  as we said  we re going to stabilize the revenue  and unfortunately  we have a really low point here      Feature phones 
Materials  Industrials  Energy 
IHS expects energy customers to make modest budget cuts in 2016
 There are some smaller players in the U S  upstream that will be under pressure  but we do think most of the big companies have made most of their cost reductions and the IOCs and major independents are in the process  while they re in the process of deciding their capital budgets for 2016 and we expect some modest trimming      Consultant 
Electric utilities have not added much capacity this cycle
 The electric utility market in the U S  remains sluggish but we have benefited from strong international opportunities and a solid backlog      Electrical Equipment 
It is really difficult to be a small manufacturer in a down cycle
 We are still noticing that the dealers are struggling as well and they are definitely not wanting to stock any of our inventory  So we do anticipate that the sales that we have  we need to have inventory on hand in order to capitalize on those sales      Farm Equipment

123599,345114,MKC,Top Trade Ideas For The Week November 30  2015  MKC,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
McCormick  N MKC   is looking to spice things up into the holidays  The spice company has been in a rising trend since October 2014 as shown by its ability to stay above the 200 day SMA and continue higher  4 times over this period the 200 day SMA has acted as support 
Heading into next week the stock is pressing against resistance at 86 for the third time  The first two led to pullbacks  The price action is building an expanding wedge and a break to the upside would target a move to 94 40  There is a Deep Crab harmonic as well that has a Potential Reversal Zone  PRZ  at 91 15 above 
The momentum indicators also point higher  The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is crossed up and rising  There is resistance here at 86 and then free air above  Support lower comes at 85 20 and 83 55 followed by 82 30 and 81 60  Short interest is elevated at 6 2  
Checking the options open interest sees the biggest size in December at 85 on the Call side and then 90  But on the Put side there is comparable open interest at the 75 strike  It is notable that most open interest is below the current price  In January there is little open interest  and it is still building in March  post the January 28th expected earnings report  but also mainly lower than the current price 
The chart points up and the options point down 
McCormick   Company Incorporated  N MKC 
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 86 10 with a stop at 85 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock over 86 10 with a March 80 85 90 Put Spread Collar  collar at 65 cents  
Trade Idea 3  Buy the December 85 Calls  offered at  2 05 late Friday  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the January 85 90 Call Spread   2 25  
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into December sees the equity markets looking solid and maybe with new leadership 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil builds a bear flag in its longer downtrend  The US Dollar Index is breaking out to multi year highs while US Treasuries consolidate with a short term bias higher  The Shanghai Composite broke consolidation to the downside and may be resuming the downtrend  while Emerging Markets are moving lower after failing at resistance

123600,345115,MKC,MKC  A Flavorful Dividend Growth Investment,opinion,"McCormick   Company  N MKC  has increased its dividend for 30 consecutive years and paid uninterrupted dividends since 1925 
While the stock s current dividend yield is just 2   it has recorded a double digit total return over each of the last 1   5   10  and 20 year periods  Very few companies have managed to create such consistent value for shareholders 
We are evaluating this excellent business for potential inclusion in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewMCK manufactures and distributes spices  seasoning mixes  condiments  and other flavorful products to the entire food industry   retail outlets  food manufacturers  and foodservice businesses  The company was established in 1889 and incorporated in 1915  Some of MCK s leading brands include McCormick  Lawry s  Club House  Zatarain s  Thai Kitchen  and Simply Asia 
MKC has two business segments   consumer  60  of sales  80  of operating income  and industrial  40  of sales  20  of operating income  
The consumer business sells spice  herb and regional favorite brands  The industrial business sells to nine of the top 10 global food and beverage companies and nine of the top 10 foodservice and restaurant chains  Its flavor solutions include snack seasonings  sandwich sauces  and branded foodservice products 
By geography  the U S  is MKC s largest market  55  of sales   followed by China  including joint ventures  22  of MKC s sales are from emerging markets   The company has brands in more than 135 countries around the world Business AnalysisMKC s business is driven by its strong portfolio of brands  continuous product innovation  marketing investments  and gradual expansion into new product categories and geographies with organic growth and acquisitions 
The company s history dates back to the 19th century  building up over 100 years of customer recognition of its iconic brands  Today  MKC is four times the size of its next largest global competitor and approximately 60  of MKC s consumer sales are from brands that have number one market share positions in their categories  The McCormick brand is also ranked fifth overall on the Digital IQ Index of 114 food brands 
To reinforce its dominant market position  MKC invests heavily in branding  The company spent over  225 million on brand marketing support costs  over 5  of sales  and  100 million on advertising  2 3  of sales  in 2014  Smaller players or new entrants have a hard time competing for mindshare with consumers because of the substantial investments MKC makes to maintain its brand image 
Beyond branding  MKC invests in product innovation to keep its lineup fresh and relevant  Many of its products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by its research laboratories and product development teams  MKC spent over  60 million on R D in 2014 and has 18 innovation centers around the world 
As a result of its focus on innovation  approximately 8 10  of MKC s annual sales are from products launched over the last three years  The company is also staying relevant with e commerce distribution and was named supplier of the year for  Grocery  by Amazon  O AMZN  
Thanks to its strengths in branding and product innovation  many of MKC s customer relationships have been active for decades  The company s range of products is one of the broadest in the industry and also covers practically every price point  keeping MKC relevant regardless of the customer s needs  Breaking up these relationships is no small feat for new entrants 
MKC is also able to harness its global distribution network to efficiently leverage its acquisitions  Some of the major acquisitions MKC has made over the last 15 years include Stubb s barbeque  2015   Lawry s  2008   Simply Asia  2006   and Zatarain s  2003   These deals provide MKC with new products and markets to continue the company s growth 
With almost an endless number of flavor categories  MKC can continue building its global growth platforms through acquisitions over the years 
Altogether  MKC targets long term sales growth of 4 6   including acquisitions  and earnings per share growth of 9 11  per year  The company has been remarkably consistent in achieving these goals throughout history  and we expect more of the same going forward Key RisksFrom time to time  MKC s business must put up with currency headwinds and raw material cost volatility  e g  the price of agricultural products is impacted by weather and harvest conditions   but we don t view these issues as threats to the company s long term earnings power 
Issues that could structurally impact MKC s future are changes in consumer tastes  increased competition from private label and smaller brands  a botched acquisition  or the loss of a large customer  Wal Mart  N WMT  and Pepsi  accounted for 22  of MKC s 2014 sales  
Regarding consumer health trends  it s no new news that organic  natural  and healthier products are taking more shelf space at almost every retailer  Consumers are reading more labels and want to know what exactly they are putting in their bodies 
MKC seems to face less risk than other incumbents because spices and herbs are not generally perceived to be health concerns with consumers  If anything  they are viewed as good things to consume and can even serve as substitutes for sodium 
MKC is also investing to combat this risk and expects over 70  of McCormick brand spices  herbs  and extracts in the U S  will be non GMO  About 80  of its premium gourmet lines will be organic in 2016 as well 
The threat posed from lower priced private label products and new brands is likely a bigger concern  MKC has demonstrated excellent pricing power over time  but this has also created a sizable gap in price between its spices and herbs and those sold under private labels  MKC does have its own private label line of products  but it is a small proportion of overall sales  Hopefully the company s brand recognition and predictable flavor tastes are enough to hold market share against lower priced options  but we will keep our eye on volume trends 
Finally  it s worth pointing out that Wal Mart  11  of 2014 sales  and PepsiCo  N PEP   11   are major customers for MKC  We believe MKC s products have strong staying power with these customers because of their brand recognition and quality  but that doesn t mean a customer like Wal Mart won t try to squeeze MKC harder on pricing Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
MKC s dividend is about as safe as they come with a Safety Score of 99  The company has paid dividends every year since 1925 and has many attractive characteristics  starting with its payout ratios 
As seen below  MKC s earnings payout ratio has remained around 40  over the last decade  and its free cash flow payout ratio has hovered around a similar level  These are very healthy figures that provide MKC plenty of flexible to continue paying and growing its dividend over the years Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Beyond payout ratios  understanding how a business performed during the last recession is also helpful in assessing the safety of its dividend  Operating in the consumer staples industry  it s not surprising to see a strong performance by MKC  The company s sales were about flat in fiscal year 2009  and its free cash flow actually grew  MKC s stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 23  in 2008  This is clearly a recession resistant business Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Like other high quality dividend growth stocks  we can see that MKC has been a free cash flow machine  Rising free cash flow lets MKC steadily raise its dividend and pursue acquisitions to expand its product line and geographical reach  MKC was even able to grow its free cash flow per share each year during the financial crisis  It doesn t get much safer than that Source  Simply Safe Dividends
MKC has created significant value for shareholders  earning a double digit return on invested capital each of its last 10 fiscal years  Its profitability was also very stable throughout the last recession  These are often the signs of a blue chip dividend stock that enjoys several competitive advantages  which we believe MKC does Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Looking at the balance sheet  MCK carries a significant amount of debt   1 billion  compared to its cash on hand   108 million   However  the consistency of the company s free cash flow generation and slow changing nature of its end markets reduces MKC s balance sheet risk  The company also received a nice  A2  credit rating from Moody s in 2015 Source  Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
MKC s dividend growth potential is very strong with a Growth Score of 73  The company is a dividend aristocrat and has raised its dividend for 30 consecutive years  including an 8  boost in November 2015  As seen below  MKC has grown its dividend at about a 9  annual rate over the last 5  and 10 year periods Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Going forward  we expect dividend growth to continue at a similar pace  MKC s objective is to maintain an earnings payout ratio of 40   which is about where the company is at today  In other words  future dividend growth needs to align with earnings growth  which management expects to be 9 11  per year  to keep the payout ratio constant ValuationMKC trades at about 23x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2    which is about in line with its five year average dividend yield 
However  this is a wonderful business that has increased its total shareholder return at a double digit rate over the past 1   5   10   and 20 year periods  an amazing accomplishment 
While currency headwinds and raw material cost volatility could impact earnings over the near term  we believe the company is capable of growing its earnings at a high single digit rate for at least the next five years  If this scenario plays out  MKC appears to offer 9 11  annual total return potential ConclusionFew companies have demonstrated the consistency that MKC has over the last 100 years  The company s dividend safety and growth prospects are excellent  and the business should benefit over time from competing in slow changing  steadily growing markets  There s really not much to dislike about MKC  other than its valuation ",2016-01-28,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mkc:-a-flavorful-dividend-growth-investment-382180,382180
123601,345116,MKC,Yellen Comments Give Stocks A Lift,opinion,"U S  stocks finished higher  getting a boost on comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen in her speech to the Economic Club of New York  while a decline in crude oil prices tempered the gains in the energy sector  Treasuries and gold got a lift from Yellen s comments  while the U S  dollar accelerated to the downside  Meanwhile  equity headlines consisted of some better than expected earnings reports  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  rose 98 points  0 6   to 17 633  the S P 500 Index added 18 points  0 9   to 2 055  while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 80 points  1 8   to 4 847  In moderately heavy volume  969 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 8 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil fell  1 11 lower to  38 28 per barrel  wholesale gasoline was  0 02 lower at  1 48 per gallon and the Bloomberg gold spot price jumped  19 24 to  1 240 95 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 9  lower at 95 11 
Lennar Corp   NYSE LEN  48  reported fiscal 1Q earnings per share  EPS  of  0 63  above the  0 52 FactSet estimate  as revenues rose 21 3  year over year  y y  to  2 0 billion  versus the expected  1 9 billion  The homebuilder said it continues to believe that the housing market is continuing its slow and steady recovery driven by years of under production  tight inventory levels  attractive interest rates and the lowest unemployment levels since 2008  LEN was higher 
McCormick   Co   NYSE MKC  99  posted fiscal 1Q EPS ex items of  0 74  compared to the projected  0 69  with revenues increasing 2 0  y y to  1 0 billion  roughly in line with expectations  The company forecasted slightly lower y y 2Q earnings  and offered roughly in line full year profit guidance  while noting that it expects a lower impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  Shares finished nicely higher 
Consumer Confidence improves  Yellen stresses caution in speech 
The Consumer Confidence Index rose to 96 2 in March from the upwardly revised 94 0 level in February  where the Bloomberg estimate called for it to remain  Sentiment toward the present situation declined compared to the prior month  while expectations of business conditions rose  On employment  the labor differential consumers  appraisal of jobs being  plentiful  minus being  hard to get  decreased to  1 2 from the  0 8 posted last month 
The 20 city composite S P Case Shiller Home Price Index showed a gain in home prices of 5 8  y y in January  versus the Bloomberg expectation of a 5 7  rise  Month over month  m m   home prices were higher by 0 8  on a seasonally adjusted basis for January  above forecasts of a 0 7  increase 
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen delivered her speech to the Economic Club of New York  where she pointed out that the Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  projections for economic growth  unemployment  and inflation are little changed from its estimates that accompanied its monetary policy decision earlier this month  The March decision reminded us that the FOMC continues to be a bit more hawkish than the market  but appeared to be more dovish than the market was expecting 
Yellen added that she considers it appropriate for the FOMC to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy   This caution is especially warranted because  with the federal funds rate so low  the FOMC s ability to use conventional monetary policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric   the Fed Chair stressed  As Brad points out in the above article  the Fed wants to  normalize  policy  but of course remain data dependent  and international developments will likely have a large impact on their ability to move toward that goal  Inflation has ticked higher  but economic growth remains modest  meaning the Fed will continue to try to be gradual in their approach  But given the disconnect with the market  and the divergent global central bank policies  financial market volatility is likely to continue 
Treasuries added to gains on Yellen s comments to finish higher  as the yield on the 2 year note fell 9 basis points  bps  to 0 78   the yield on the 10 year note declined 8 bps to 1 81   while the 30 year bond rate lost 6 bps to 2 60

Europe shows late day resiliency in return to action  Asia mixed
European equities overcame early sluggishness to finish mostly higher  with the region returning to action following the extended Easter holiday weekend  while data in the region was on the light side  However  conviction was likely contained as the global markets awaited today s speech by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen  and weaker oil prices pressured the energy sector  The euro ticked higher versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region lost ground  In economic news  Italian consumer confidence unexpectedly improved for March  while a separate read on the nation s business confidence for this month missed expectations 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed with traders likely moving cautiously ahead of today s speech by Fed Chair Yellen  while markets in Australia and Hong Kong returned to action following the long Easter holiday weekend  Japanese equities declined  with a majority of stocks trading for the first time after being adjusted for their next dividend payments  per Bloomberg  Stocks found some support from some late day weakness in the yen and an unexpected rise in Japan s overall household spending for February  However  separate reports showed the nation s jobless rate surprisingly ticked higher and retail sales dropped more than expected for last month 
With recent moves to tighten property purchase rules by some major cities continuing to weigh on real estate issues  mainland Chinese stocks fell  while those traded in Hong Kong ticked only slightly higher  Elsewhere  weakness in financials pressured Australian stocks  but South Korean listings advanced  while  India s markets declined ahead of Yellen s speech and next week s monetary policy decision from the Reserve Bank of India  which is expected to cut some of its benchmark lending rates by 25 bps 
Tomorrow s international economic calendar will be busy  with reports set to be released to include  industrial production and trade data from Japan  the trade balance from China  confidence numbers from the eurozone  and CPI from Germany

123603,345118,MKC,March Jobs Report Soothes Market s Interest Rate Fears,opinion,"As March ends each year  the birds start to chirp a little louder with the onset of spring  Flowers bloom  allergies perk up  the sun gets a little warmer  and the cold days of winter seem to fade from memory  In many places  with the transition to a more pleasant environment comes some improvement in the general mood  Nowhere would the preceding description be more apt than in the capital markets  Yesterday  the March jobs report showed 215 thousand jobs were created during the month  topping the 205k estimate  The unemployment rate did pick up a bit to 5 0   and as the corporate earnings period begins in earnest a few weeks from now  all eyes will turn towards profit reports to see what the bottom line brings for public companies  Tax time is also upon us  and it is always such a pleasure to write the check to the IRS as I know everyone enjoys this special act  Lots to look forward to  eh 
Anyway  Janet Yellen certainly must be happy  as her preferred policy approach  lower for longer  will probably remain in tact for quite a while  Fed funds futures now seem to price in only one interest rate hike for the rest of 2016  If corporate profits disappoint in the next few weeks as many believe they will  there will be even less pressure on the Fed head to return back to  normalization  
Dollar weakness has been the result  helping commodities  emerging markets and anything energy related  not to mention the stock market  The first quarter was essentially one of two stories for domestic stocks  The first six weeks were abysmal  and the last six were equally wonderful  In sum  it kind of followed the seasonal pattern of a difficult winter transitioning into a comfortable spring  that is the game plan anyway   As you well know  it could have been much worse 
On the earnings and deal front  the biggest news came from the hotel area  where it appears Marriot  NASDAQ MAR  will indeed wind up acquiring Starwood  NYSE HOT   Dave   Buster s  NASDAQ PLAY  reported earnings which topped estimates  proving again how wonderful the food and gaming business can be when done correctly  McCormick  NYSE MKC  met estimates  which is nothing new as the spice seller has been a consistent performer for decades  Blackberry  TO BB  missed the target in the latter part of the week and is a fine example of how difficult the technology area is when the market has shifted and a company has to change its strategy and products 
The energy sector was yet again front and center with the fall from grace of Sunedison  NYSE SUNE   Valued at  10 billion as late as July of last year  it appears the company will file for bankruptcy this weekend  Whenever the SEC and Justice department question cash levels along with accounting issues  you have to know the circumstances are not good  Piling up  7 9 billion dollars of debt without the assets and cash flow to pay for it also did not help the cause  Oil heading dramatically lower certainly did not help either  The familiar pattern of an enterprise running into trouble because of aggressive assumptions versus entrenched competitors  and taking on way too much relative to the underlying business  renders a promising company at the mercy of its creditors  The lesson to learn for investors is to understand the level and maturity of the respective debt obligations of any leveraged entity 
In the political world  both parties are enduring the back half of the nominating process  with the frontrunners facing stiff competition from intra party rivals  Bernie Sanders continues to pressure Hillary Clinton to spend more money  and crazy Donald continues to hurt his own prospects for the nomination by  well  being the guy he has always been  Republicans are now waking up to the reality of how unprepared he is to be the party nominee  In this light  Mr  Cruz and Mr  Kasich seem like pretty good alternatives as a contested convention looms

123604,345119,MKC,Consumer Staples Stock Outlook   June 2016,opinion,"Can Consumer Staples Stocks Fight Global Worries in 2016 
The traditionally defensive consumer staples sector had a strong start to 2016 and was one of the best performing sectors in the S P 500 in the first quarter amid a moderate economic recovery and improving job market  rising wages  cheaper fuel  improved business and renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery  If we analyze the   consumer staples stocks have outperformed the S P 500 as a whole 
An interesting fact in the first quarter earnings season was that despite global worries  a bigger proportion of companies came out with positive surprises  for both earnings and revenues  The likely explanation for this development is that either investors were prepared for even weaker results or the guidance for most companies was already lowered to easy to beat levels 
A number of industry players including The Coca Cola Companies  Inc   KO   McCormick   Company  NYSE MKC   Inc   MKC   PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  Inc   PEP   Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   Inc   TSN   Sysco Corp  NYSE SYY    SYY   Altria Group  NYSE MO   Inc   MO  and TreeHouse Foods  Inc   THS  posted positive earnings surprises in the March quarter  while a few others like Philip Morris International  NYSE PM   Inc   PM  and Boston Beer  Inc   SAM  missed on earnings 
We also note that consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   has slightly declined in April from a modest gain in March  According to the recent   the Consumer Confidence Index was down to 94 2 in April from the March reading of 96 1  However  the  increased in April  after decreasing in March  It now stands at 128 28  up from 126 42 in March 
We should keep in mind that the consumer staples sector continues to face headwinds from uncertainty related to the Fed  global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market  Partly offsetting these headwinds is the recent weakening of the U S  dollar  which should help the group s margins in the quarters ahead  Also benefiting the sector is the continued lower commodity and energy costs  which should help boost their profit margins 
Zacks Industry Rank   Positive 
Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   
As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  
The consumer staples sector is further sub divided into the following industries at the expanded level  260 industry groups   Agricultural Operations  Beverages   Alcohol  Beverages   Soft  Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples  Cosmetics   Toiletries  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified  Publishing   Newspapers  Soaps   Cleaning Preparations  Textile   Apparel and Tobacco 
Quite a few industries are placed in the top 1 3rd of the 260  industry groups  While Consumer Products   Miscellaneous Staples holds a Zacks Industry Rank  12  Agricultural Operations carries a Zacks Industry Rank  33 and Soaps   Cleaning Preparations holds a Zacks Industry Rank  37  Food   Miscellaneous Diversified and Tobacco also falls in this category with Zacks Industry Rank of  51 and  75  respectively 
A number of them fall in the middle portion of the pack  with Beverages   Alcohol and Beverages   Soft holding the same Zacks Industry Rank  90  It is followed by Cosmetics   Toiletries and Textile   Apparel  holding ranks of  114 and  165  respectively 
Only one industry i e  Publishing   Newspapers  with a Zacks Industry Rank  189  comes in the bottom one third 
Looking at the exact position of these industries  one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is positive  This is because results of most companies were better than expected in the first quarter of 2016  owing to a gradual recovery in the economic environment and cheaper gasoline prices  despite continued concerns over macro economic issues 
Earnings Trends
With the Q1 earnings season now effectively behind us  total earnings for the sector in the S P 500 were up  2 6  on  4 1  lower revenues  with 83 3  beating EPS estimates and 63 3  coming ahead of top line estimates  This compares to earnings declines of  6 3  on  7 9  lower revenues in the preceding quarter 
For the second quarter  earnings are expected to decline 4   while revenues are expected to decline 0 9

Lessons Learned
All traders interpret the markets differently  One of the things about the New World Trading Order is that nothing stays the same for long  Whether it s MrTopStep pointing out the return of Mutual Fund Monday or the late Friday Rip or a hot indicator  by the time Joe Public gets on it the trade is already used up 
The largest pattern and one that has remained dominant is the overall direction of the S P  In the MrTopStep trading room yesterday I pointed out several reasons why I did not think the S P was going down  My first reason  one I didn t mention  was simply because most people thought the S P was going lower  The S P has a long history of breaking hearts 
Below are some of the excerpts from the room after the ESU14 rallied early and started selling off again and was trading at the 1942 50 43 00 level 

09 17 03 TRADINGDATA2   driley  I know that  everyone  is bearish and that they expect the ES to sell off  I dont think that way 09 19 20 TRADINGDATA2   driley  First  we just had two down days in a row  we don t get one down day very often and two is a rarity 09 20 52 TRADINGDATA2   driley  Expect two way flow with a buy side bias going into the end of the 2Q 09 26 29 TRADINGDATA2   driley  Do not forget  thin to win  next week is a short week  early Thursday close and close on Friday for the 4th of July 09 34 42 TRADINGDATA2   driley  Chance Stroot  09 30 00  ES has not been down 3 days in a row since late Jan 03 00 40 TRADINGDATA2   driley  they just PUNISH the shorts  03 02 51 TRADINGDATA2   driley  I called it all the way up Bull 03 03 09 TRADINGDATA2   driley  I said stops 49 to 53 03 03 14 PITBULL  YUP GOOD JOB

I know that it s sometimes its hard to separate the bushes from the woods  I don t pretend to have all the answers but every time I see the S P sell off and the bears jump back in I know that it s just a matter of time until the S P levels off  back and fills and starts going back up 
I m not your chart guy  I m your feel guy  While I may not have gotten the traders in the room to go long  maybe  just maybe  I kept them from shorting at a critical level  the lows of the day  Compare the above with the time and sales data to see for yourself what we were saying in the Trading Room  Remember it s US Central Time

Vacation Time
Our view  The E mini S P  CME ESU14  opened lower  rallied and then sold off a couple points and then chopped between 1945 and 1947 for a good share of the mid morning trade  To me that means  back and fill  and that means the market is going back up 
I am not 100  sure how the end of the quarter will go  I still believe there is an upward bias  but if it happens to sell off again   I highly doubt it  then the ESU will go back up next week 
After the June Quadruple Witching and the the Q2 rebalance it s going to be vacation time  Obviously  we have already seen part of that as the colleges and schools let out for the summer  but it s going to be much more prevalent next week when the CME closes early on Thursday and is closed on Friday for the 4th of July

123640,345155,MKC,Company Notes Digest  Unexpected  Inflation  Retailers Sacrificing ,opinion,"The Macro Outlook
Inflation was a hot topic this week
 We ve seen a shift from historical patterns of deflation in generic drug cost to inflation in some cases these increases have been significant we didn t quite anticipate it This was really kind of snuck up I think on the industry and us    Walgreen Co  NYSE WAG 
 Input cost inflation was a bit above our forecast    General Mills Inc  NYSE GIS  
 There is some upward cost inflation specifically in commodities like pepper and vanilla and we re working with our CCI programs to help to try to offset those    McCormick   Company Incorporated  NYSE MKC  
While the inflation was somewhat unexpected  companies tended to downplay it
 Wouldn t say it s all around the drug inflation    WAG 
 We also of course are seeing some moderating dairy inflation we re encouraged by what we are seeing on that front we  are modeling  3  inflation as you know we have a fairly broad market basket   GIS 
 We re not anticipating  taking price  in our consumer business at this point Obviously if  inflation  gets excessive then we ll readjust our thinking  But certainly we re not anticipating anything before the end of 2014    MKC 
If there is inflation there are some barriers to getting it to the consumer  Retailers are sacrificing margins to give consumers deals
 This decrease in the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributed to an increase in coupon expense resulting from an increase in redemptions and a slight increase in the average coupon amount   Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  
Lennar blames slow housing market on limited supply and tight credit
 Generally speaking  the market continues a slow and steady recovery that is driven by limited supply of available homes both new and existing that are on the market  limited supply of land available to add to the supply of these homes and constrained demand from purchasers who would like to buy  but are unable to access the mortgage market    Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  
Lennar argues that banks are still afraid of getting penalized for making aggressive loans
 to the extent that  banks  see put back risk is great and really political and social risk is also great it s hard for the lenders to get back in the business lending on a rational and reverted to normal kind of underwriting standard    LEN 
And says that we are far from 2006
 Every time I hear that we don t want to go back to excesses of 2006  the fact that they throw that caveat in there is reflective of the fact that they don t realize just how far field we are from that    LEN 
Still  Lennar argues that fundamentals are strong and that rising rents  more inflation   will push housing prices higher
 I ve said a number of times that I think it s really relevant that rental rates continue to run higher than fully loaded monthly payments on for sale product and rental rates have continued to move up  So  there seems to be kind of a push on pricing across kind of the platform  
Several companies had positive things to say about Europe
 We re definitely very pleased to see the rebound we had in EMEA  which is something we ve been watching very carefully this last quarter what I am particularly pleased with is when you look at the countries contributing to EMEA growth both from a consulting and outsourcing standpoint  we have quite largest markets in the country and countries in Europe and think about France  Italy  Germany the U K    Accenture plc  NYSE ACN  
 if you look at Europe in particular  the booking patterns have improved  So  people are booking further ahead than they did the prior year  Occupancy is up  yields are up  so that s all very positive stuff    Carnival  NYSE CCL  
 Our EMEA business exceeded our expectations  It s very good news to see this business beginning to show some top line growth after our prolonged recession in the region   Steelcase Inc  NYSE SCS  
Chinese quick service restaurants are recovering
 In China what we are seeing is a recovery in QSR  driven I think a lot by our customers having an increased frequency promotions and limited time offers to bring consumers back to the stores    MKC 
Brazil is rebounding too
 We were watching carefully what was happening in Brazil  We had excellent performance for many years and we had a kind of pause almost a year ago literally So again it s very encouraging to see that through all the efforts made by our Brazilian leadership  Brazil is back with high single digit growth this quarter   Accenture plc  NYSE ACN  
Financials
Two examples of good old fashioned financial engineering 
Monsanto taking advantage of favorable debt markets to fund a share buyback
 Given the strength of our current balance sheet and our confidence in our growth prospects  we have decided to take advantage of the favorable debt market  By the end of FY  15  we intend to target the net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 5  And one of the ways we will immediately put that structure to work is through a new 10 billion share buyback authorization   Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  
Walgreen mulling tax inversion  but it s not necessarily a no brainer
 We re looking at everything from what the timing  best timing would be  what the capital structure should be  what our tax structure or what the structure could do to as far as our effective tax rate  So  and that s complex stuff I guess is what I would say Ricky as we work through this  We are working around the clock to try to understand all the above so that we re able to make the right decision for the company    WAG 
Consumer
The Millenial homebuyer hasn t defined themselves yet
 today s millennial generation has not yet quite defined itself  Is it going to be focused on something that s more in the middle the city focused or are they going to be building their family by getting married and having children maybe a little bit later in life  but nonetheless still looking for suburban lifestyle    Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  
Land should be  20  of the cost of a home
 If you look at our land cost as a percentage of ASP it stayed relatively constant in that 20  to 21  of sales price which allows to have a really strong margin    LEN 
Companies are starting to crack the code on digital marketing 
It s about creating a dialogue
 An ongoing two way dialogue with consumers is also a critical element of our digital ecosystem  Through our social media platforms  we leverage the power and passion of sport to deepen our relationship with our consumers  
Because digital marketing is about creating a dialogue  we may start to see  public relations  take share from  advertising  
McCormick calling out  Digital and PR  as an advertising category
 Where we are spending our money is about half in TV half in digital and PR and so we are encouraged by what we are seeing     MKC 
Consumer definitions of health are changing more focus on protein
 The consumer definition of health is changing in the cereal category  Clearly  they are interested in protein  clearly there are things that they   some consumers want to avoid like gluten  and so you re going to see us build on those trends with new product offerings and continued renovation    GIS 
People are snacking more
 Clearly snacking is a trend  a positive trend  and so maybe that is a key factor of that and we re very focused on the snacking trend  and it s not just the snacks in our snack businesses  we see yogurt becoming more and more of a snack food   GIS 
 Our snack customers are continuing to do pretty well and continuing to innovate and we re seeing that reflected    MKC 
Packaged foods struggling to maintain wallet share
 Our packaged food customers are struggling with core volume and part of the way that they are trying to overcome that is with new product innovation that we are working with them on   MKC 
Branded food companies are seeing more startup competition
 What we are seeing is very small inroads from a number of small and regional competitors that are gaining one tenth of a share point or two tenths of a share point  Their overall share base is still less than 1  or 2    MCK 
 Our view is just the sheer number of new items and number of new competitors certainly in a   for instance in yogurt space  just lots of people coming in with new items  And so the competition for a limited number of quality display options  I would say is increasing    GIS 
Technology
Among other things  Accenture s customers are focused on creating industry specific applications
 our clients are focused on four main themes  the digital customer  efficiency in cost optimization  industry specific solutions and advancing the technology agenda  including new technologies  extending ERP and network optimization  
Athletes want more real time feedback on performance
 Athletes are demanding more real time personalized feedback on their performance  They want easy access to products and services that will help them improve  And they want to be part of a community where they can share and compare information   NKE 
Nike an early adopter that sees revolutionary potential in 3D printing
 In New York at the Super Bowl  we launched the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat  our first cleat to take advantage of the revolutionary potential of 3D printing    NKE 
Healthcare
Still early days for the Affordable Care Act
 it s still very early to tail around ACA  I mean obviously publicly they have announced 8 million people have joined the ACA  We certainly feel like we re getting our share of that 8 million people  but certainly some of those folks were former cash paying customers that are now in the exchange    WAG 
Materials  Industrials  Energy
Accenture s resources segment sees moderate improvement
 we saw moderate improvement in resources with 2  growth  Energy continues to generate strong growth globally  but we did see some moderation from previous quarters  particularly in North America    ACN 
Corn had an ok year from a planting standpoint
 I think corn had a good year not a great year if you look across the Americas we saw acreage contract and I think a big piece of our numbers reflects that contraction    MON 
Lots of corn acres shifted to soybeans  which are having a record year at Monsanto
 our soybean business is having an absolutely record year driven by course of new products in soybeans and the build out of Roundup Ready to Yield  but also the portfolio advantage we have is those corn acres shifted to bean acres and we picked up on that    MON 
Agricultural productivity will be increasingly important over the next 20 years
 f you look forward than the next 20 years  there are no new acres  With one or two exceptions  there are no new acres and then sustainable intensification yield becomes more and more important  And the way you unlock that on a sustainable basis is providing better advice to the grower that allows him or her to get more bushels on that same footprint    MON 
Miscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom
Consumer products companies are marketing companies
 We are marketing company so our job is to understand the change and capitalize on it   GIS 
Marketing is about understanding what your customer wants and giving it to her
  Having  a better understanding of what exactly the consumer wants there  we will get better at giving them  giving those products to her    GIS 
You have to earn your relationship with your customer every day
 The key to unlocking this potential is and always has been to focus on the consumer  Our relationship with the consumer is something we need to earn every day    NKE 
At its core  cost cutting is about raising labor productivity and reducing wasted materials
 There is a whole range of supply chain and manufacturing initiatives in place all the way from the evolutionary to the revolutionary  And the objective there is to raise the productivity of labor to reduce waste of materials and produce even more premium product    NKE 
New business units should need to prove success to earn additional investment dollars
 We ve again taken the philosophy that we we pay as we go  So as the business earns its ability to invest then we ll make the investment   MKC 
There s always room to take price when you have a strong brand
 We think we can continue to raise prices  particularly around product innovation and brand strength    NKE

 After a tough ride in 2014  the consumer staple sector had a good start to 2015 on the back of moderate economic recovery  better job prospects  improved business and renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery  Rising wages and cheaper fuel were the other positives  With oil and natural gas prices subsiding  consumers are left with more disposable income  Commodity costs have in many cases stabilized  Consumers are also expecting lower inflation primarily due to lower gas prices  A decline in commodity prices may improve profit margins for certain staples companies  However  the continued appreciation of the U S  dollar relative to most foreign currencies will be a near term headwind to the earnings of U S   based staples companies with significant international operations  Other risks include potential price wars  a competitive environment  slowdown in international markets  including continued slowdown in China   political turmoil in Russia  sluggishness in Japan and an unfavorable economic environment in Europe  If we analyze the trend on a year to date basis  consumer staple stocks performed well at the beginning of the year compared with the S P 500 as a whole  However  the current situation is just the opposite  as the S P 500 index is well above the consumer staple stocks index  Industry players like McCormick   Co  Inc   NYSE MKC   Analyst Report   Energizer Holding  Inc   NYSE ENR   Analyst Report   General Mills  Inc   NYSE GIS   Analyst Report   Molson Coors Brewing Co   NYSE TAP   Analyst Report   Tyson Foods  Inc   NYSE TSN   Analyst Report  have posted positive earnings surprises of 9 4   14 5   4 5   7  and 2 7   respectively  in their recently reported quarters  On the contrary  Monster Beverage Corporation  NASDAQ MNST   Analyst Report  and Sysco Corp  NYSE SYY   Analyst Report  fell short of their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  mainly due to currency headwinds  Hopefully  the second half of the year will prove to be better for these companies with a strong rebound in earnings Earnings Trends Nearly all the consumer staple companies have reported their first quarter results  wherein the earnings  beat ratio  was 60 6  while the revenue  beat ratio  was only 42 4   On a year over year basis  total earnings for this sector are expected to decline 6 3  in the second quarter compared with 1 3  growth registered in the first quarter of 2015  Total revenue is expected to decline 12 4  in the second quarter against a decline of 3 9  in the previous quarter  Annual 2015 earnings are expected to decline 2 6   while 2016 earnings are expected to increase 8 5   Revenues are expected to decline 10 1  in 2015  while it is expected to increase 2 8  in 2016  The sector is expected to contribute 6 5  of the total S P 500 income for 2014  less than its 7 2  market cap weight in the index at present  This signals that the companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment Bottom Line The first quarter 2015 earnings turned out to be a mixed bag for consumer staples stocks  On the one hand  it was characterized by a gradual recovery in economic scenario and lower fuel prices  which helped the companies to recover from the sluggishness  on the other hand  the companies faced significant foreign currency headwinds  The current trend shows that the companies would take time to overcome the difficult consumer spending environment at least til 2015 ",2015-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/consumer-staples-stock-outlook---june-2015-254662,254662
