Prepared Remarks 
OperatorThank you for holding and welcome to Rockwell Automation s Quarterly Conference Call  I need to remind everyone that today s conference call is being recorded  Later in the call  we will open up the lines for questions   Operator Instructions  At this time  I would like to turn the call over to Jessica Kourakos  Head of Investor Relations  Ms  Kourakos  please go aheadJessica Kourakos    Head of Investor RelationsGood morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation s First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call  With me today is Blake Moret  our Chairman and CEO  and Patrick Goris  our CFO  Our results were released earlier this morning  and the press release and charts have been posted to our website  Both the press release and charts include  and our call today will reference  non GAAP measures  Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non GAAP measures  A webcast of this call will be available at that website  for replay  for the next 30 days  For your convenience  a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today s call Before we get started  I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore  forward looking statements  Our actual results may differ materially from our projections  due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings So  with that I ll hand the call over to Blake Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks Jessica  and good morning everyone  Thank you for joining us on the call today  Please turn to page 3 of the slide deck  I ll begin by saying that I m pleased with our execution in the quarter and our start to the year  Despite a tough manufacturing environment  both revenue and earnings were slightly better than our expectations for Q1  Total sales grew 3   including over four points of contribution from inorganic investments  primarily related to our Sensia joint venture Organic sales were down 1  compared to a strong quarter a year ago  Backlog however  was up year over year as well as sequentially  Organic sales performance continues to include market share gains in core platforms  For instance  Independent Cart Motion Control Technology grew strong double digits for us in the quarter  It is becoming a game changing solution across a broad range of industries and applications  Information Solutions and Connected Services  or IS CS for short  had another great quarter  also growing strong double digits We had notable wins in Life Sciences  Food   Beverage  our first MES win in Luxury Goods  a significant MES win in mining  and our first ever augmented reality project in Oil   Gas  Our broader and more differentiated portfolio gives us more ways to win in a wide variety of industries  including those  where we are not the incumbent control platform Recurring revenue in the quarter grew double digits  led by an increase in software subscriptions  As I mentioned  our earnings performance was slightly better than expected  Segment margins and adjusted EPS include one time items related to Sensia  as well as investments we are making to increase our long term differentiation As we look ahead to the rest of the year  we are reaffirming our organic sales and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2020  While there have been recent positive developments on global trade  and the macro environment is showing signs of stabilization  it is still too early to see that impact on customer spending Let s now turn to slide 4 and go a little deeper into our vertical sales performance for the quarter  Discrete and Hybrid end market segments did a little better than we expected this quarter  while Process was a little weaker than we expected  Within our Discrete segment  Auto grew mid single digits  largely related to higher program spend in North America and Asia Pacific  and stabilization in MRO  albeit at low levels  While this higher program spend was better than anticipated  the overall auto market is still relatively weak and we think it is premature to change our flat full year outlook for this vertical Semiconductor sales were notably better in all regions  up high single digits  Historically  our exposure to semis has been largely in facilities management  but we are also seeing new traction in material handling  IoT and cybersecurity applications Turning now to our Hybrid market segment  Food   Beverage declined low single digits  reflecting some project delays  However  given what we are hearing from customers  and the activity we have seen at packaging OEMs  we still believe Food   Beverage will grow low single digits for the year  In Life Sciences  we had another solid quarter  with sales growing both year over year as well as sequentially  As we said before  this is an industry where our scalable architecture and our differentiation in IS CS are well aligned and paying dividends Our Process market segment declined slightly  especially in Chemicals and Pulp   Paper  Organically  oil   gas grew mid single digits this quarter and we continue to expect low single digit sales performance for the year  Sensia  which had a good start to the year  is expected to grow double digits based on its differentiation in the fast growing  digital oilfield segment of this vertical Turning to slide 5 and our regional sales performance in the quarter  North America was down 3  organically  reflecting weak manufacturing environment  The weakness in process industries was partially offset by Auto  up double digits  and strength in Semiconductor  EMEA was up 2  in the quarter  led by Oil   Gas  Life Sciences  and Tire  Asia Pacific grew by 6   led by strong demand for Oil   Gas  Life Sciences  and Auto Auto was up over 10  in the region  and included strong gains at EV battery manufacturers  where our readiness to serve is high  Our portfolio is demonstrating how well positioned we are  to benefit from the transition to EV  Latin America sales were down 1   largely due to a tough comparison from last year and weaker performance in Automotive and Mining I ll now make a few additional comments on our other accomplishments in the quarter  Our Annual Automation Fair was held last November in Chicago  and I m proud to say that we reached a new all time attendance record  Customers are focusing on outcomes  and sharply increased sales leads from the event  indicate we are demonstrating our increased value for a wide variety of industries  We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November  There  we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long term growth  while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner more flexible cost structure  We also had exciting new partners at the event  including Schlumberger  Accenture  and Ansys  which is a game changing technology partner for simulation and digital twin applications We are seeing our partnerships contribute to many strategic wins and we had some great wins this quarter  including in Life Sciences across all major geographies  In Europe  we signed a major agreement with Roche  Roche will be implementing our PharmaSuite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions  In North America  we entered into a new multi site  multi year agreement with a major pharmaceutical producer  They selected FactoryTalk Innovation Suite to drive their Digital Transformation program for a connected plant and supply chain It will provide a common platform to drive real time visibility of analytics to the operator  plant and enterprise levels  predict future events to avoid unplanned downtime and improve energy efficiency  and accelerate knowledge transfer and improve ease of use  Once implemented  this solution will eliminate hundreds of overlapping edge solutions  resulting in significant operational savings In China  Ruiying Pharma Group  a large pharmaceutical company  chose Rockwell to transform their factories to become smarter and more predictive  while at the same time assisting them to oversee quality management and ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements From regulatory compliance  to safety and energy efficiency  Rockwell is becoming an increasingly important partner of our customers  ESG initiatives  In addition to what we are doing in our own facilities  everything we do for customers is about increasing efficiency  reducing energy usage  improving worker safety  and ensuring regulatory compliance  all of which lowers business risk and is good for the environment Now  turning to slide 6  let s talk a little more about our inorganic investments  which are becoming an increasingly important complement to our long term organic growth strategy  Starting with Sensia  this was our first quarter including Sensia as a fully operational joint venture consolidated in our results  and I am very pleased with its performance in Q1  Operationally  Sensia s top line grew double digits with strong traction at marquee Oil   Gas customers around the world  Our sales teams have been fully integrated  and we are looking forward to the launch of new solutions and products that will contribute to the double digit sales performance we expect this year We also announced the acquisition of MESTECH at the beginning of Q1  MESTECH is an industrial software consulting and delivery services company based in India  and they have already been instrumental in winning key business for us in the quarter  Earlier this month  we announced the acquisition of Avnet Data Security  a cybersecurity provider based in Israel with over 20 years of experience  Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing parts of our services business  The extensive knowledge and experience of the Avnet team will support our company s strategic objective to achieve double digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services  by expanding our IT OT cyber and network expertise globally  Plus  this acquisition will establish a global cybersecurity Center of Excellence for us in EMEA  This includes a remote managed service center and expands our portfolio of capabilities  including a full training curriculum and labs As you can see  we are actively deploying capital to advance our strategic priorities to accelerate share gains in our core business  continue growing double digits in IS CS  grow domain expertise in process  and accelerate our market access in Europe and Asia  We are focused on driving value with more intensity than ever before Let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks  Patrick Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Blake  and good morning everyone  I ll start on slide 7  first quarter key financial information  First quarter reported sales were up 2 6  year over year  As expected  organic sales were down 1   Acquisitions  which mainly represent the impact of Sensia  contributed 4 5 points of growth  better than expected  Currency translation decreased sales by 0 9 points  a higher headwind than we expected Segment operating margin was 20 1   down 270 basis points compared to last year  About half of the year over year decrease relates to the impact of acquisitions and related one time costs  primarily Sensia  The other half of the year over year margin decrease is about evenly split  between higher investment spending and unfavorable mix General Corporate net expense of  32 8 million was up  11 million compared to last year  The increase is due to the impact of mark to market adjustments related to our deferred and non qualified compensation plans and Sensia related transaction fees  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 7 9  compared to 18 7  last year  About half of the reduction in the year over year tax rate is due to a Sensia  19 million one time tax benefit  The remainder is due to other discrete items  primarily tax benefits from option exercises Adjusted EPS of  2 11 was a bit better than we expected  and down  0 10 compared to the first quarter of last year  a decrease of 5   The year over year decrease in adjusted EPS  is primarily due to lower organic sales  particularly in some of our product businesses leading to unfavorable mix  and higher investment spending  Partially offsetting that is a lower tax rate excluding the Sensia impacts  and the net benefit of a lower share count and higher net interest expense  The net year over year adjusted EPS contribution of Sensia in the quarter was  0 01  The Sensia contribution of  0 01 includes a  0 07 larger than expected headwind related to one time items  Free cash flow was  194 million in the quarter  or about 80  of adjusted income  During the quarter  we paid the annual bonus that our employees earned in fiscal 2019 A few additional items not shown on the slide  for adjusted EPS  average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 116 6 million  down 4 9 million or about 4  from last year  We repurchased about 0 5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of  100 million  This is in line with our full year target of about  400 million  At December 31st  we had  1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorizationSlide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments  The Architecture   Software segment had modest organic growth in the quarter  Segment margin was very strong at 29 8  and a bit lower than the record margin last year  mainly due to increased investment spending  Organic sales of the Control Products   Solutions segment decreased 2 5   Inorganic investments increased sales by 8 2  compared to last year  Sensia accounts for almost all of the inorganic growth  Organic sales for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was down about half a point year over year  The higher margin product businesses in this segment were down about 5  on an organic basis First quarter organic book to bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was 1 12  typical for a first quarter  Operating margin for this segment of 12 4  was down 310 basis points compared to Q1 last year  primarily due to Sensia one time items  lower organic sales  and unfavorable mix  Segment margin excluding the year over year impact of Sensia was about 14  In the appendix  you will find two slides with a more detailed overview of the year over year incremental impact of Sensia for Q1 and for full year fiscal 2020 outlook  It is the same format we provided to you at our investor day  As I mentioned earlier  from an operational viewpoint  Sensia sales and earnings were a bit better than we expected  Non recurring items  including the tax benefit  were  0 07 worse than we expected in the first quarter  primarily due to larger purchase accounting adjustments and a lower tax benefit  For full year fiscal 2020  we now expect the net year over year impact of Sensia to be about neutral to adjusted EPS  The financial framework we shared with you at investor day last November remains valid with Sensia  We continue to target 30 to 35  earnings conversion for Rockwell assuming mid single digit organic sales growth This takes us to slide 9  guidance  Our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged compared to our November guidance  We are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges  For adjusted EPS  in essence  compared to prior guidance  small headwinds due to Sensia one time items  currency  and a higher share count are offset by a somewhat lower adjusted effective tax rate  The lower tax rate is the result of a higher excess income tax benefit related to share based compensation General corporate net is now expected to be closer to  105 million  Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about  40 million  up  20 million compared to last year  Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about  100 million  We expect non controlling Interest to be about  10 million  or a  0 10 charge to adjusted EPS Average diluted share count is now expected to be 116 5 million for fiscal 2020  and our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 15 5   which includes about a 150 basis point one time benefit related to Sensia  We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100  of adjusted income Finally  we continue to project a weaker first half of the year  with organic sales down low single digits  followed by a stronger second half of the year  And as is typical for us  we expect weaker 2nd quarter Adjusted EPS performance versus the first quarter With that  I ll hand it to Jessica to start Q A Jessica Kourakos    Head of Investor RelationsThanks Patrick  Before we start the Q A  I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you in as possible  So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow up  Thank you  Sharon  let s take our first question Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays Unidentified ParticipantHey  good morning everyone  This is Xiao  Phonetic  on for Julian Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Unidentified ParticipantMaybe can we start with diving into backlog trends  Can you maybe just provide some color on what drove the sequential rise and the year over year rise  And then  maybe within that  anymore details on Solutions and Services Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerSure  how much more color we can provided except that as we mentioned  backlogs are up both year over year and sequentially  and I would say it was broad based  including in North America Unidentified ParticipantGot it  Thank you  And then  at the end market level  kind of on the mid single digit growth for oil and gas  was this on kind of company specific drivers  maybe share gains  or are you seeing kind of more positives in the end market as a whole Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerOn the organic side  there obviously has been a flattish capital spending and we do see a slowing of the oil and gas organically  However  on the Sensia joint venture  because the majority of that is focused on producing wells and not drilling new wells  we see it less susceptible to capex reductions and that gives us confidence based on our first quarter results and the outlook that double digits impact part of our overall oil and gas business  can take share and grow fast Unidentified ParticipantPerfect  Thank you Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorNext question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystHi  good morning  It s Karen Lau dialing in for John Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Karen Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGood morning  So  thank you for the details on Sensia in the appendix  I was just wondering in terms of the core margins  it looks like  you guys were making 18  core margins excluding the one time items in the first quarter  but then in the full year you are guiding to around 14  margins  What is the driver of that Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  the way you can think about it  Karen  what you see in the appendix is the year over year incremental piece of Sensia  It s the impact of the contribution of Schlumberger  which was higher margin business than what we contributed Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystOkay Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAnd so  therefore  when we talk about overall margin profile of Sensia  we do expect it to be a 20  EBITDA business going forward  But this year  we think it will be closer to mid teens Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystOkay  But is it    I mean  am I reading correctly that the first quarter results were better than what you were expecting for the full year  Or is that like some   Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerBut the piece that was contributed by Schlumberger and the synergy  the answer to that is  yes  I would also say that our spend increased in Sensia  because we are making some investments in technology and commercial resources  They were a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we expected  That s why you see that margin in Q1 being a little bit better as well  than what you see for the full year outlook Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGot it  And then  just quickly  can you remind us what s your expectation for investment spending for the year and kind of the cadence throughout the year Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  the way you can think about it  Karen is  consistent with what I mentioned to you in November  We think the year over year increase will be a little bit less than a 2   and it will be first half weighted  And so  we expect it to be more than that in the first half and in the second half  the increase year over year will be minimal  in terms of year over year spend Karen Lau    Gordon Haskett    AnalystGot it  Thank you Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Karen OperatorNext question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystHi  it s Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerHey Rob Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystHow are you doing  So  in any event  just wondered    first  I mean  obviously wasn t    it s very dynamic situation right now  You ve had the trade deal  You ve had very encouraging quarter  but obviously you ve had this rising potentials of pandemic  and I don t want to get too much of a Debbie Downer  but how do you think about kind of your supply chain in China  how do you think about  kind of the trends in spillover  I know it s very early and you don t have a lot of information yet  but could you just give us some factors to think about and what sensitivities you are looking at  in terms of exposures as you manage this situation Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerSure  Well  first of all  Rob  the overwhelming first priority for us is to ensure that we are looking after our people in the region  And so  we are paying close attention to that  to make sure that we can reduce to the very extent possible their exposure Second  and on a parallel path  we are undergoing a detailed review of our own manufacturing footprint  as well as our supply base to gauge the potential impacts  At this point  we don t expect an impact to the quarter s performance  but as you said  it s a very dynamic situation and we are monitoring it hourly and looking for new inputs to help inform how we feel about the business impacts  But it s the safety and well being of our employees first Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystThank you for that  And then  I guess the follow up would be  maybe just a little more color around Information Solutions and Connected Services  the continued double digit growth there  Can you talk about  kind of the continued developments and collaboration with PTC  some of the wins and maybe expand your comments around augmented reality  And I don t know track and trace is something that s started to pick up there or is looking to be encouraging Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  Rob  it s a great story for us and with our own offerings that we ve developed ourselves  plus with partners like PTC  the Information Solutions and Connected Services part of our offering continues to grow strong double digits and we are seeing that it s a true differentiator in some of the fastest growing parts of the overall automation market like electric vehicles and Life Sciences  So  it works perfectly to complement the basic automation that we are providing in those industries whether it s discrete automotive assembly or it s process control for pharma  but as they are looking for more traceability  as they are looking for adding the ability to transfer knowledge from older workers to newer workers  augmented reality is a great part of that We have mentioned before  about a third of our sales of the software in this space include augmented reality  So it all works together  It s increasing the hit rate for our MES software  because we have a broader portfolio and it works together well  So  there is a lot of positives in this respect  And I should mention it s not just for end users  It s also for OEMs  because they are looking for increasing the value of what they are providing and as they look for ways to increase their flexibility getting closer to that zero changeover time for packaging that is hard in the industry today  Then this has a lot of benefit for them  as well  We had a win in the quarter with Harpak  who you heard from us at the Investor Day in November as they are adding that software to the basic logics control and variable speed drives and so on as part of the basic automation of those systems And then as a final point  we have seen  probably a higher degree of adoption of this software on top of competitive control platforms than we originally thought would happen Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystThanks for your time Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks Rob OperatorNext question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystYes  good morning  Thank you for the questions  Blake  could you kind of speak maybe to the geographic mix  the organic growth by geography in the quarter  And it just    it seems a bit scattered here  I mean  I presume  Asia was probably better than expected  U S  maybe a little bit weaker  But how does the incoming backlog being up quarter to quarter and year over year  how does that filter into maybe the geographic growth that you expect for the full year against    kind of that midpoint of flat expectation for all of Rock Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  let me start with a couple of comments and then Patrick may have got some additional color on that  But as I said  Asia was better than expected  Latin America was worse than expected  North America and EMEA were pretty much in line with expectations  In North America  as we mentioned  we were down by 3  and that was largely due to declines in more process oriented verticals with the exception of oil and gas  So  we saw chemical  pulp and paper and metals  and then that was offset by the growth we mentioned in automotive  power and semiconductor EMEA was up and oil and gas was a contributor there along with a recurrent theme of Life Sciences  Waste water was a good area for us in EMEA  And in Asia  we were up with growth in oil and gas  Life Sciences  Auto  Tire and mass transit  And then  LATAM was down a little bit where weakness in Auto and mining was partially offset by growth in power  oil and gas and Life Sciences  So that was kind of a rundown of what we saw in Q1  In terms of how the backlog feathers into that  obviously  mainly project  but also with some of the higher value services as well  particularly those included with the Connected Services part of IS CS Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerRick  maybe a little bit of color as to our assumptions by region for the full year  So  organic growth at the midpoint is flat year over year  We expect both the    both North America and EMEA to be a little bit below that and we expect both Latin America and Asia to be up a little less than 5   about mid single digits Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystOkay  And   Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerSo  what    but that inflected as we expect in essence better than our guidance  we expect second half of the year as I mentioned improvement and that includes the U S   I would say  North America Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystOkay  And was there any noticeable impacts on the backlog and order flow around passage of the U S  MCA when you are talking about Latin America and Mexico  Was there any noteworthy improvement in bookings or anything once that uncertainty was more or less lifted Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerNot yet  is the short answer  I mean  it s a positive step and supporting the concept of free and fair trade that we ve talked a lot about in the past  So we think it s a good thing  But we haven t seen the results on outperformance yet Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystOkay  Very good  Thank you Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorNext question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer     AnalystThank you  I was intrigued  Blake  because you call out ESG as a potential driving force for your customers to implement your suite of offerings  Conceptually  I think we can understand that  there is a basic efficiency play here that plays in ESG  Could you maybe provide some examples of where you are seeing that make a material difference in customers  decisions Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWell  as you said  everything we do is about productivity and a huge part of that productivity is efficiency  So  you take our power control offering  variable speed drives  which reduce dramatically the amount of energy that s required to run industrial processes  tremendous amount of the world s energy is consumed in factories and simply  not running full across the line when you don t need it saves a ton of energy and our variable speed drives  low voltage and medium voltage continue to be a very strong part of our offering  Specifically  in the new eco industrial segment that we introduced in November  talking about our support of renewable of water and waste water treatment and mass transit  those are all industries that reduce the amount of energy that are required and it was no coincidence that we created that new segment  because we are going to be doing more in that space And then finally  safety  that s something we ve talked a lot about in the past and in terms of the technology to be able to automate safety  but also the services that we provided  that s an important part of ESG  We think that we are number one in the world when you pull all the discrete and process safety technology together  and that remains a really important area for us Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer     AnalystThat s helpful  And then  maybe drilling into auto a little bit  as you said it surprised the upside  and you gave some good color around some regional patterns there in your prepared remarks  But just  the outlook for kind of  soft overall light vehicle demand  is that having any impact as far as you can tell on kind of the backlog the longer cycle business  in terms of OEM plans to bring new models to market or planned model changeovers  How are you thinking about that Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerWell  we are guiding to about flat currently with the overall automotive segment for the year  I d say the growth is highest in the specific EV drivetrain portion of the segment  as people are bringing that capacity online  whether it s the brand owner or it s the tier supplier  and by the way that contributed a lot to our performance  That was a little better than expectations and if you want it was battery assembly that was a specific bright spot for there  That s offset to some extent by the reality of a weaker star count for fewer vehicles than we saw a couple years ago being bought  Certainly  a lot of the brand owners are reducing their sedan portfolio  But there is still a fair bit of project spend there and in the    particularly in the SUV side of things  And the growth that we saw in the quarter was primarily due to project spend  MRO stabilized  but we didn t see any real growth in MRO in the quarter Noah Kaye    Oppenheimer     AnalystThat s helpful color  Thanks Blake Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thanks  Noah OperatorNext question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystHey guys  Good morning Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Steve Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystCan you just talk about a little bit more about what you re seeing on the food and beverage side and OEM  And then on maybe just a bit of color on how you see  kind of quarterly organic progressing maybe move through the rest of the year Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerSure  I ll start with the food and beverage  We did see some delays in food  But one of the bright spots and I mentioned it is  we actually saw mid single digit growth in packaging OEMs and it s early but that s sometimes a leading indicator as people are putting packaging in place and we did see that across the regions We also heard anecdotally from the packaging OEMs that their backlog is fairly good and so those are encouraging signs  One area of particular strength for us    it s small but it is still noteworthy India packaging OEMs and I say it s is noteworthy because India maybe the most competitive market in the world and for us to have a success there is a really younger testament to the functionality and the ability to get to competitive levels there  I was actually there in visit with some customers including some packaging OEMs in December  And I think there is some great opportunities there and we are going to continue to look at what we can do to grow our presence even faster in the Indian market  But in general  packaging OEMs were up  We also saw some strength  specifically in beverage  We had a real nice conversion at a beverage OEM that s going to a well known beverage user and so that was also good in the quarter Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystAnd then you said  quarterly  yes  progression on organic Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  see  for the full year  we remain at 0  organic growth  Obviously  Q1  we did minus 1  I would say  Q2  low  low single digits  meaning it s close to what we did in Q1  We don t expect it to get worse than what we did in Q1 and then for the balance of the year  I d say  Q4 organic growth a little bit better than Q3 Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  So  it seems to me that like  how do you get to kind of the low end of the range than if that s the case  I mean   Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerWhat I was providing was at the midpoint  Steve Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystYes  Okay  got it Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThe trend that I think we have seen in the past with chemical and we did see that is the single largest contributor in the quarter  That was primarily in North America  we actually saw an increase in chemical in EMEA  down in Asia  and slightly down in Latin America  So  is it s offset  As we mentioned  we actually saw a growth in oil and gas  but the chemical was down in the quarter and most of that was concentrated in North America Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerAs we said in the earlier  within Process  oil and gas was up  But generally  process industries were weak in the quarter Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerI would also mention  just for background that  in chemical lot of our exposure in specialty chemical  It s not as much in the bulk chemical  That s our traditional focus  There is some overcapacity that we are currently seeing in chemical and some effects from some of the consolidation that s been going on in the industry over the last couple of years as well  So that s some additional color that would certainly apply to North America Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystThat s great  Very helpful  And then just a quick one just on EV  I know  you said you had strong gains there during the quarter  I am just wondering if you can talk about China EV specifically and what you have been seeing there  Any changes Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  so  China    auto in China has been down Q3  Q4 of last year and we saw that continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2020  And that includes EVs  And so we are seeing some of the support or the subsidies go away in China and generally  and obviously it s still a little bit lumpy  because it s relatively small  But EV and auto in general  we are certainly seeing some weakness in China  Interestingly  auto in Asia was up for us quite a bit and the reason there we are making some progress with some of the EV companies outside of China including some companies in Korea for example Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  and that s specific application that Patrick is mentioning in Korea was the battery assembly  which is a great application for us  We have mentioned before that  in comparison to the subtractive manufacturing processes for internal combustion engines  now for boring cylinders and things like that that require a lot of CNC content  Battery assembly and motor winding and EV drivetrain  we have a high readiness to serve there and that s why we think that long term EV is a great market for us to be in Stephen Tusa    JP Morgan    AnalystThat s great  Thank you very much for your time Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  Thank you Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorNext question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Joshua Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good morning all Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Josh Joshua Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystSo  apologies if I missed it earlier on the call  But  Blake  one thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day that I want to see how that is playing out is  it s kind of the lower cyclicality of Rockwell maybe versus what folks would have been accustomed to five or ten years ago or even more that it does seem like at a point in time whether folks are seeing kind of a more depressed outlook that Rockwell is hanging in there a bit more stable  I guess  one  is that consistent with the way you guys are seeing the world  And two  is there kind of a coiled spring on the back end where you can see customers have a willingness to spend on projects  but there maybe not executing it  So  have we lost some of that upward mobility in exchange for lower cyclicality Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  I wouldn t draw that the causality between the two  But as we talked about a lot in November  that greater resiliency to economic cycles is something that we are making very explicit steps to address  And so  in addition to things like Information Solutions and Connected Services providing a lot of increased value to customers and pulling through some of our traditional products It does have an impact that we think is already being felt in terms of kind of clipping the trough of some of the normal volatility  Now it s still a relatively small part of our business  right  But that s compounding a strong double digit growth  plus what we do with acquisitions having more recurring revenue makes it more important each year and last year  We think    for instance  Information Solutions and Connected Services having about a point of organic growth to what we did and you know in a relatively low growth year overall  that s meaningful So  we are going to continue to work on that in terms of both our organic development  the products and the environment to be able to manage recurring revenue  But it s also a consideration as we look for companies to acquire and the percentage of recurring revenue Joshua Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  And then  just a follow up on investment  Again  apologies if you covered already  It seems like some of that got pulled forward into the first quarter as maybe demand was a little bit better than expected  How should we think about the sensitivity from here on kind of that full year investment budget  Is it at a healthy level to where if you are at the top end of the revenue range that the overall bucket doesn t increase  Or how are you thinking about the sensitivity over the remaining three quarters  Thanks Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  Josh  So  what we mentioned was that the spending in the    the year over year increase in the first half will be higher than in the second half  Actually  the second half the way we have it dialed in now is the flattish from a year over year spend point of view  However  if  depending on what happens with our outlook for the year  and if we end up doing better what we do at the midpoint  Clearly  we could decide to release more investments  There is a very long list of attractive investments that we are looking through all the time and we could decide to do more Joshua Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Thanks for the color Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorNext question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  good morning  Appreciate the question  I know you covered a lot of ground already  But and I know we tend to focus more on the end market out  So I am just wondering about the geographies and thinking about how geographically  things are playing out relative to your initial kind of guidance in November  In particular  North America  down 3 3  this quarter and I know that North America has been trending weak for some time now  But with ISM where it is and IP negative  how does that look in North America specifically compared to your initial kind of outlook  And kind of what s bouncing against that if it is weaker than you expected Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  so  as you said  the macro can generally be characterized as weak and there was some downward revisions  And our position to that is some of the backlog that was built in the first quarter and some of the things  Again like the IS and CS  the Information Solutions and Connected Services backdrop aren t going to be as coupled directly to some of the broader indicators  if in those areas  we can demonstrate a relatively quick return on that investment  which is often from OpEx then we think that that s going to be more resilient than some of the other more capital related spending Patrick Goris    Senior Vice President   Chief Financial OfficerYes  and then  Nigel  for Q1  we would say that North America and EMEA came in basically in line with our expectations  Asia Pacific came in better and Latin America came in weaker  And for the full year  compare estimate point  we think that North America and EMEA will be down a bit and we think that Asia Pacific and Latin America will be up mid single digits at a less than 5  Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Thanks  Patrick  And then a quick one on obviously A S is holding up a lot better through the soft patch than we ve seen historically  And I know it s also flowing through the IS layer  but can you just maybe    is there any way to quantify kind of the relationship with PTC and how that s helping to    maybe improve the trough performance of A S  And any color there would be helpful Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  I made a general comment to that and that is  manufacturing advanced manufacturing is becoming a much more noteworthy part of a company s overall digital transformation plans  So we see companies like Stanley Black   Decker  as they talk about fairly significant reductions in cost they re being asked to go a little deeper and explain how they are going to get there and we are finding ourselves apart of those explanations as to how we are going to be able to reduce OpEx for these companies  By having the relationship with PTC and having that increasingly important in IS CS offering  we are going to have those broad discussions at a higher level than if we were just talking about programmable controller performance or some of the other elements of basic automation So it allows us to get higher in the organization and deploy a meaningful part of those overall discussions whereas if we didn t have that kind of breadth  then we might find ourselves playing a little more deep ends in some of the core components  So that s at a high level how a partnership with a company like PTC will pull through some performance in the core products  because they all go together  that basic automation and then the information that sits on top of it to draw insights from the data that s born in our products Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Blake Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Nigel Jessica Kourakos    Head of Investor RelationsSharon  we will take one more question OperatorWe have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup    AnalystHey  good morning guys Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Andy Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup    AnalystThanks for letting me in  Blake  you might have talked about this earlier  but on Sensia  you mentioned that operating performance was better than expected  Maybe you could just talk about    give a little more color on what that means  Obviously  there is a lot of moving pieces with Sensia in the guide that you gave last quarter for the year  I think you talked about  0 05 excluding interest  Could it be better than that in 2020 Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean  we are pushing the team  obviously to perform as if they are in an open field because we think they are  We think that what they are offering is somewhat unique in the market and our original hypothesis that there was a low level of basic automation in the oilfield  particularly the onshore oilfield is proving to be true So that things that we are talking about as we are selling the traditional offerings into that space of things like measurement  devices  as well as artificial lift and so on  the ability to commence and to weave that together is really meeting with a lot of interest and some of these are our existing customers  but customers that in the past have bought the products as needed from us But now they are saying that we can play a much more significant part in their overall strategy  And I had a chance to talk with some of these customers over the last year in Latin America and in Europe and we are excited and even more excited after the first quarter s results  because these companies are voting with their wallets  And again  it s a solutions based approach  It s the measurement devices  it s the artificial lifts  it s the software and then it s the delivery capability to bring this all together to reduce their cost to produce a barrel of oil Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup    AnalystAnd Blake  I just wanted I just wanted to follow up on your comment on Latin America  A  is the incremental weakness or the moderation that that you saw really focused on mining and or just tough comparisons  there has been a little bit of unrest down there  You just mentioned oil and gas pretty strong  So  just what have seen down there Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerYes  so  mechanically  we still have some tough comps against that big Codelco project in mining that we ve talked about over the last year or so  And that project is going very well by the way  In general  in Latin America  we saw modest growth in Mexico and Brazil  but it was offset by weakness in Argentina and Chile and of course a good component of that would be mining related  Mexico was up low single digits and Brazil was also up low single digits  So  I think you are right that some of it is comps  We expect mining to be about flat for the year in Latin America Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  Blake Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Andy OperatorAnd at this time  I will turn the call over to Ms  Kourakos Jessica Kourakos    Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Sharon  I ll turn it back to Blake for few final comments Blake Moret    Chairman   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jessica  As we have been discussing  I am happy to see our new offerings delivering significantly increased value  We ve never been better positioned with a more differentiated offering as the convergence of IT and OT creates tremendous new opportunities  And our employees and partners they continue to set us apart and we are really excited about the journey ahead Jessica Kourakos    Head of Investor RelationsOkay  That concludes today s call  Thank you for joining us

126967,348482,ROK,Earnings Preview  Rockwell Automation  ROK  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment and software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 64 billion  down 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 48  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rockwell Automation 
For Rockwell Automation  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Rockwell Automation will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Rockwell Automation would post earnings of  1 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 01  delivering a surprise of  4 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Rockwell Automation doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-rockwell-automation-rok-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200500668,200500668
126968,348483,ROK,Will Rockwell Automation  ROK  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK   This company  which is in the Zacks Industrial Automation and Robotics industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This industrial equipment and software maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 75  
For the most recent quarter  Rockwell Automation was expected to post earnings of  1 92 per share  but it reported  2 01 per share instead  representing a surprise of 4 69   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 29 per share  while it actually produced  2 40 per share  a surprise of 4 80  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Rockwell Automation  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Rockwell Automation currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 36   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 29  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-rockwell-automation-rok-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200501510,200501510

127027,348542,ROK,Analysts Estimate Rockwell Automation  ROK  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment and software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 68 billion  down 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rockwell Automation 
For Rockwell Automation  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 89  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Rockwell Automation will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Rockwell Automation would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 40  delivering a surprise of  4 80  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Rockwell Automation doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-rockwell-automation-rok-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200482349,200482349

127066,348581,ROK,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Rockwell Automation  ROK ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK   This company  which is in the Zacks Industrial Automation and Robotics industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This industrial equipment and software maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7 78  
For the last reported quarter  Rockwell Automation came out with earnings of  2 21 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 98 per share  representing a surprise of 11 62   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 03 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 11 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 94  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Rockwell Automation  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Rockwell Automation currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 41   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-rockwell-automation-rok-200404809,200404809
127067,348582,ROK,Rockwell Automation  ROK  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment and software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 72 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rockwell Automation 
For Rockwell Automation  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Rockwell Automation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Rockwell Automation would post earnings of  1 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 21  delivering a surprise of  11 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Rockwell Automation appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rockwell-automation-rok-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200408318,200408318

Caterpillar Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
    Strong Order Growth to Drive Revenues At the end of 2018  Caterpillar s order backlog was at  16 5 billion  an improvement of  700 million year over year aided by increase in Energy   Transportation and Construction Industries  This bodes well for performance in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  13 4 billion for the first quarter indicates growth of 4 5  from the prior year reported quarter  For the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment  which contributed approximately 90  of total revenues in 2018  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of 2019 is pegged at  12 8 billion  suggesting year over year improvement of 6   For the Resource Industries segment  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the first quarter of 2019 is pegged at  2 556 million  indicating year over year growth of 16   Continued strong demand for aftermarket parts on account of higher machine utilization levels will drive sales  Further  miners are resuming capital spending which will support revenues for the segment  In the Construction Industries segment  continuous improvement in residential and non residential construction in North America will drive revenues  However  the recent slowdown in in China is a concern given that China represents about 10  to 15  of the construction industry segment s sales  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Construction segment s sales is projected at  5 869 million for the to be reported quarter  suggesting a year over year rise of 4   For the Energy   Transportation segment  sales to the Oil and Gas sector are likely to have increased in the to be reported quarter  aided by stable oil prices  Sales for industrial applications are likely to have remained strong  primarily backed by improving global economic conditions and higher end user demand across most applications  Sales to the Transportation sector will benefit primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services  Power Generation sales are improving after a multi year downturn and the momentum is likely to have sustained in the to be reported quarter  The segment s sales are expected to grow 22  year over year to  5 229 million in the first quarter of 2019  Cost Reduction Efforts to Sustain Margins Material cost inflation will continue to affect Caterpillar s margins  The company is also witnessing higher freight rates owing to strained capacity in the trucking industry  less efficient freight loads  and expedited freight as it continues to ramp production to meet increased demand  Given these concerns  the company s share price has slumped 8 3  over the past year  compared with the  s decline of 10 8   Caterpillar has been undergoing significant restructuring and cost reduction initiatives which have been benefiting margins   The first quarter of 2019 is anticipated to be no exception to the trend  as strong order flow  price hikes along with savings from cost reduction will help counter the impact of higher costs  For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit for the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment is pegged at  2 214 million  up 8  from the

127080,348595,ROK,Another Round Of Slight Gains Amid Choppy Session,opinion,"The Fed provided a momentary diversion today from our heavy focus on the trade talks in Washington  but the major indices still finished slightly positive for the second session in a row 
	Remember back on January 30th when Fed Chair Jerome Powell told us that the Fed would be patient in deciding future rate increases  It s one of the big reasons why January s success has carried over into February  Well  today we got the minutes from that meeting  where we read that the Committee might stop reducing the Federal Reserve s asset holdings sometime this year 
	Furthermore  they are a bit concerned with slowing global growth  which is also a worry on Wall Street at the moment 
	The market will always pay attention to what the Fed has to say  but its heart is currently with the second week of trade discussions between the U S  and China  As a result  the major indices chopped around a bit when the minutes were released and even slipped into the red for a moment  but they eventually recovered in what turned out to be another quiet day with slight gains

127087,348602,ROK,Why Rockwell Automation  ROK  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  in Focus
Headquartered in Milwaukee  Rockwell Automation  ROK  is an Industrial Products stock that has seen a price change of  19 56  so far this year  The industrial equipment and software maker is paying out a dividend of  0 97 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 46  compared to the Industrial Automation and Robotics industry s yield of 0 25  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 02  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 88 is up 10 5  from last year  Rockwell Automation has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10 04   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Rockwell Automation s payout ratio is 45   which means it paid out 45  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
ROK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  9 03 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 11 34  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  ROK presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-rockwell-automation-rok-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200367409,200367409

127096,348611,ROK,Rockwell Automation  ROK  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment and software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 63 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 65  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rockwell Automation 
For Rockwell Automation  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Rockwell Automation will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Rockwell Automation would post earnings of  2 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 11  delivering a surprise of  3 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Rockwell Automation doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rockwell-automation-rok-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200376198,200376198

127261,348776,ROK,Tap Q3 Growth With Revenue Weighted ETFs,opinion,The overall Q3 earnings picture for the S P 500 looks weak with projected earnings growth of  after double digit growth in each of the first two quarters of the year  Additionally  earnings growth in the last quarter of the year is expected to be in high single digits  Expected Q3 revenue growth of 5  is also lower than growth of 5 5  in Q2 and 7 6  in Q1 as well as 6 2  projected growth for Q4  This indicates Q3 growth on track to be the lowest of this year While only half of the sectors are expected to post positive earnings growth this season  revenue growth are widespread with just auto sector set to post revenue decline  Against this backdrop  revenue weighted ETFs will likely take lead over earnings weighted strategies and could be the potential outperformer this earnings season Why Revenue Weighted ETFs   First  while a series of headwinds might weigh on the profitability of companies  the decline in dollar could offer some relief to the top line  As such  many companies could come up with unexpected growth in revenues in their quarterly reports  giving a boost to revenue weighted ETFs  Though the ICE U S  Dollar index  a measure of the dollar s strength against a basket of currencies  showed immense strength in September  it is down nearly  in the last three months  read    Second  revenue weighted funds have outperformed the earnings counterparts from both the short and long term periods  proving the credibility of the superior weighting methodology  This is because revenues are a better indicator of a company s financial health  The top line is harder to manipulate or alter on a quarter by quarter basis as opposed to earnings that can easily be fattened using accounting tricks thereby leading to inaccuracy As a result  tilting toward the revenue metric is a more sensible choice  For investors seeking to do this  there is a small lineup of U S  focused ETFs that accomplish this task  Below  we have highlighted the funds that could be great choices for investors seeking to make money from the weak earnings of this year while at the same time focus on one of the most important aspects of stock investing Oppenheimer Large Cap Fund   BE RWL  This fund provides exposure to the top revenue generating companies within the large cap segment of the broad U S  stock market  It consists of the same securities as of the S P 500 Index  Holding 507 stocks in its basket  the fund is slightly concentrated on the top firm Wal Mart   NYSE WMT   at 4 3  of total assets while other firms hold no more than 2 2  share  Consumer discretionary  healthcare  financials  consumer staples  industrials and information technology are the top six sectors making up for a double digit exposure each  The ETF has amassed  770 5 million in its asset base and charges 39 bps in annual fees  Volume is moderate trading in about 60 000 shares a day  The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a Medium risk outlook  see    Oppenheimer ESG Revenue ETF This fund provides access to the top 50  of securities in the S P 500 Index by ESG score  excluding those with a detrimental score for controversies  and is weighted by revenue instead of market capitalization  It is home to 232 stocks with each holding no more than 3 7  share  From a sector look  consumer discretionary  industrials  information technology  consumer staples and healthcare receives double digit exposure each  The ETF has been able to manage  23 6 million in AUM since inception on Oct 28 while trades in meager volume of around 500 shares  suggesting wide bid ask spread beyond the expense ratio of 0 40  iShares Russell 1000 Pure U S  Revenue ETF This is the newest ETF having amassed  2 6 million since its debut in early August  It offers exposure to American companies that generate 85  or more of their sales from the United States by tracking the Russell 1000 Pure Domestic Exposure Index  It holds a well diversified basket of 422 stocks as none accounts for more than 3 6  share  However  one fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward financials while consumer discretionary  utilities and healthcare round off the next spots with double digit exposure each  The product charges 15 bps in annual fees and trades in paltry volume of 2 000 shares a day on average  read    Oppenheimer Financials Sector Revenue ETF   BE RWW  This ETF offers investors targeted access to the same stocks as the S P 500 Financials Index but weighed each security by revenue instead of market capitalization  It holds 69 stocks in its basket with a large exposure to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  at 15 7  while other firms hold no more than 7 3  of assets  The product failed to garner

127293,348808,ROK,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  ABB  Illinois Tool Works  Parker Hannifin  Ingersoll Rand,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  August 09  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Industrial Machinery  including ABB Ltd   NYSE   NYSE ABB        Illinois Tool Works Inc   NYSE   NYSE ITW        Parker Hannifin Corp   NYSE   NYSE PH        Ingersoll Rand PLC  NYSE   NYSE IR       Industry  Industrial MachineryLink  The U S  market showed strength subsequent to the election of President Trump  primarily factoring in his promised pro growth policies  However  the momentum has stalled following uncertainties looming over policy enactment and implementation As far the Industrial Products companies are concerned  the Trump government s infrastructure improvement plan  if implemented  will boost demand  Also  the sector is seeing improving export demand for its products from foreign nations Since the beginning of the year  industrial products stocks have been strong performers  with the sector gaining roughly 9 4  Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below Industrial Machinery   Nation Wise DescriptionThe United States  The country s industrial production increased at an annual rate of 4 7  in the second quarter  driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 5 7  in the first half of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries  Also  the job market showed strength  with the recent data indicating 209 000 new job additions in July  In second quarter 2017  new job additions averaged 194 333 per month  Unemployment rate declined from 4 4  in June to 4 3  in July Citing improvement in economic activities  the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates in June and indicated further rate hikes ahead  This  in turn  will make capital investments more expensive and hence might weigh on businesses for industrial products makers      Per its Jul 2017 report  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  trimmed its growth projections for the U S  economy by 20 basis points  bps  to 2 1  for 2017 and 40 bps to 2 1  for 2018 primarily on account of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of governmental policies Japan  According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months  decreased 1 4  in first quarter 2017 while fell nearly 3 1  in April and 3 6  in May   In second quarter 2017  total machinery order will likely decline 0 9  while core orders are expected to fall 5 9   Orders from manufacturing clients will likely fall 1 1  while that from government clients might decline 13 6  The country s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels  unfavorable exchange rates  aging population and a huge public debt  Also  the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015 In addition  the country is facing weak economic conditions externally  However  efforts to improve wages and hence  demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country s favor in the quarters ahead The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 10 bps to 1 3  for 2017 while it remained stable at 0 6  for 2018 China  China s GDP grew 6 9  from the year earlier period in the second quarter  coming in better than expected  Improvements in infrastructure investment  retail sales and higher exports due to healthy global economy have worked in its favor  In March  the government announced its plan to spend  2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020  However  tiff with the U S  economy over trade relationships might dent its growth momentum The country s industrial production increased 7 6  year over year in June on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector  Industrial production in both May and April grew 6 5  For 2017  the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6 7  in 2017 and 6 4  in 2018 India  The country s industrial production decelerated to 1 7  in May 2017  having expanded 2 8  in the previous month  Production suffered from lower rise in manufacturing output and contractions in mining and quarrying outputs Expectations of a strong demand  improved policies and better monsoon conditions are the factors that will influence the country s growth  going forward  The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world  Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country  these strategies will improve the domestic job market as well as demand for industrial products  The recent interest rate cut by the central bank  driven by prevailing low inflation rate in the country  will allow accessibility to cheap loans According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 2  in 2017 and 7 7  in 2018 Brazil  Political uncertainties continue to loom large over Brazil s economy and are mainly responsible for the countries  below investment grade ratings  Private investments are low while inadequate infrastructure and still high unemployment rate are making the economy more lackluster Strong efforts are being made to revive the economy  In July this year  interest rate was trimmed 100 bps by the countries  Central Bank  this being its seventh consecutive rate cut since Oct 2016  Also  inflation has eased over the past few months  Per the data available  industrial production in the country was flat in Jun 2017 compared with the previous month while showed expansion of 1 2  in May and 1 3  in April The IMF expects the country s output to grow 0 3  in 2017  reflecting a 10 bps increase from the previous forecast  However  growth projection for 2018 has been cut 40 bps to 1 3  Eurozone  Per the available data  industrial production in the Eurozone improved 1 3  in May from the prior month and rose 4  year over year  In April  industrial production inched up 0 3  from the previous month  The unemployment rate was 9 1  in June versus 9 2  in the previous month The IMF predicts output growth in Euro Area to be 1 9  in 2017  up 20 bps from the previous forecasts and grow 1 7  in 2018

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which showed equities mixed heading into the June Options Expiration Week  with the IWM and SPY  NYSE SPY  looking strong but the QQQ weak as there was rotation out of the QQQ and into IWM 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue lower while crude oil also looks better to the downside  The US dollar index continues to be biased lower while US Treasuries pullback in the uptrend  The Shanghai Composite is back to its upward drift and Emerging Markets are biased to continue higher 
Volatility looks to remain at very low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts show strength in the IWM and consolidation in the SPY short term with the QQQ looking diseased  Longer term all trends remain higher with real strength returning to the IWM  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

5 Stocks with Impressive Sales Growth Worth Buying Right Now 

	Sales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is an important part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making  By observing this key metric over a period of time  one can clearly understand a company s growth trend 
	Sales growth is crucial to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and unimpressive financial results  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  But companies need to show accelerated growth to attract new investors 
	Also  in an improving economy  lack of sales growth most likely indicates that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is required to support profitability 
	Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy 
	Strong liquidity position and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Picking the Winners
	In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our main screening parameters 
	But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry   This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry   Better than industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

127348,348863,ROK,Rockwell Automation  Ethan Allen Interiors  Unilever  Syngenta AG And Shin Etsu Chemical Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 16  2017   Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK   NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Ethan Allen Interiors  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Unilever  LON ULVR   NYSE         Syngenta AG  SIX SYNN   NYSE        and Shin Etsu Chemical  OTCMKTS        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	As the world becomes increasingly reliant on automation and companies providing technology solutions in this area  investors are scrambling to find the winners in this key market segment  One that could definitely be worth a closer look right now is Rockwell Automation  NYSE        and especially if recent trends continue 

Why Rockwell  

	Rockwell is in the often underappreciated area of industrial automation  helping manufacturing and industrial companies to streamline their production processes  The Wisconsin based company is in a number of different industries in this business too  including automotive  consumer products  commodity production  and infrastructure  just to name a few 

	The company is also coming off a nice earnings report in the most recent quarter which includes a double digit percentage beat compared to analyst estimates  Revenues were also up 8  in year over year terms  while guidance was also impressive for the company too 

What s Next  

	Thanks to this guidance increase and the general positive outlook for automation companies right now  analysts have been raising their earnings estimates for ROK stock as of late  We haven t seen any analysts cut their estimates for the current year  though nine have increased their estimates in the past month  while we have seen a six to one ratio of increases to decreases for the current quarter too 

	The magnitude of the estimate revisions has also been impressive  as we have seen a six percent lift in the current year consensus estimate in the past two months  while we have seen a similar boost in the following year estimate too  Add in an incredible history of living up to expectations in earnings season including only one miss of expectations since mid 2014 and it is easy to see why ROK is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock right now 

  

	The retail apocalypse appears to be upon us and is dragging down a number of companies in the traditional consumer market  And while much of this trend has been focused on the apparel side of the retail world  the furniture side has also been decimated too 

	In fact  the home furnishings industry currently has an Industry Rank in the bottom 10  overall  while the retail sector is in the bottom 20  too  Clearly  this isn t a great combination  and investors might be better served by looking elsewhere for exposure in the retail space  But  if you are looking for a short candidate or a more concrete example of this trend  consider a closer look at Ethan Allen Interiors  NYSE        

Why ETH  

	Although Ethan Allen shares have held up better than most in the face of the onslaught of negative news in the retail market  there is plenty of reason to be concerned about the company  even beyond its sluggish industry rank  That is because this furniture store chain just missed earnings estimates in its most recent report  posting earnings of just 23 cents per share compared to estimates of 27 cents per share 

	Furthermore  analysts have been slashing their expectations for Ethan Allen Interiors in the near future  as we haven t seen any estimates go higher for the current quarter or the current year in the past two months  Instead  we have seen several analysts move their estimates lower  including four for the current quarter and five for the current year

On a Jet Plane  Global Week Ahead

	In the Global Week Ahead  President Trump will jet off on a 9 day foreign trip  His inaugural diplomatic trip on Air Force One begins on Thursday 
	This first presidential trip abroad features stops in Saudi Arabia  Israel  Italy and Belgium    and Mr  Trump s first appearances at both NATO and G7 summits of major powers 
	This is the high level political world  And it is no longer spinning around a U S  axis  and probably hasn t for some time  That will become even more apparent as this first U S  Presidential trip unfolds 

	In addition  it turns out that  in the week ahead  many world leaders outside the U S  are gaining strength 


			Enjoying strong election results  Germany and France are staying in the centrist camp  Their leaders hold their first formal meeting on Monday 



			Japan s Prime Minister is about to enjoy 5 straight quarter of uninterrupted GDP growth  the first run of that in 11 years 



			And Iran s moderate President is up for re election on Friday 


Let s step thru the non U S  scenario unfolding 
	Germany s leader Angela Merkel hosted the new French President Emmanuel Macron for their first meeting after his inauguration 
	Bloomberg wrote that Merkel is  clawing back when it counts   Her party s election victory in Germany s most populous state on Sunday highlights her pull among voters 
	Merkel vows to hold the European Union together  defend free trade  and rebuff Trump s pressure to accelerate defense spending 
	After 12 years in office  this election victory confirms Merkel s standing    before she heads to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  and Group of Seven  G7  summits in Brussels and Sicily next week 
	On Thursday in Asia  it should appear that Japanese Prime Minister Abe s economic policies are working  Analysts look to Japan s Q1 17 GDP numbers for confirmation of strong economic expansion 
	Market consensus pegs annualized Japanese GDP growth at  1 8     roughly a percentage point above its long run trend  according to Bloomberg 
	Another positive quarterly Japanese GDP figure would mark five consecutive quarters of growth    the first time in 11 years 
	On Friday  Iran s moderate president Hassan Rouhani seeks a second term  He is the leader who struck the historic deal to remove nuclear sanctions 
	To close out a prepatory week in diplomacy  on Saturday  21 Asia Pacific trade ministers meet in Hanoi  Vietnam  They look to launch freer trade in that region 

	This has long been the case  Since World War II  U S  economic partners  established treaties and long term military alliance structures are the pillars  They project and maintain stable power relationships across the globe 
	Fewer global political risks lower the thresholds to higher global GDP growth   enjoyed by all the political players in the system 
	Let s see 
	Can this first jet set trip abroad help to regain that enduring  seven decade old perspective   for a new and inexperienced U S  President   after it is over Fresh Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks  1  Unilever   NYSE        Think about Europe  where share valuations are lower  This monster  92 billion market cap Consumer Staples stock also carries a long term Zacks VGM score of B 

 2  Syngenta AG   NYSE        This is a large Swiss agrochemical and seeds company  with  42 billion in market capitalization  Here s the big news  the Chinese seek to increase agricultural sector productivity by buying this company 
	In recent weeks  ChemChina announced results for their tender offer to purchase all publicly held registered shares of Syngenta and all outstanding American Depositary Shares  ADRs  
	On May 4th  around 82 2  of Common Shares have been validly tendered  The Minimum Acceptance Rate condition of 67  of issued Syngenta shares has been satisfied  In short  the Chinese tender offer has been successful 

 3  Shin Etsu Chemical   OTCMKTS        This stock is all about global semiconductor suppliers staying HOT  This Japanese firm is engaged in the production and distribution of polyvinyl chloride and silicon wafers 
	The company s products include of polyvinyl chloride  silicones  rare earths  rare earth magnets  epoxy molding compounds  synthetic Quartz  semiconductor silicon and cellulose derivatives 
	Shin Etsu Chemical Co   Ltd  is headquartered in Tokyo  Japan

Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country   A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below 
Industrial Machinery by Nation
The United States  The country s industrial production in January grew 0 1  year over year while increasing 0 4  in February  driven by improvements in manufacturing and mining outputs  partially offset by fall in utilities outputs 
New export orders for the U S  manufactured machinery have risen 2 9   according to the U S  Census Bureau report released in Apr 2017  However  a 0 2  fall has been recorded in export demand for machinery in first two months of 2017 due to a decline of 5 3  in shipments of construction machinery  22 4  in mining machinery and 1 1  in industrial machinery 
Also  the job market showed improvement in the first three months of 2017  as the unemployment rate declined from 4 8  in January to 4 5  in March  Job additions were 98 000 in March while average job addition in the past three months was 177 667  Citing improvement in economic activities  the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates in March  This  in turn  will make capital investments more expensive and hence might weigh on businesses for industrial products makers 
Per its Jan 2017 report  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  increased its growth projections for the U S  economy by 10 basis points  bps  to 2 3  for 2017 and 0 4 bps to 2 5  for 2018 
Japan  According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months  increased 0 3  in fourth quarter 2016 while is anticipated to grow 1 5  in first quarter 2017  Orders from manufacturing clients are predicted to grow 9 7  while the same from the government clients are expected to increase 2 9  
As revealed  core machinery orders declined 3 2  in January 
The country s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels  unfavorable exchange rates  aging population and a huge public debt  Also  the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015 
In addition  the country is facing weak economic conditions externally  However  efforts to improve wages and hence  demand as well as to increase investments domestically and fight deflation might work in the country s favor in the quarters ahead 
The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 0 8  for 2017 while it remained stable at 0 5  for 2018 
China  China s GDP grew  6 9  from the year earlier period in Q1  coming in better than expected  Though the country is still struggling with capital outflows and forex issues  a slight improvement in infrastructure investment  retail sales and higher oil prices have worked in its favor 
In the first two months of 2017  the country s industrial production increased 6 3  year over year  above 6  recorded in December  The increase was driven by an improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector 
For 2017  the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6 5  in 2017 and 6  in 2018 
India The country sindustrial production in Jan 2017 increased 2 7  year over year  as against a decline of 0 1  registered in the previous month 
Expectations of a strong demand  improved policies and better monsoon conditions are the factors that will influence the country s growth  going forward  The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world  Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country  these strategies will improve the domestic job market as well as demand for industrial products 
According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 2  in 2017 and 7 7  in 2018 
Brazil  In 2016  the country suffered from adverse impacts of low private investments  inadequate infrastructure  mounting unemployment  high interest rates and political uncertainties  For the quarter ended Feb 2017  the country s unemployment rate was 13 2   higher than 11 9  in the three months ended Nov 2016  Also available data reveals that the country s industrial production fell 0 8  year over year in Feb 2017 
The IMF expects the country s output to inch up a mere 0 2  in 2017 and 1 5  in 2018  The recovery is dependent on foreign direct investments and expansion of industries like tourism  steel and electricity 
Eurozone  Industrial production in the Eurozone declined 0 3  in February from the prior month while rising 1 2  year over year  The unemployment rate was 9 5  in February 
The IMF predicts output growth in Euro Area to be 1 6  in 2017  up 10 bps over the previous forecasts and grow 1 6  in 2018
Zacks Industry Rank
According to the Zacks Industry classification  Machinery is broadly grouped under Industrial Products  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of the earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit  
As a rule  top 50  industries of all Zacks industries outperform the bottom half by a wide margin  Going by this rule  industries with Zacks Industry Rank of 132 and lower would fall in the top half while those with Zacks Industry Rank of 133 and higher would be in the bottom half 
The machinery industry is sub divided into nine industries at the expanded level  machine tools and related products  carrying a Zacks Industry Rank of 11   construction and mining  26   electrical utilities  4   electronics  79   farm  26   general industries  99   material handling  56   print trading  114 and thermal products  4  
Going by the Zacks rule  we see that the sub industries of industrial machinery industry fall in the top half  These sub industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry 
Earnings Trend of the Sector
As per the  report dated Apr 6  roughly 4 5  of industrial products stocks  accounting for 2  of the S P 500 index s total market capitalization  in the S P 500 Group reported results for the Jan Mar 2017 quarter  recording growth of 4 3  in earnings and 5 3  growth in revenues  In the quarter  earnings and revenues of industrial products stocks are predicted to rise by 5 8  and 7 3   respectively 
Moreover  results of all S P 500 companies released through Apr 6 showed 14 5  growth in earnings and 5 1  rise in revenues  In the January March quarter  earnings for the S P 500 companies are projected to grow 6 5  and revenues are expected to rise 6 3  
Conclusion
The IMF anticipates the world economy to grow 3 4  in 2017  including 1 9  growth for advanced economies and 4 5  growth for emerging nations  With the ebbing impacts of prevalent uncertainties globally  the world economy is projected to grow 3 6  in 2018  including 2  growth for advanced nations and 4 8  improvement for emerging countries 
In the quarters ahead  we believethat governmental policies encouraging better trade relations  increase in infrastructural investments  job creation and high consumer end demand will support growth for industrial machinery stocks  It will be interesting to watch the activities of companies  with at least  20 billion market capitalization  including Illinois Tool Works Inc  NYSE ITW    ITW   Parker Hannifin Corp   Ingersoll Rand PLC  IR   Fortive Corp   FTV  and Rockwell Automation 
In the S P 500 group  a major machinery company is Deere   Company  NYSE DE   DE   It has a market capitalization of  35 4 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  The company s long term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population  rising living standards  investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies  In the next three to five years we anticipate earnings to grow 7 58  
Roper Technologies  Inc   ROP  also sports a Zacks Rank  1  Its earnings are predicted to grow 12 33  in the next three to five years

Globally  heavy industries will remain weak  with sporadic growth in the consumer and automotive verticals  The U S  and China will continue to be the weakest geographies Spending in the architecture and software segment has been increased as the company focuses on new product development  Given that the company expects sequential growth in the second half of the year in the segment  it anticipates fiscal third quarter 2016 to witness the lowest margin this year at the segment Despite the weakening oil and gas  mining markets  Rockwell Automation remains optimistic about the consumer  life sciences and auto verticals  These will continue to grow which bodes well for the company  Moreover  its perked up restructuring activities should begin to pay off during this quarter as well as the next

Goldman Sachs has been forecasting a weak market for this year since November  Most recently   lowered the outlook on equities to  underweight  for three months and has a  neutral  outlook for a one year frame  Goldman s latest 2016 target is 2 100  down about 3 7  from the current level  read    
Overvaluation is plaguing both equities and fixed income this year  Both are rallying in a jittery market  Global macroeconomic doldrums especially in Europe  overall global growth issues  election in the U S  and last but not the least sudden geopolitical shocks have given a boost to safe asset U S  Treasuries  but may spoil the sport for stocks 
On the other hand  some solid U S  economic readings  signs of a slowly abating earnings recession  reduced worries in the oil patch and relatively better banking earnings despite low levels of yields and improving tech earnings favored risk on sentiments recently and stocks soared 
However  investors should note that the recent ascent in the market was not at all free of fear as trading volume remains a little weak and low volatility ETFs marched ahead even in the bull market  read    
What s Goldman s Take Now 
Goldman is now expecting the yield on the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury to rise from about  this year on the Fed hike speculation  In such a scenario  Goldman Sachs Chief U S  Equity Strategist David Kostin laid out some winning investing techniques  These are 
Focus on Dividend Growth
Goldman likes  companies where there is above average dividend yields and the dividend is expected to be quite robust over the next couple years   This is especially useful if there are chances of a Fed rate hike 
One can play this trend by investing in PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio   TO PEY    The fund qualifies both factors   dividend growth and higher annual yield of about 3 16   read    
Other dividend growers like SPDR S P Dividend ETF   TO SDY   with 2 35  yield  WisdomTree U S  Dividend Growth ETF  with 2 18  yield and First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend ETF  with 2 67  yield can also be followed if turbulence hits the market  read    
Options for low volatility  high dividend ETFs  namely PowerShares S P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio ETF  with 3 26  yield and FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund  with 2 79  yield also are there 
Focus on Revenue Growth 
 Companies that have posted revenue growth of 10 percent or more  but are trading below 7 5 times enterprise value to sales  are on Goldman s wish list  In this segment  Goldman especially highlighted companies like Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and PayPal 
Now  first  this idea can be played by ETFs heavy on those afore mentioned stocks 
For Alphabet  there is PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio ETF  
For Amazon  there are VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   and Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund  
For PayPal  there is Guggenheim Spin Off ETF  AX CSD   
The other option is to play with revenue weighted ETFs like RevenueShares Large Cap Fund   MU RWL   and Oppenheimer Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF  These ETFs pick constituents on the basis of revenue earned by companies instead of market cap  read

127424,348939,ROK,The Rise Of Robotic Factories  Upsides And Downsides For Investors,opinion,"The machines are rising up   
To new levels of industrial productivity 
Robotic factories are revitalizing American industry  But for many workers   and vocal politicians   this isn t the rebirth they hoped for 
Recent advances in automation have hiked up productivity    but they haven t done much to bring back blue collar factory jobs 

As far as what this means for investors   
The rise of robotic factories is cause for bullishness in some markets   and bearishness in others  Below  we ll examine some of the winners and losers of automation 

The Companies Behind the Machines
It should come as no surprise that factory robot makers have been doing well as of late  Recent technological breakthroughs have helped spawn a new generation of multitasking robots  They re boosting efficiency while reducing overhead costs  And heavy industry is shelling out for them like crazy 
Two companies profiting majorly from this demand are ABB Ltd  NYSE ABB  and Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  

ABB is a Swiss Swedish industrial firm with a large presence in the United States  The company is a market leader in robotic multitaskers  It s also well diversified within the high tech space  Other ABB divisions provide wireless network support and power generation services 
Rockwell is the world s largest industrial automation company  Recently  it has been making waves with its foray into  connected equipment 
These two firms have pioneered the development of robotic factories  It s no wonder they re both up by more than 15  this year 
A Bad Time to Sell Workman s Comp
The recent productivity boom from robotic factories has been harder on insurers  Worker s compensation is  or at least was  one of the most important products they sold 
The problem is    robots don t need it 
According to a report by Fitch Ratings  insurance companies have sustained yearly losses for most of the 2010s as a result 
That s bad news for insurers who rely heavily on workman s comp revenue  Two of the biggest sellers are American International Group Inc  NYSE AIG  and The Hartford Financial Services Group  NYSE HIG   Both stocks have had negative returns this year 

Long term  the impact of robotic factories and automation will be so far reaching that it s impossible to summarize in just one piece  We ll be following up on this trend as new aspects emerge ",2016-09-01,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-rise-of-robotic-factories:-upsides-and-downsides-for-investors-200151213,200151213

127451,348966,ROK,Top 4 Industrial Stocks Likely to Beat Q1 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"The initial quarter of 2016 was plagued by the same headwinds that had adversely influenced the previous four quarters  While economic uncertainties prevailed in some major developing and developed nations  soft commodity prices and adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency movements kept growth momentum restricted for a few industries   

As a result of the weakening health of the global economy  the International Monetary Fund   IMF   lowered its world economic outlook to 3 2  for 2016 and 3 5  for 2017  Economic growth forecasts for advanced and emerging economies have been lowered by 20 basis points  bps  for 2016 and 10 bps for 2017 

Narrowing down to the U S  markets  results of all S P 500 companies released till Apr 20 showed a  9  fall in earnings and a meager  0 6  increase in revenues compared with the year ago quarter  Conditions are unlikely to improve  with earnings for the S P 500 companies projected to fall 9 4   versus 6 1  decline recorded in the previous quarter  Revenues are likely to edge down 80 bps  better than the decline of 3 2  in fourth quarter 2015 
Industrial Products Stocks  Q1 16 Any Different from  15 Quarters 

Though the impact of macro headwinds seemed to have eased a bit  we believe industrial products stocks are still negatively influenced by them  Talking of the industrial production in the U S   an annual fall of 2 2  was recorded in first quarter 2016 compared with 3 4  in the previous quarter  Also  unfavorable foreign currency movements and economic uncertainties were major concerns for these stocks 

As of Apr 20  roughly 14 3  of industrial products stocks in the S P 500 Group reported results for the Jan Mar quarter  recording a mere 1 7  and 1 5  growth in earnings and revenues  respectively  Taking into consideration the prevalent headwinds  earnings for the Industrial Products sector are expected to decline 24 9  in the quarter  while revenues will likely fall 9 4   Amid such an uncertain environment  choosing the right stocks with a potential to beat earnings estimates can be a daunting task 
Guide to Select the Right Stock

The Industrial Products sector includes containers   glass  industrial products   services  machinery electrical  machinery and pollution control industries  In this diversified sector  stocks with high investment rankings can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the sector  But it is advisable to choose stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  and a positive   the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   as these two factors increase the probability of a stock surprising estimates in the quarter 

Below we have listed four Industrial Products stocks  currently equipped with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for Jan Mar quarter 
John Bean Technologies Corporation    NYSE JBT     The company  has a  1 7 billion market capitalization  and primarily deals with providing solutions to the food processing and air transportation industries  The company has a solid customer base in the U S  and internationally 

The company  with a Zacks Rank  1 and a positive Earnings ESP of 13 33   seems a suitable pick for investors seeking exposure in this industry  Moreover  the stock promises solid return of 46 7  on equity and 17 3  on investments  These prospects are again supported by the company s efforts to improve its services and build a sound customer base  Dividend yield presently stands at 0 7  

The stock is currently valued at a forward P E multiple of 25 29   The company s solid return profile and estimated 5 year earnings growth rate of 15  improve its prospects

The stock  with a Zacks Rank  1 and a positive Earnings ESP of 100   seems a good investment option  In addition  the stock offers return of 7 8  on equity and 3  on assets  Profitability growth is supported by the company s geographically diversified business and a large client base  The stock is currently valued at a forward P E multiple of 17 68 versus 18 02 for the industry

Rockwell Automation Inc     NYSE ROK     The company  with a  15 1 billion market capitalization  is an original equipment manufacturer of industrial automation equipment  application specific integrated software and consulting design services 

As suggested  the industrial equipment maker is worth considering as it carries a favorable Zacks Rank  3 and a positive Earnings ESP of 3 03   Also  the stock promises solid returns of 35  on equity and 21 5  on investments  Prospects are supported by the company s efforts to diversify its sales stream  improve quality and build a sound partner network  Dividend yield currently stands at 2 52  

The stock is currently valued at a forward P E multiple of 19 71 versus 19 10 for the industry  Despite this  the company s solid return profile  low debt position  debt to equity of 66 8  as compared with 151 7  for the industry and estimated 5 year earnings growth rate of 7 59  enhances its investment value 

Rockwell Automation is slated to release second quarter fiscal 2016  ended Mar 2016  results on Apr 27  before the market opens 
Regal Beloit Corporation    NYSE RBC     The company is engaged in manufacture and distribution of electric motors  electrical motion controls  and power generation and transmission products  The company has a vast client base in the U S  as well as in foreign markets  Currently  the company has a market capitalization of  3 billion

Regal Beloit Corporation will release first quarter 2016 results on May 9  after the market closes 
Going Forward

Effective governmental policies as well as huge investments in infrastructure development can improve industrial products demand and also create new jobs  Until we ride through the difficult economic environment  choosing some possible winners on the basis of a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP might work wonders for some interested investors this earnings season

First quarter 2016 results seem to be hindered by the same headwinds that had adversely influenced the previous four quarters  While economic uncertainties prevailed in some major developing and developed nations  soft commodity prices and adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency moves kept the growth momentum restricted for a few industries in the first quarter 

As a result of the weakening health of the global economy  the International Monetary Fund   IMF   lowered its world economic outlook to 3 2  for 2016 and 3 5  for 2017  Economic growth forecasts for advanced and emerging economies have been lowered by 20 basis points  bps  for 2016 and 10 bps for 2017 
	The level of industrial activity is measured in terms of industrial production  which comprises the output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below The United States
	We believe industrial products stocks in the U S  are negatively influenced by the prevailing macro headwinds  Industrial production in the country fell roughly 2 2  in first quarter 2016 as compared with a 3 4  decline in the previous quarter  The job market showed relative weakness in the quarter  evident from an average jobs addition of 209 000 per month  down compared with 282 000 in the preceding quarter 
	To add to the woes  unfavorable foreign currency movements and economic uncertainties worldwide led to weak export demand for U S  manufactured machinery  According to the U S  Census Bureau  export demands for U S  machinery declined 1 6  year over year for the first two months of 2016  A 12 1  decline was recorded for shipments of farm machinery  while construction and mining machinery saw a 24 4  and 44 9  fall  The exception was a 22 7  increase in shipments of industrial machinery 
	New machinery orders were down 0 9   while order backlog decreased 8 3  
	The International Monetary Fund   IMF   has reduced its growth projections for the U S  economy by 20 basis points  bps  to 2 4  for 2016 and by 10 bps to 2 5  for 2017 Japan
	The country s economy is struggling with its internal issues as well as facing the adversities of weak economic conditions externally  Low investment levels  unfavorable exchange rates  aging population and a huge public debt are some headwinds affecting the country s progress 

According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders fell nearly 9 2  in February as against the previous month s growth of 15   The fall in core machinery orders has triggered concerns over the future of capital investments by companies 
	Orders from manufacturing clients declined 30 6  while the same from the government clients grew 25 9   The agency predicts core machinery orders to grow 6 4  in the first quarter 2016  while total machinery orders are expected to increase 2 2  
	The IMF predicts the economy to grow by 0 5  in 2016  inching down by 10 bps in 2017  These projections reflect a 50 bps and 40 bps downward revisions from previous forecasts for 2016 and 2017  respectively Emerging NationsChina    In first quarter 2016  China s GDP grew 1 1  sequentially  below the 1 5  growth recorded for fourth quarter 2015  while on a year over year basis increased 6 7  versus 6 8  in the year ago period  Despite the fall  the country s economy seems to be stabilizing 
	In March  the country s industrial production increased 6 8  year over year  an improvement from the 5 4  average growth for January and February  The increase was driven by an improvement in mining  manufacturing and utilities sectors  Also  the country s exports increased 11 5   Imports dropped 7 6  
	The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow by 6 5  in 2016 and 6 2  in 2017  reflecting a 20 bps increase over the previous projections India  The country s industrial production in Feb 2016 increased 2  year over year  Expectations of strong demand  improved policies and better monsoon conditions are factors that will influence the country s growth going forward  The new government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world 
	Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country  these strategies will serve to improve the domestic job markets as well as demand for industrial products  According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 7 5  in both 2016 and 2017 Brazil  For 2016  the country projects a gloomy outlook as a result of low private investments and inadequate infrastructure  The country s unemployment rate increased to 10 9  in first quarter 2016  up from 9  recorded in the quarter ending Dec 2015  Also available data reveals that the country s industrial production fell 9 8  year over year in February 
	The IMF predicts the country s output to decline by 3 8  in 2016  remaining flat in 2017  The recovery is dependent on foreign direct investments and expansion of industries like tourism  steel and electricity Eurozone
	Industrial production in the Eurozone fell 0 8  month over month in Feb 2016 while inched up 80 bps year over year  Though the unemployment rate was high at 10 2  in Mar 2016  it represented a 20 bps improvement over the rate of 10 4  in February 
	The IMF revised down its growth projections for the Euro Area by 20 bps to 1 5  for 2016 and by 10 bps to 1 6  for 2017 Zacks Industry Rank
	According to the Zacks Industry classification  Machinery is broadly grouped under Industrial Products  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of the earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit  
	As a rule  the top 50  industries of all Zacks industries outperform the bottom half by a wide margin  Going by this rule  industries with Zacks Industry Rank of 132 and lower would fall in the top half  while those with Zacks Industry Rank of 133 and higher would be in the bottom half 
	The machinery industry is sub divided into 9 industries at the expanded level  machine tools and related products  construction and mining  electrical utilities  electrical  farm  general industries  material handling  print trading and thermal processing Earnings Trend of the Sector
	As of May 9th  we have Q1 results from 95 2  of the companies in the S P 500 s Industrial Products sector  Total earnings for these Industrial Products companies are down  21 3  from the same period last year on  8 6  lower revenues  with 70  of the companies beating EPS estimates and equal proportion coming ahead of revenue expectations  For the quarter as a whole  total earnings for the sector are expected to be down  22 8  on  9 4  revenues 
	The trend of earnings declines is expected to continue for the sector  with Industrial Products earnings in the June quarter expected to be down  7 2  on  5 4  lower revenues Key Players in the Machinery Industry
	Stocks with high investment rankings might interest investors who seek exposure in the machinery industry  Below we have briefly discussed some stocks that hold strong long term potential and a high investment ranking of Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
	In the S P 500 group  machinery company Xylem Inc      with a market capitalization of  7 5 billion  has strong earnings growth potential  roughly 10 6  over the next five years  Another machinery company  Pentair plc     with  10 5 billion market capitalization  offers 9 7  earnings growth  Industrial robotic company Rockwell Automation Inc      with  14 9 billion market capitalization  offers 7 6  long term earnings growth 
	Other billion dollar stocks in the S P 500 group with Zacks Rank  2 and long term earnings growth rate in excess of 7  include Parker Hannifin Corporation    and Ingersoll Rand Plc    Going Forward
	We believe global uncertainties will likely restrict the growth of machine and tool manufacturers  going forward  The much needed improvement in the economy as well as industrial products sector can only be achieved on the back of effective governmental policies  huge infrastructural investments  creation of more jobs and emphasis on trade relations
