on this call  Thank you for your interest in Aimco  Last year was a good year for Aimco  as we detailed in the earnings release published yesterday afternoon  And while I m delighted by these good results  I am even more energized by the bright prospects for Aimco in 2020 and beyond We expect to meet or beat the 2020 forecast we made last fall and to finish this year with further growth in prospect for 2021 and thereafter  Aimco has an advantage of world class property operations  value creating redevelopments  accretive investments in real estate  long dated and low cost non recourse property debt  and high performing cohesive team  In the next few minutes  Keith  Wes and Paul will detail their solid performance in 2019  and our high expectations for 2020  And with that I offer my Aimco teammates many and sincere you re thanks for what we accomplished last year and for the success we see ahead for this year For more details  I d like to turn the call over to Keith Kimmel  Head of Property Operations  Keith Keith M  Kimmel    Executive Vice President Property OperationsThanks Terry  I m pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter in operations  Our operating philosophy begins with a relentless focus on customer selection  and exceptional customer service  We continue to refine and execute this playbook every day  and it leads to lower turnover  higher occupancy  better pricing power  maximize revenues  avoiding costs and better margin Based on more than 13 000 surveys in the fourth quarter  customer satisfaction was 4 3 out of five stars  This is the first time we ve achieved this mark  and indicative of our continued drive to deliver a world class resident experience  This dedication to customer service means that residents want to live with us longer  leading to our lowest turnover on record  43 2   a 150 basis point improvement year over year  As a result  our average daily occupancy was an Aimco best  97 4   40 basis points better than 2018  and we accelerated throughout the quarter  from 97 1  in October to 97 9  in December  This approach translated to solid top line growth  with revenues up 3 3  for the quarter  our top markets with growth over 4 5  were Denver  Philadelphia  Washington DC  and Boston  Solid markets with growth over 1 5   were San Diego  Los Angeles  Atlanta  the Bay Area and Miami  Finally  markets with growth of 50 basis points to 1   were New York  Chicago and Seattle Now turning to expenses  controllable operating expenses were flat for 2019  and up 2 1  in the fourth quarter  due to lower marketing and turn costs from improved retention  offset by higher investments in our communities  Total expenses were up 2 4  for the year and grew 4 4  in the quarter  driven by taxes and utilities  As a result  fourth quarter net operating income grew 2 9   and margins were 74 8   For the full year  our margin was 73 7   a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 Looking at leases which transacted in the quarter  new lease rates were up 70 basis points  Renewal rates were up 5   and same store blended lease rates were up 2 4   30 basis points better than 2018 As we look at our preliminary January results  we are tracking toward a solid start to our 2020 plan  Blended lease rates are up 2 5   New lease is up 1   120 basis points better than 2019  Renewals up 5 6   a 70 basis point improvement  all while achieving average daily occupancy of 97 8   some 80 basis points better than last year Finally  turning to our 2020 outlook  we see another solid year  Our top markets with planned revenue growth of 3 5  to 5   are Philadelphia  Seattle  Austin  Washington DC  San Diego and Miami  We expect growth of 2 5  to 3 5  in Atlanta  Denver Los Angeles and the Bay Area  and revenue growth of 1 5  to 2 5  in New York and Chicago  To the operations team  thank you for your dedication to innovation and a passion for serving our residents I ll now turn the call over to Wes Powell  our Executive Vice President Redevelopment  Wes Wes Powell    Executive Vice President  RedevelopmentThanks Keith  Today  I will provide a brief summary of our 2019 portfolio management and investment activities  and will also discuss our plans for 2020  Details on fourth quarter activity can be found within our release In 2019  Aimco continued with its paired trade strategy  reallocating capital from lower rent growth markets such as suburban Chicago and from properties that produce lower operating margins without the opportunity for value creating reinvestment  That capital was redeployed into higher growth markets such as Miami  Denver  Cambridge and San Francisco  While improving upon our geographic allocation and to also increase its rate of investment  During the past year   230 million was invested in redevelopment and development projects  up 30  year over year  This activity creates shareholder value  and will lead to accelerated earnings growth when apartments are completed and leased  In 2019  Aimco delivered 335 new or fully renovated homes  of these  more than 80  are currently leased at rental rates ahead of our underwriting Now turning to 2020  AImco expects to increase in annual investment in redevelopment and development between  250 million and  300 million  creating approximately  100 million of shareholder value  During the year  we plan to complete construction on approximately 500 homes  whose run rate contribution at stabilization will be  17 5 million in annual revenues  Flamingo Point s North Tower will remain under construction through 2020  and when its 366 homes are occupied and stabilized  they will contribute over  14 million of annual revenue  in a submarket with strong growth prospects  Additionally we retain a deep pipeline and plan to commence new redevelopment projects during the year and look forward to providing details on those  when the time is right Finally  we will continue to seek accretive opportunities outside of our existing portfolio  where we can earn superior returns as a result of key operational excellence  value creating redevelopment  and ideally both  Any new investments will be funded on a leverage neutral basis from the sale of communities with lower forecasted free cash flow IRRs  And with thanks to all of my teammates for their continued hard work and constant pursuit of value creating opportunities I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Beldin  our Chief Financial Officer  Paul Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Wes  Today  I m going to give a quick recap of 2019 results  provide details on our 2020 guidance  discuss our balance sheet and comment on Aimco s 2020 dividend First 2019 same store NOI growth of 4 3  was 70 basis points better than our guidance of one year ago  driven by 50 basis points of better than expected revenue growth  The strong same store growth reported by Keith and the accretive investments discussed by Wes  contributed to full year AFFO being  0 03 per share  ahead of the midpoint of guidance provided at the beginning of the year Looking back  it is informative to recall  that Aimco s year over year AFFO growth for the first three quarters of 2019 was impacted by the July 2018 in sale of the Asset Management business  With the dilution from the sale behind us  fourth quarter AFFO grew by 12   We expect the strong growth to continue in 2020  Aimco expects AFFO to be between  2 34 and  2 44 per share  representing  0 19 per share or 9  growth at the midpoint  Approximately  0 13 of this growth is expected from Aimco same store portfolio  with NOI growth between 3 2  and 4 6   The remaining  0 06 of growth is primarily due to a  0 06 net contribution from the mezzanine loan made to the partnership that owns Parkmerced and  0 04 of incremental AFFO from our redevelopment and development communities  offset by approximately  0 05 of dilution from properties sold to fund our investments  Please keep in mind  the  0 04 net contribution from our redevelopment and development communities  is expected to increase after consideration of funding costs  by another  0 18 per share  as these properties are stabilized over the following three years Next I d like to discuss the components of our expected same store NOI growth  We forecast 2020 same store revenue growth between 3  and 3 8   Our revenue growth expectations are based on the following  the earn in from our 2019 leasing activities is expected to contribute 130 basis points to 2020 revenue growth  The contribution of 2020 leasing activities is dependent upon a number of factors  including resident satisfaction and quality  retention percentages  lease space  and lease rates  We expect these factors to add 170 to 250 basis points to year over year revenue growth  Limited lease rates are expected to be similar to or better than the 3 4  achieved in 2019 Over the full year  we expect average daily occupancy to increase in 2020  but at a slower pace than the 60 basis point improvement achieved in 2019  While January is not yet complete and January results are not yet fully available  we are encouraged by what we do know  For example January 2020 average daily occupancy was up by 80 bps Turning to same store expense growth  we expect total same store expense growth of 1 6  to 2 4   Of these costs  we expect controllable operating expenses to be up by 50 basis points or less  Aimco s relentless focus on innovation and customer service has resulted in no increase in controllable operating expenses for more than a decade Now  turning to our balance sheet  in the fourth quarter  Aimco sold four communities  generating net proceeds of  201 million  Another  300 million of year end January sales were delayed  This delay increased our leverage to EBITDA ratio by three tenths of a turn  but we expect better pricing this year  as the transaction market remains deep  liquid and attractively priced Our leverage to EBITDA ratio is above our target of 7 0  but we expect this to be temporary  In 2020  we expect to repay approximately  550 million of leverage  funded by property sales and still reduce leverage to EBITDA by approximately one turn Looking into the future  we expect continued same store NOI growth and an incremental  27 million contribution from our redevelopment and development investments  to further reduce our leverage to EBITDA ratio by another turn or more  Finally  after a solid 2019 and with strong FFO growth expected for 2020  the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of  0 41 per share  a 5  increase over the regular quarterly dividends paid in 2019 With that  we will now open up the call for questions  Please limit your questions to two per time in the queue  Rocco  I ll turn it over to you for the first question Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  sir   Operator Instructions   Today s first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi  Please go ahead Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystThanks Rocco  Wondering if we could get a little more color on the decision to delay the asset sales  and maybe where were you in the process  when you made that decision Lisa R  Cohn    Executive Vice President  General Counsel and SecretaryRocco  it s Lisa Cohn  Thanks for the question  We have a number of properties in the market as we did at end of the last year  and we re just looking for the best execution in terms of pricing  So we presently have a couple under contract and we re just going to keep looking to get the lowest cost of capital  And I think Paul said in his prepared remarks  we have a broad group of buyers and lots of people looking and those markets are deep and liquid  and we think we ll get the pricing we re looking for this year Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystSo when you initially took them out  the market  the pricing just wasn t what you thought it should be  Is that essentially what you re saying Lisa R  Cohn    Executive Vice President  General Counsel and SecretaryI mean  we didn t have to sell them at that moment  and there    we re looking to maximize price  and deals have ebbs and flows and things happen as people go through due diligence  And so we have the opportunity to make that decision Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  Then what does guidance assume in terms of the timing of the asset sales this year Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Nick  this is Paul  We expect to sell the  950 million of properties at the midpoint of our range  Throughout the course of the year  we expect this first sales will occur late in the first quarter  early second  and then the remainder will proceed through the year  As we get more of these sales under contract with hard money down  we will provide more precise timing Nick Joseph    Citigroup    AnalystThanks OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America  Please go ahead Shirley Wu    Bank of America    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking the question  So my first question has to do with your two markets that you highlighted before  of higher supply in Center City and Mid Wilshire  So in terms of what you re seeing now  have you started to feel the impact in terms of concessions or slower velocity  And then  when you really expect to see the full bulk of that supply to impact your portfolio Keith M  Kimmel    Executive Vice President Property OperationsShirley  this is Keith  I ll start and then if Paul wants to add some more global supply insights  Your particular question around the Mid Wilshire portfolio  we feel really good about where we re positioned there  And most of that supply that s coming in actually in Koreatown  And so where we are particularly located  we think that it s    while it will be impactful in that part of Wilshire  we are further west  and we think that we re in a better spot  and we will keep our eye on it  but we re going into the year in a strong position and feeling good about the look forward in LA  Paul  anything you want to add to that Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJust to comment on Center City  Philadelphia  Shirley as I m sure you ll recall Center City  Philadelphia has seen elevated levels of new supply since 2016  and so the encouraging fact for us  is those levels are continuing to decline  and 2020 is expected to be the lowest year of any of the past five  And during the previous four years  our Center City assets have performed very well  And as Keith highlighted in his prepared remarks  Philadelphia is going to be one of our strongest markets next year Shirley Wu    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  that s helpful  So my next question has to do with    for redevelopment plans  So you ve previously talked about redevelopment for East 88 in New York  So could you tell us a little bit more about  where you are in that process  and what that could potentially look like  once it s built in the product offering Wes Powell    Executive Vice President  RedevelopmentHey Shirley  its Wes  Thanks for the question  You re right that that s a project like many that is in our pipeline  and we re actively pursuing that one  We feel great about the opportunity there  It s kind of a perfect case where we ve owned the property for a long time with high land value  and have the ability to unlock that value  when the time is right  It would be premature to go into details right now  we re still working through the process  But as I think we stated before  it would be a higher density development on that site  And happy to talk about the details when we re ready to announce that one Shirley Wu    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  Thanks for taking my questions OperatorOur next question today comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets  Please go ahead John Kim    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Good morning  Couple of questions on your guidance  so it sounds like you believe blended lease growth rates will be higher year over year and occupancy starting off the year higher as well  Yet you widened your same store guidance  both at the top end and at the bottom end of the range and basically cut the midpoint the same  Why would there not be an upward bias on your same store guidance this year Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey John  this is Paul  Thanks for the question  You re right that our    the midpoint of our guidance that we issued last night was consistent with our preliminary outlook that we published at end of September  As we discussed on the third quarter call  our preliminary outlook really provided a range of where we thought the midpoint of our guidance would land  And so as we were setting guidance for the full year  we continued our historical practice of having about 100 basis point range around our operating metrics  and about a  0 10 range around our earnings metrics or FFO and AFFO  So nothing more than that John Kim    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystIs portfolio mix part of this  And also on a related topic  your capital enhancements guidance is down 30  year over year  And I know that s been a driver    or one of the drivers of same store revenue growth  Is that potentially one of the reasons why you ve widened that range Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  To comment on each of those  the portfolio that we expect to have our same store pool in 2020 is consistent with what we used to form our preliminary outlook  And then in regards to CE  the time that we published our outlook  we were far enough along in the planning process  that we were expecting a decline in our spend in 2020  and that decline is really driven by nothing more than the factoring  both  19 and in 2018  we invested quite a bit of capital in rolling out smart rents and the associated smart technologies  now that we re done with that across the entire portfolio  that investment is coming down John Kim    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets  Please go ahead Austin Wurschmidt    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  Thank you  Back to the disposition delays  were those specific to a single market  or was it a broad based group of assets  And were any of those assets within the group that was under contract as of last quarter s call Lisa R  Cohn    Executive Vice President  General Counsel and SecretaryThey were not any of the assets that were under contract at last quarter s call  those we closed at the end of 2019  and they were in a variety of markets  and not with a single buyer or anything like that Austin Wurschmidt    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that  And then as it relates to Parkmerced  when was the mezz investment funded  Was it at a single period  or is it being sort of funded over a period of time  And then how soon could phase two at Parkmerced get under way  any restrictions  I guess related to phase one getting complete or otherwise Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSure Austin  It was all funded simultaneously at the closing in late November  As to phase two  yeah  it is conditioned on phase one taking place  They are out right now actively rebidding their design plans for Phase 1A and B  and we anticipate that they will proceed through development processes that continues Austin Wurschmidt    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystAnd just one quick follow up  you did  1 5 million of mezz investment income as of the fourth quarter  You annualize that  it gets you to  18 million  a little bit shy of sort of the 27 5 ish that you might expect  What were the offsetting items for that line item Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  this is Paul  You re correct that our mezzanine income that was reported on our income statement was  1 5 million  And what that reflects is the interest that we accrued at the contractual rate of 10  offset by certain costs that were incurred  while originating the loans that were not eligible for deferrals Austin Wurschmidt    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney  Please go ahead Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystGood afternoon  guys  Keith  when you and your team put together your market view for 2020  what market or markets had the biggest delta in terms of the range of potential same store revenue growth outcomes for the year  And is a driver behind the gap  anything other than the amount and timing of new supply Keith M  Kimmel    Executive Vice President Property OperationsRob  Thank you for that  Really when we put it together  we had a stronger pickup when we look at the average daily occupancy from  19 to  20  There is not any particular market that had any particular change or outlook on it  that drove the difference Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystOkay  And then how is your ABC plus portfolio mix going to change  when you factor in the  1 billion of dispositions this year  And then what you re doing and Development  Redevelopment projects under construction and any acquisitions that are in the pipeline  I mean you re now up to 50  A  it s up 300 basis points year over year  How significantly does that accelerate  when you factor in all of these transactions that are coming through for you guys Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Rob  this is Paul  I ll address it and then let anybody else supplement my response  You re right  currently we re about 52   54  As  which is a little bit more heavy than we d prefer  and as part of our redevelopments  a lot of times what happens is that we ll see the greatest opportunity to create value for our shareholders  by taking a community that is in A location  with A dirt  but had a B rental price and so thereby creating value by bringing that community up to an A price point  And so that as a byproduct increases that allocation  But as we look forward  we d like to see a greater allocation to that B price point  And so I think as we go throughout our sales this year  you ll see a mix of sales  we still have a few hundred million of assets that are at that C plus and B price point that will be sold likely in 2020  But there will also be an allocation likely of As  So over the longer term  we will seek to bring that percentage down Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystOkay  So that  1 billion of dispositions  is it primarily just Bs and Cs Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt s a mix  And as Lisa said  we ve seen a lot of interest in the assets that are in the market and we expect to see really attractive pricing so the exact mix will be dependent upon pricing  But we feel very confident about the opportunity we have ahead of us  Okay  So in the near term  you wouldn t expect that    the As to get above 60  or anything  No Rob Stevenson    Janney    AnalystOkay  thanks guys OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Haendel St  Juste from Mizuho  Please go ahead Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystHey  good morning out there Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Haendel Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystSo Terry  can we go back to Parkmerced for a second  And I guess    I know we had a call about it late last year  but I don t think we had all the information that we know now  the assets  cash flow  the existing CMBS loans  So I understand the loan  the attractive coupon you re getting there  the embedded value in the asset  and the accretion from the loan  But we ve also heard some concern from investors  who see it as the latest detour on your ROTE simplifications  as well as concerns about the cash flow shortfall and the inability  at least right now  to fully cover the interest obligations on your mezz fee  So I guess I m curious  how do you and the Board factor all this into your decision process  And is there anything more you want to share  for those who might still have some concerns over the transaction Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerHaendel  First of all  thank you for the question and thank you for your piece this morning  I thought that was thoughtful and and I read whatever 15 or 20 of them  and yours stood out as insightful  As to your question about Parkmerced  it is certainly something that the Board and I and the management team thought about  We feel very comfortable about the balance between risk and reward  We think the downside is  is fairly limited  both as you see from appraisal  but also from the nature of the underlying cash flows of the rent control portfolio  So we feel very good about the downside and the upside from 6 000 entitled units without rent control in San Francisco is a big number  And so  I think we feel pretty good about that Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystOkay  And so it certainly sounds like over the next five years  there is an anticipation that redev and maybe some increased occupancy or rent increases could help cover the shortfall  But if not  you do have a right to force this control    I am sorry  force the sale of the asset  Is that correct Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI m not sure I got the question  But the first part of it  yes  I m completely comfortable that the natural operation of the rent control business will lead to increased cash flows  that will over time cover the cash requirements or the interest rate of the mezz loan  and as we    but there is a second part of your question which I just didn t hear Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystSorry about that  My understanding  and maybe correct me if I m wrong  is that  if that were not to be the case  if there still is a shortfall by year five  you do have a mechanism by which you can potentially force the sale of the asset  Is that right John E  Bezzant    Executive Vice President and Chief Investment OfficerHaendel  this is John  So there is not an explicit forced sale right in the loan agreement  There is obviously a foreclosure right in the loan agreement  if it doesn t get repaid in year five when it s due  then there is a lot of different consequences that will come into play Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystOkay  fair enough  Just one more quickly  is there anything on Brickell and perhaps you can update us on    any updated thoughts or plans  I know you ve been contemplating a range of options  but just curious if there is anything new to share on that front Wes Powell    Executive Vice President  RedevelopmentHaendel  it s Wes  Thanks for the question  I d say again  in terms of the operating asset there  it s continuing to track along  ahead of expectations  we feel good about that  And otherwise  nothing new to report  but we like the optionality and we ll update you  as something comes to me  Phonetic  Haendel St  Juste    Mizuho    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorOur next question today comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman   Associates  Please go ahead Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking my question  Just on the prep  Paul  you just mentioned there some cost component that couldn t be deferred  But as I think about future  what s a good run rate  not just for 2020  but on your assumptions  it looks like this is going to be a slight increase in 2021 as well  What s the cadence of including those costs Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo what we talked about Hardik that  the contribution to 2020 is    AFFO is going to be  0 06 and that s net of the cost of funding  And so  looking forward  we continue to expect to be able to collect a 10  coupon on  275 million  There is a small amount of costs that were eligible to be deferred  and that will offset it slightly  but not to a massive extent Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystJust for clarity  the 6  is not net  that s just the accretion from the    considering the cost of funding  and then you have an additional cost that comes out of the  0 06 Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  the  0 06 is all in benefit to 2020 numbers Hardik Goel    Zelman   Associates    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorAnd our next question today comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC  Please go ahead Richard Anderson    SMBC Nikko    AnalystThanks  good morning  First  a quick modeling question  I see the same store revenue    top line revenue was about  4 million less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter  I understand you had some asset sales  but the same store revenue sequentially was flat versus the third quarter  I m curious as to why there is such a major drop in that line item from about  180 million to about  175 5 million in the fourth quarter Keith M  Kimmel    Executive Vice President Property OperationsHey Rich  it s Keith  I ll start with the flat sequential  and then I ll turn it over to Paul to add the broader look  So when you look at our sequential revenue  while it was flat from Q3 to Q4  what s important to note  there is really two significant components in there  The first one being our net rental income  which is all of our occupancy  our rental rates and that particular piece actually grew by 1  quarter over quarter  That was offset by a number of lower transactions in transaction income from move outs and move in fees  application fees  things of that nature  we would describe that as good  bad news  We retain more residents and had less of that activity  did offset it  that flattened it out  But if you go to the core of the business  it actually grew 1   Paul  what else would you add Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s exactly as I would articulate it  Keith  the one item that I would add  is that decline was expected and is consistent with what Keith has been talking about  kind of too modest to repeat here  and that it s really a function of our operating philosophy and the fact that we re getting customers who are staying with us longer  and who are less apt to create charges that are non recurring and not necessarily good news  like late fees and damage costs Richard Anderson    SMBC Nikko    AnalystWell  good job lowering revenue  Anyway  so a bigger picture question for Terry  and maybe drafting off of Haendel s question a little bit  maybe bigger picture  I m sure you ve heard it  the mezz deal and Brickell and even Indigo a few years ago or whenever it was  are somewhat complex in nature  Indigo has worked out for you  these two are TBD  and people thinking  while this is perhaps the Aimco  Indecipherable   complex stuff and all that sort of stuff  So I thought I d give you the stage on this conference call  to see how you feel about that that response  and whether or not  is there a bigger pipeline of more complicated transactions ahead  or are these somewhat one off and should not be viewed as sort of a return to a more complicated revenue stream that we d recall back many years ago Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRich  Thank you very much  I guess I d like to start by hooking on to your insight that  congratulations on lower revenue  In fact that comes from simplification  And in fact  it comes from our focus not on top line or bad activity  but on contribution and margin  So I think that we are going to stay completely focused on cash and value creation and optionality  and I think that in a market that is as competitive as the current market  where there is lots of capital  lots of new supply  it s very important for us as a company to maintain that kind of focus  which    to give Keith another pat on the back  has resulted in operating expenses excluding taxes being flat for more than a decade  So I m not particularly worried about us getting off track  Those are just built into our culture and our discipline In looking at particular investments to arrive at those goals  we are going to be opportunistic  The amount of opportunity to buy fully marketed deals in a very competitive market is not particularly attractive  And so we will look for deals that have additional optionality  that will lead us to these same goals that we ve been describing Richard Anderson    SMBC Nikko    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  Thanks very much everyone Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Operator Operator Instructions   Today s next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird  Please go ahead Drew Babin    Baird    AnalystHey  good morning  My question on Parc Mosaic  Has that    has it recently kind of    at first occupancy  how is the rate achievement on that and kind of the pace of that going relative to your expectations  And I guess  has there been any change to the expected stabilized yield on that  or kind of your development pipeline as a whole  based on what you re seeing in the market Wes Powell    Executive Vice President  RedevelopmentDre  it s Wes  I ll take a first stab and then turn it over to Keith on some details on the lease up there  But we feel great about Parc Mosaic in Boulder  as you may know  it s a market that is continuing to add jobs at a rapid clip  And pricing has been better than expectation  and we feel that as we move into this year  it will be better yet  In terms of the yields on that  I think we ve talked about a range between 5 5 and 6  but it s early days  and we re not quite sure where it s going to stabilize  But we feel very good about the spread of where that would trade today  may be a 4  or sub 4 cap rate market  But Keith  any additional color Keith M  Kimmel    Executive Vice President Property OperationsDrew  just share sort of the absorption and how it s being received in the market  We were now three buildings that have been delivered  We re approaching 60  pre leased on those units  we are better than 50  occupied  To give you a context  we just got    just started delivering on    the fourth building will be coming soon  and the rates have been right on par  if not  a little bit better  and we re ready to get into peak season  where we think it will be our greatest strength Drew Babin    Baird    AnalystOkay  Then I guess more generally  the rest of your development pipeline  the ground up projects  where do those currently stand on kind of expected yield basis  Maybe give an update there Wes Powell    Executive Vice President  RedevelopmentDrew  It s Wes again  Again on all of those that are in kind of early days  but the range there is generally going to be 150 to 200 plus basis points ahead  of whatever the cap rate in those markets is  So it s for us  looking at the factors of the submarket  So Fremont for example  which is I believe a mid 6 stabilization  But we think again based on early pricing  it could be better than that  The Leahy  which is in Redwood City  will be north of 5  But again  that s different markets  So I d say overall  we feel very good about where pricing is coming in  where demand is coming in  and as those get past kind of a critical mass of lease up  we will give you a better update Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd just  this is Paul  I was just going to add  from an overall perspective  we focus a lot on the expected free cash flow IRRs and for these projects  the returns are all between 9  and 11  Drew Babin    Baird    AnalystOkay  I appreciate the color on that  And Paul  I ve got here  just one question on the debt maturity schedule  I guess quite a bit of secured debt over the years has been pre pay opportunistically  and given the rates available in the secured market right now  probably still makes sense  I guess  can you give some guidance on how much potential debt gets pulled forward to be paid down this year from out years  kind of what s assumed in guidance Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah that s assumed in guidance is the expectation that we have about a  220 million of our 2021 maturities that can be repaid at par during 2020  So we have assumed that that debt will actually be repaid  and that s one of the factors that is lowering our leverage  But we also continue to have ongoing dialog every week with our lenders  and we look for other opportunities to maybe prepay other high cost debt  If we can do so in a manner that is net cash positive to Aimco  So if our interest savings between the time of the debt is prepaid  with a prepayment penalty  and the date at which that debt can be paid off at par  that s a net positive NPV  We will undertake additional refinancing Drew Babin    Baird    AnalystOkay  So to be clear  guidance just implies that  220 million  nothing else  Anything else would be opportunistic Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerCorrect Richard Anderson    SMBC Nikko    AnalystAll right  that s all from me  Thank you OperatorAnd our next question today comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors  Please go ahead John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystThanks  Keith  could you share what you re budgeting for LA Metro revenue growth in 2020 Keith M  Kimmel    Executive Vice President Property OperationsHi John  thanks for the question  We don t    wouldn t give you the exact number  but that falls into our 2 5  to 3 5  range and we    that we believe will fall in there John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystOkay  Maybe a bit more color in that market  I know supply is getting all the headlines right now  But what are you seeing on the demand side  foot traffic and then  what s the concessionary activity in the market  It seems to be slowing pretty rapidly in your sequential numbers  so just curious what you re seeing in the early innings of 2020 Paul L  Beldin    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo John  let me just    I ll walk you through it  First our LA release broken into two pieces  So we have our Ventura portfolio  Simi Valley  and then of course our Mid Wilshire in West LA  Not much supply or concern that really comes out of the Ventura piece  As we think about the Mid Wilshire  we saw occupancy built through the fourth quarter and into January  So just as an example  we started in October at 96 7  and finished January at 97 1   and so we believe that it s actually we re seeing good demand  There is plenty of sufficient demand to meet our needs and the fundamentals for us have been typically been pretty good John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystOkay  And then last one from me  Terry just wondering your thoughts on obviously the balance sheet  how it s structured  there will never be huge financial distress to Aimco  But you would be an outlier versus your peers  in terms of being able to play offense in the next downturn  if we ever get one  So curious how you re going to de risk the company a little bit  so you re not as much of a laggard  because you know  the Eds and Meds in the diversified portfolio resonate  but some steps like buying an office building in Miami  a mezz loan in the Bay Area that s not fully covered  those seem to go against the safe low beta profile  that does resonate well with Aimco  So are there any steps in terms of geography or balance sheet that you re going to take over the next few years  to derisk the company a bit more Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  Thank you  That s a    that s not only a big questions  that s several big question  So I ll try to be responsive  but if I miss one  please  please remind me On the question of the leverage  let me just say  I feel very comfortable with our leverage today  I feel very comfortable with our goal  which is expressed in published guidance to bring it down by a turn by this time next year  and I feel very good in the point    about the point he made  which is just the delivery of these additional units that are in the pipeline  brings it down another turn  So as the natural operation of the business will bring it down to a number in the middle  low fives  which I have no idea where their peers will be at that time  that s a little bit of a moving target  But I think in terms of running the business  not to be comparable to peers  but to be safe and derisk it  I feel good about that  Particularly  of course  with our longer dated and non recourse leverage The second part of that is  remind me what the second part was  In terms of    low beta  I don t know that we would say that our target is low beta  I think there is elements of our business that are quite low beta And there are elements that have great opportunity for value adds  And I would think that in general  what    as I think Wes said in his remarks  we look for ones where you get both  that you have the opportunity for deals you don t lose  which is low beta  But you have some extra opportunity  or potential that leads to    hedge you win  And I don t think there s anything high beta about 1001 Brickell  which is a very stable asset in a very stable market  with good demand and so forth But it has the extra factors that it could turn out to be worth a multiple in terms of land value as opposed to that low beta asset  And so I I would communicate to our shareholders  that we think their expected returns are quite secure  and yet we also think there is an opportunity for something better to happen John Pawlowski    Green Street Advisors    AnalystAll right  Thank you Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen  this concludes the question and answer session  I would like to turn the conference back over to Terry Considine for any final remarks Terry Considine    Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRocco  thank you very much and thank you my friends for your interest in Aimco  If you have further questions  please do call  Many of us will be together in just about a month at Flamingo and on Brickell to look first hand at whether these are safe and low beta or or not  I think you ll be delighted by what you see  And of course  many of us will be together at the Citi Conference in the following week  And so we want to be transparent  keep you posted in what we re doing  and we look forward to being together  Have a great weekend

and 2019 results on Jan 31  after the market closes  While the company s quarterly funds from operations  FFO  per share are expected to have remained flat  its revenues might reflect a year over year decline In the last reported quarter  the Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 1 6  in terms of FFO per share  Results benefited from decent growth in same store property net operating income  NOI  and lower cost of leverage Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history  Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion  reported in line results in another and missed in the other two  It reported an average negative surprise of 0 40   This is depicted in the chart below Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Following a robust prime leasing season in 2019  the U S  apartment rental market put up a decent show in the December end quarter despite the seasonally low demand for apartments during the colder months  as renters usually prefer less to move in winters Per the latest  from RealPage  Inc    NASDAQ RP    apartment occupancy at the end of fourth quarter 2019 was 95 8   reflecting an expansion of 40 basis points  bps   year on year  Moreover  a healthy job market and low unemployment rates drove steady rent growth for the apartment sector in the October December period  In fact  rents for new resident leases were up 2 8  in 2019  hovering around the 3  level that the apartment market has been witnessing since late 2016 These quarterly gains posted by the U S multi family market are anticipated to have supported Aimco s performance during the period under consideration The company s portfolio is diversified both in terms of geography and price point  and situated in some key markets in the United States  This is expected to have enabled it to witness healthy demand in the fourth quarter owing to favorable demographics  household formation and job market growth  Further  efforts to improve portfolio quality and investments in valuable properties are anticipated to have fueled bottom line growth In early December  Aimco announced two transactions related to the partnership which owns Parkmerced Apartments   a 3 221 apartment home community positioned on a 152 acre site in Southwest San Francisco  Specifically  it announced a  275 million loan with accruing annual interest at 10  to the partnership which owns Parkmerced Apartments  This loan will offer current income to Aimco and is expected to have been slightly accretive to fourth quarter 2019 FFO Nevertheless  apartment deliveries might have remained elevated in a number of the company s markets  Continued supply is a concern because it curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption  Such an environment might have resulted in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power for Amico  This is likely to have marred its top line growth  Further  sale of its Asset Management business are expected to have eroded the company s revenues  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  230 53 million  indicating a decline of 0 6  from the year ago quarter reported figure Moreover  Aimco s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019 FFO per share remained unchanged over the past 30 days at 65 cents  For the December end quarter  management projects pro forma FFO per share of 62 66 cents In addition  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 FFO per share is  2 5  Management s outlook for full year pro forma FFO per share is  2 47  2 51 Here is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts a beat in terms of FFO per share for Aimco this season  The combination of a

106114,327629,AIV,What s In Store For Simon Property s  SPG  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Simon Property Group   NYSE SPG   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 30  before the market opens  While the company s results are anticipated to reflect a marginal year over year decrease in revenues  its funds from operations  FFO  per share will likely remain unchanged In the last reported quarter  this Indianapolis  IN based retail real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 0 34  in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected increase in leasing spread per square foot at the company s U S  malls and Premium Outlets In addition  over the trailing four quarters  the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed in the other  the average beat being 0 42   This is depicted in the graph below Simon Property Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    The recent  from Reis shows that the vacancy rate of neighborhood and community shopping center contracted 10 basis points  bps  sequentially to 10 1  in the third quarter  Both  national average asking rent and effective rent  which nets out landlord concessions  inched up 0 3  sequentially  However  the Regional Mall vacancy rate expanded 10 bps sequentially to 9 4   Nonetheless  rent growth was 0 2  in the quarter Admittedly  store closures and bankruptcies have been affecting the retail real estate market  for long  which is  in fact  undergoing structural changes  However  with retail spending being still healthy  with consumer spending increasing amid job growth  the retail real estate sector is expected to have grown at a slow yet steady pace For Simon Property  adoption of an omni channel strategy and successful tie ups with premium retailers has been a saving grace amid this retail apocalypse  The company has been actively restructuring its portfolio  aiming at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments  In fact  for the past years  the company has been investing in billions to transform its properties focused on creating value and drive footfall at the properties  The transformational plans include addition of hotels  restaurants  residences and luxury stores Additionally  the company is undertaking strategic measures to help online retailers fortify their physical presence  besides taking steps to support its omni channel strategy  Simon Property is exploring mixed use development option which has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps catch the attention of people who prefer to live  work and play in the same area During the third quarter  Simon Property announced the opening of Jockey International s first ever pop up retail store at The Edit   Roosevelt Field  Notably  Jockey International is the fifth retailer to enjoy occupancy of an abundantly visible space in one of the premier centers in the United States for product testing and customers  interaction in a new format Simon Property also has a solid and improving balance sheet with ample liquidity  This trend is anticipated to have continued in the third quarter as well Nevertheless  shift in consumers  preferences toward online channels for purchases  bankruptcies and store closures have emerged as pressing concerns for retail REITs and Simon Property is not immune to such choppy environment Moreover  though the company has been striving to counter this pressure through various initiatives  implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost  Therefore  this is expected to have limited any robust growth in profit margins in the quarter under review Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is currently pinned at  1 4 billion  indicating a projected dip of 0 4  year over year  In addition  Simon Property s activities during the July September quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share witnessed marginal downward revision over the past month and is currently pinned at  3 05  The figure also indicates no change year over year Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model predicts a

106115,327630,AIV,Factors To Impact Mid America Apartment  MAA  Q3 Earnings,opinion,Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc    NYSE MAA     commonly known as MAA   is slated to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 30  after the market closes  The company s results will likely reflect year over year growth in both revenues as well as funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Germantown  TN based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 2 61  in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected growth in same store net operating income  NOI  and rise in average effective rent per unit for the same store portfolio Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and met in the other two  the average positive surprise being 1 99   This is depicted in the chart below Mid America Apartment Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    MAA has provided its guidance for third quarter 2019 FFO per share  projected at  1 51  1 59 Notably  the U S  apartment market has put up an impressive performance in the past few months  successfully banking on the stellar rental unit demand  While occupancy is hovering at a near record level  rents continue to register a steady rise Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  occupancy reached 96 3  as of third quarter 2019  with an impressive leasing activity  The figure is not only up from the prior year period s 95 9   but is also close to the all time high of 96 4  attained almost two decades ago in late 2000  The warmer months witness an uptick in apartment leasing activity  However  this year  the performance was robust  as demand was particularly strong With an uptick in occupancy  rent growth also seems to be steady  For new leases  rents were up 1 2  during the third quarter  driving the annual rent growth pace to 3  and monthly rents averaging  1 416 Particularly  solid job growth across the company s Sunbelt markets has kept demand for MAA s portfolio higher  with the trend likely to have continued in the quarter under review as well  Also  positive demographic trend  supported by growth of prime age groups for rentals and migration of population to the Southeast and Southwest  is expected to have spurred household formation and apartment rental demand in its markets  This is likely to have resulted in higher trends in rent growth in the third quarter Therefore  with a diversified portfolio across the region  both in terms of sub markets and price point  MAA is anticipated to have benefited from the upbeat trends in the September end quarter Also  amid stellar demand for rental units  move outs for the same store portfolio are expected to have remained at a low level in the quarter  Moreover  MAA s redevelopment program that entails interior upgrades is anticipated to have attracted renters  These upgrades provide the residential REIT with higher pricing power  thereby driving top line growth  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter 2019 revenues is pinned at  411 3 million  calling for a year over year improvement of 3 6   Furthermore  MAA s activities during the to be reported quarter were adequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter 2019 FFO per share has been marginally revised upward to  1 55  over the last 60 days  The figure also indicates a year over year increase of 3 3  Nevertheless  the struggle to lure renters might have continued in the July September quarter  as supply volumes were high in a number of the company s markets  Elevated supply curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption  Such an environment is estimated to have resulted in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords  thereby curbing any robust growth momentum of the company Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for MAA this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

106116,327631,AIV,Realty Income  O  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Realty Income Corp    NYSE O   is scheduled to report third quarter 2019 results after market close on Nov 4  The company s results are anticipated to reflect year over year increase in both revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this monthly dividend paying real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise of 1 23  in terms of FFO per share  The company benefited from year over year growth in revenues as well as recorded modest same store rent growth Realty Income has a decent surprise history  Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed estimates on each occasion  the average positive beat being 2 90   This is depicted in the graph below Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Notably  this retail REIT derives more than 90  of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service  non discretionary and low price retail businesses  Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions  as well as competition from Internet retailing  This is expected to have been conducive to its cash flow in the third quarter Moreover  low unemployment  increasing wages and decent consumer sentiment are positive indicators for the retail industry  This is anticipated to have sent positive ripple effects across the industry in the to be reported quarter Furthermore  the company focuses on external growth through exploring accretive acquisition opportunities  Healthy property acquisition volume at decent investment spreads is likely to have driven the company s quarterly performance Notably  during the third quarter  the company announced that it has agreed to acquire 454 single tenant retail properties from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust  Inc  for around  1 25 billion in cash  The deal  expected to take place in a number of tranches with majority of the buyouts taking place this year  will be immediately accretive on a leverage neutral basis  per the company s management Moreover  Realty Income s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently  Since 1996  the company s occupancy level has not moved below 96   This trend is likely to have continued in the quarter under review as well  Further  same store rent growth is expected to display limited operational volatility Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is pegged at  375 8 million  indicating a rise of 11 2  from the year ago reported figure  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter FFO per share is currently pinned at 83 cents  This indicates a 2 5  increase from the year ago quarter Nonetheless  despite all these efforts  the choppy retail real estate environment might limit its growth momentum to some extent as secular industry headwinds  including retailer downsizing and tenant bankruptcies have been dampening the industry fundamentals Moreover  prior to the September end quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the quarter remained unchanged at 83 cents over the past month Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model predicts a positive

106151,327666,AIV,What s In The Cards For Public Storage s  PSA  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Public Storage   NYSE PSA   is slated to release third quarter numbers on Oct 29  after market close  The company s quarterly performance is likely to reflect growth in revenues as well as funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this self storage real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share  Results highlighted higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot that supported the company s same store performance The company has a decent surprise history  It exceeded estimates in three of the preceding four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 0 46   This is depicted in the graph below Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderPublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States  The  Public Storage  brand is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry  with presence in all major metropolitan markets of the United States Notably  favorable demographic changes  healthy job market and rising incomes  migration and downsizing trend  and declining home ownership and the resultant increase in the number of people renting homes are likely to have spurred demand for self storage spaces in the period under consideration  Thus  Public Storage is likely to have benefited from favorable fundamentals in the self storage industry  with its robust scale and high brand value Moreover  since the beginning of 2013 through Jun 30  2019  the company acquired 318 facilities with 22 1 million net rentable square feet from third parties  for approximately  2 9 billion  Additionally  it opened newly developed and expanded self storage space for a total cost of  1 5 billion  adding around 13 9 million net rentable square feet  These acquisition and expansion initiatives are also anticipated to have stoked growth in the third quarter Following Jun 30  2019  the company acquired or was under contract to acquire 10 self storage facilities  spanning 0 8 million net rentable square feet of space  for  86 5 million  Also  as of Jun 30  2019  it had several facilities in development  1 1 million net rentable square feet   with an estimated cost of  189 million  as well as expansion projects  2 7 million net rentable square feet  worth roughly  332 million  Such efforts are likely to have continued in the September end quarter as well  boosting the company s performance As such  revenues are likely to have grown in the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pinned at  732 9 million  depicting nearly 3 8  growth  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter FFO per share is pinned at  2 74  indicating an uptick of 1 5  year over year In addition  Public Storage s activities during the July September period were adequate to gain analyst confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter s FFO per share moved marginally north  over the past two months Nevertheless  Public Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  In addition  in recent years  supply has been increasing in a number of markets  Particularly  deliveries are expected to have been elevated in the to be reported quarter  This is likely to have intensified competition for the company  curbing its power to raise rents and turning on more discounting Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Public Storage this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of a FFO beat  But that s not the case here  You can uncover the

106152,327667,AIV,UDR To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,UDR Inc    NYSE UDR   is slated to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 29  after market close  The company s performance is expected to reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered an in line performance in terms of FFO per share  Results reflected year over year growth in same store net operating income  NOI   Nonetheless  weighted average same store physical occupancy remained flat  year on year In the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions for as many in line performances  delivering an average positive surprise of 1 01  United Dominion Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderThe U S  apartment market has put up an impressive performance in the past few months  successfully banking on the stellar rental unit demand  While occupancy is hovering at a near record level  rents continue to register a steady rise Per the latest  from real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  occupancy reached 96 3  as of third quarter 2019  with an impressive leasing activity  The figure is not only up from the prior year period s 95 9   but is also close to the all time high of 96 4  attained almost two decades ago in late 2000  The warmer months witness an uptick in apartment leasing activity  However  this year  the performance was robust  as demand was particularly strong With an uptick in occupancy  rent growth also seems to be steady  For new leases  rents were up 1 2  during the third quarter  driving the annual rent growth pace to 3  and monthly rents averaging  1 416 Leveraging on this favorable rental housing trend  UDR has been focused on enhancing its overall portfolio by acquiring  developing and redeveloping properties in core operating markets and divesting the company s non core assets Additionally  favorable demographics  household formation and job market gains are anticipated to have been key demand drivers for the company s properties in the third quarter as well  Further  the company has been steadily implementing its Next Generation operating platform consisting of SmartHome installations and other infrastructure buildouts  These efforts will likely have driven margin expansions and supported the company s operational platform during the September end quarter These are likely to have supported its results in the quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is currently pegged at  284 4 million  indicating 6 8  year over year growth However  new supply of apartment properties remained elevated in the quarter under review  in a number of the company s markets  Therefore  we remain apprehensive about UDR s performance as elevated levels of supply limits a landlord s ability to demand more rents  results in lesser absorption and leads to increased concession activity  Also  prior to the third quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overtly optimistic about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the July September quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at 52 cents  over the past 30 days  Nonetheless  it suggests year over year growth of 6 1   The company projects FFO as adjusted per share at 51 53 cents Here is what our

The company s quarterly results are expected to reflect year over year growth in revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share In the last reported quarter  this San Francisco  CA based data

below Digital Realty Trust  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderSolid fundamentals of the data center market are likely to have helped Digital Realty ride on its growth curve in the to be reported quarter  Particularly  with growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  demand for space at properties of data center REITs has been climbing Also  the artificial intelligence  autonomous vehicle and virtual augmented reality markets have been growing at a solid pace  fueling demand for such real estates  In fact  demand is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Amid these  Digital Realty is banking on strategic acquisitions and development efforts for building a premium portfolio of high quality facilities located across North America  Europe  Latin America  Asia and Australia  The company s presence in strategic locations is helping it offer data center  colocation and inter connection solutions for domestic and international tenants efficiently In fact  the full spectrum of data center solutions across a global platform is likely to have helped the company achieve growth in customers  with several having multiple locations across the portfolio  Also  significant customer investment is likely to have ensured stable retention Therefore  such expansion efforts are likely to have driven the company s top and bottom lines in the quarter under consideration  Amid these  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter total revenues is  815 1 million  indicating 6  year over year growth However  competition has intensified  given the solid growth potential in the data center real estate market  This is likely to have led to aggressive pricing pressure in the quarter under review  In addition to this  interest expense burden remains a concern  with the company having a substantial debt position Amid these  Digital Realty s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts  confidence  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at  1 64 in a month s time  However  it indicates

depicted in the graph below Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderThe self storage real estate industry is expected to have remained healthy in the quarter with stable demand  This is likely to have been backed by favorable demographic changes  the downsizing trend and an encouraging labor market  Moreover  increase in the number of people renting homes has escalated the needs of consumers to rent space at a storage facility to park their possessions Amid these  with strategic presence in key cities  Extra Space Storage s efforts to expand its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third party management are anticipated to have been beneficial for its third quarter results Additionally  the self storage sector remains an attractive asset class as it is basically need based and recession resilient in nature  The asset class  low capital expenditure requirements and ability to generate high operating margins is anticipated to have buoyed the company s quarterly results In fact  management and franchise fees for the quarter are estimated to be around  11 87 million  indicating year on year growth of 17 3   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  282 million for property rental revenues suggests an improvement of 5 6  from the prior year quarter s reported figure of  267 million These  in turn  will likely be conducive to the year over year revenue growth by 8 4   with the top line pegged at  332 7 million for the quarter However  Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States  with intense competition from numerous private  regional and local operators  Further  with attractive opportunities in the industry  developers have flocked to this asset class  prompting a surge in development activity  This high supply is likely to have fueled competition for the company during the quarter  curbing its power to

affecting the retail real estate market  for long  which is  in fact  undergoing structural changes  However  with retail spending being still healthy  with consumer spending increasing amid job growth  the retail real estate sector is expected to have grown at a slow yet steady pace With respect to Regency  we note that the company has a considerable experience in the retail real estate

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Adobe  ADBE   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Exelon  EXC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Adobe s shares have gained  14 5  over the past year  underperforming the Zacks Software industry which has increased  22 9  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks Adobe is riding on benefits from Magento and Marketo acquisitions and strong demand for its creative products  It has been making great efforts toward establishing its presence in cloud related software areas such as documents and marketing  
Adobe s market position  compelling product lines  continued innovation  solid adoption of Creative Cloud and Adobe marketing cloud are major positives  Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company s Q2 earnings release  
The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters  However  lower end market demand and exposure to Europe remain overhangs  High acquisition expenses do not bode well for its bottom line 
 You can   
Shares of Buy ranked ConocoPhillips are down  10 8  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks U S  Integrated Oil industry  which has declined  27 3  over the same period  In terms of production and proved reserves  ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and gas exploration and production  E P  player in the world  
The Zacks analyst thinks there are significant opportunities for the upstream energy player in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations  In fact  strong focus on two other prospective resources like Delaware basin and Bakken shale is expected to help ConocoPhillips achieve its target of more than 25  CAGR of production through 2017 to 2019  Increased volumes from the company s unconventional assets primarily backed the company s strong first quarter 2019 results  
Moreover  the upstream energy player is strongly committed toward returning cash to shareholders as is evident from its  3 billion planned buyback program in 2019  ConocoPhillips is also planning to increase its dividend in 2019 after raising the same by 15  in 2018

Exelon s shares have gained  23 1  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Electric Power Industry which has gained  14 9  over the same period  Exelon s first quarter earnings were in line with estimates but revenues surpassed the same  
The Zacks analyst thinks the company continues to benefit from the strategy of investing in advanced technology and infrastructure to expand the regulated business  Exelon s  23 billion planned capital investment for the next four years will be focused on grid modernization and further increasing resilience of its system  
The company continues with its hedging program to manage market risks and protect the value of its generation  Strong cash flow generation capacity will help it lower debt levels and increase value of its shareholders  
However  Exelon is subject to the impact of commodity price volatility and price fluctuation in the wholesale markets  The possibility of increase in prices of Uranium and stringent government regulation are causes of concern

2018 results on Nov 1  after the market closes  Both its funds from operations  FFO  per share and revenues will likely display a decline In the last reported quarter  this Denver  CO based residential real estate investment trust  REIT  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Results displayed growth in same store property net operating income  NOI   and lease up of

landlords The company is making diligent efforts to improve its portfolio mix through property sales  and reinvesting the proceeds in acquisitions of select apartment homes with projected free cash flow internal rates of return greater than expected from the communities being sold  Moreover  it is reinvesting the proceeds in measures like capital enhancements  redevelopments and occasional developments While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  the near term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed  In fact  such short term impact is likely to depress the company s quarterly results  Further  rate hikes are a concern as amid rising rates  financing costs will flare up  As such the company s interest expenses are likely to escalate in the quarter under review The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues is pinned at  241 2 million  indicating a year over year decline of 5 3  Also  there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company s business activities and prospects  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon to be reported quarter remained unchanged at 61 cents  This indicates a 3

apartment market moderated in first quarter 2018  with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down  Nevertheless  the first quarter marked a slow leasing period  thanks to the cold

106274,327789,AIV,Why Hold Strategy Is Apt For Aimco  AIV  Stock Right Now,opinion,Apartment Investment and Management Company   NYSE AIV     better known as Aimco   has been making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions  However  the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term  Also  new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company s rent growth and new lease pricing ability Recently  Aimco reported in line results for first quarter 2018 with respect to pro forma funds from operation  FFO  per share  The results displayed growth in property net operating income  NOI   supported by same store properties  and lease up of redevelopment and acquisition communities  However  these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018 Notably  Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents  superior margins and greater than expected growth  Through these efforts  the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7  to  2 052 in first quarter 2018  Additionally  it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio  In the reported quarter  the percentage of A  B and C  home was 49   35  and 16   respectively Moreover  in April 2018  in sync with its portfolio revamping strategy  Aimco opted for the acquisition of six apartment communities in Philadelphia for  445 million  Further  the company plans to sell its asset management portfolio along with four affordable garden style communities for  590 million  Also  during the first quarter  the company invested  47 million in redevelopment and development  Such efforts are expected to help the company enhance its overall portfolio quality and achieve a favorable mix for long term growth Additionally  due to changing lifestyle  people  on an average  are settling later in life and thereby buying homes later  leading to a rising tendency of living in a rented home  Further  as renting is the only viable option for customers  who cannot avail mortgage loans or are unwilling to buy a house at present  demand for Aimco s premium properties are expected to continue to rise in the coming quarters Also  the company has been on track to enhance its balance sheet and liquidity position  and bring down leverage  Aimco is focusing on boosting its financial flexibility by increasing the pool of unencumbered apartment assets Nonetheless  apartment supply remained elevated in the first quarter  Particularly  new supply is competing with some of the company s higher rent properties  This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords  ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption However  although Aimco s effort to sell non core assets and buy properties in higher growth infill areas is a strategic fit for the long term  the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be avoided in the near term Further  hike in interest rate remain a concern for Aimco  This is because the company s ability to refinance existing debt would be restricted  while the interest cost on new debt would increase  This could adversely affect the company s results and consequently dent its dividend payout Moreover  amid rising rates  not only the financing costs will increase  but the common stock buyers will also demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact

106276,327791,AIV,Residential REITs Stock Outlook  Near Term Pain Inevitable,opinion,"The U S  residential REIT industry s growth in rent is slowing and there is no near term respite in sight Per the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  with several markets experiencing flat rents  U S  apartment rents increased at an annual pace of just 2 3  as of mid 2018  denoting its slowest pace in eight years  While a mid 2018 occupancy level of 95 0  is still healthy  the deceleration in rent growth suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up  and curbing landlords  pricing power Even though solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations of a revival of the U S  residential real estate market fundamentals  the struggle to lure renters will quite obviously continue in the upcoming quarters  when much of new supply is likely to come on course According to the RealPage report  the  annual pace of completions  has climbed above the 300 000 unit level for four consecutive quarters  Further  through mid 2019  annual deliveries will keep adding on to the flow with around 300 000 units  So the stressed environment is anticipated to continue in the near term and curtail residential landlords  ability to command more rents and affect concession levels Moreover  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  is lately experiencing a slowdown in leasing velocity and compression in rent growth amid demand supply imbalances  Specifically  properties away from campus are feeling the brunt Industry Lags in Terms of Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year  it appears that the broader economic recovery wasn t enough for enhancing investors  confidence in the industry s growth prospect  Elevated supply affected the performance of residential REITs over the past several quarters The  Industry  which is a group within the broader   has underperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 3 9   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 12 1  and 4 0   respectively One Year Price PerformanceResidential REIT Stocks Trading CheapFor REITs  price to FFO  funds from operations  multiple is a common measure for valuation  This is because FFO is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales  This is done because although per GAAP accounting norms  REITs are required to depreciate their investment properties over time  in reality many properties experience value appreciation over time

106277,327792,AIV,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Apartment Investment  American Campus And American Homes,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 29  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Residential REITs  including Apartment Investment   Management Co    NYSE AIV    American Campus Communities Inc    NYSE ACC   and American Homes 4 Rent   NYSE AMH   Industry  Residential REITsLink  The U S  residential REIT industry s growth in rent is slowing and there is no near term respite in sight Per the latest  from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage  with several markets experiencing flat rents  U S  apartment rents increased at an annual pace of just 2 3  as of mid 2018  denoting its slowest pace in eight years  While a mid 2018 occupancy level of 95 0  is still healthy  the deceleration in rent growth suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up  and curbing landlords  pricing power Even though solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations of a revival of the U S  residential real estate market fundamentals  the struggle to lure renters will quite obviously continue in the upcoming quarters  when much of new supply is likely to come on course According to the RealPage report  the  annual pace of completions  has climbed above the 300 000 unit level for four consecutive quarters  Further  through mid 2019  annual deliveries will keep adding on to the flow with around 300 000 units  So the stressed environment is anticipated to continue in the near term and curtail residential landlords  ability to command more rents and affect concession levels Moreover  the student housing sector  which is part of the residential REIT industry  is lately experiencing a slowdown in leasing velocity and compression in rent growth amid demand supply imbalances  Specifically  properties away from campus are feeling the brunt Industry Lags in Terms of Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year  it appears that the broader economic recovery wasn t enough for enhancing investors  confidence in the industry s growth prospect  Elevated supply affected the performance of residential REITs over the past several quarters The  Industry  which is a group within the broader   has underperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 3 9   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 12 1  and 4 0   respectively Residential REIT Stocks Trading CheapFor REITs  price to FFO  funds from operations  multiple is a common measure for valuation  This is because FFO is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales  This is done because although per GAAP accounting norms  REITs are required to depreciate their investment properties over time  in reality many properties experience value appreciation over time So  to offset that impact  depreciation and amortization are added back  Moreover  gains on sales of property are subtracted since such sales are considered nonrecurring in nature Thanks to the underperformance of the industry over the past year  the valuation looks really cheap  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P FFO of 18 31  When compared with the highest level of 20 63 and median level of 19 18 over the past year  there is plenty of upside left The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large as the trailing 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 is 20 08 and the median level is 20 17 Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak FFO per Share OutlookSolid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations of still healthy apartment market occupancy despite high deliveries in the near term  Also  shortage in construction labor and rising expenses might somewhat impede the growth momentum of supply But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead  While the earlier valuation discussion shows that there is a solid value oriented path ahead  one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry s FFO per share outlook  FFO per share revisions trend for the constituent companies usually influences their stock market performance The Price   Consensus chart for the industry shows the market s evolving bottom up FFO per share expectations and the industry s aggregate stock market performance  The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus FFO per share expectations for 2019  while the light blue line represents the same for 2018 This becomes even clearer if we focus on the aggregate bottom up FFO per share revisions trend  The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018 Please note that the  2 71 FFO per share estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom up dollar FFO per share estimate for every company in the REIT   Equity Trust   Residential industry  but rather an illustrative aggregate created by our proprietary analytics model  The key factor to keep in mind is not the FFO per share of the industry for 2018  but how this value has evolved recently    As you can see here  the  2 71 FFO per share estimate for 2018 is down from  2 73 at the end of May and  2 75 at the end of the month prior to that and  2 94 this time last year  Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s FFO per share potential Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued underperformance in the near term The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Residential industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  183  which places it at the bottom 28  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Revenue Trend of Residential REITs Shows Some PromiseWhile the near term prospects look unwelcoming for investors  the uptrend in revenues over the past years appears promising  This might support long term growth in FFO per share  Bottom LineFinally  in the present demand supply scenario  a deceleration of fundamentals is anticipated  Therefore  pressure on new lease rates  occupancy as well as retention would persist  while concession activity to lure renters is expected to remain high Moreover  for REITs  rate hike remains the biggest near term challenge as the use of leverage for REIT business makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest rate movements  Also  the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts  Although  the short term nature of lease for residential REITs usually helps in adjusting rents quickly to any rate hike  the current lower pricing power is likely to erode some of that benefit Now it s time for investors to consider portfolio reshuffling and stay away from some stocks from the said industry  which are unlikely to bounce back in the near term  Among these are  You can see   Apartment Investment   Management Co   The stock of this Denver  CO based residential REIT  which is better known as Aimco  has lost 4 2  of its value over the past six months  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year FFO per share has been revised 1 6  downward over the last 60 days American Campus Communities Inc   The consensus FFO per share estimate for this Austin  TX based student housing REIT has moved

106311,327826,AIV,What s In The Cards For Aimco  AIV  This Earnings Season ,opinion,Apartment Investment   Management Co    NYSE AIV     commonly known as Aimco   is slated to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Feb 2  after the market closes  Revenues and funds from operations  FFO  per share are expected to grow year over year Last quarter  FFO of this residential real estate investment trust  REIT  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results displayed growth in property net operating income  NOI  supported by same store properties  and lease up of redevelopment and acquisition communities  The company also benefited from reduced overhead costs  However  this positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016 Nevertheless  Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history  Over the trailing four quarters  the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and reported in line numbers in the other two quarters  Overall  the stock witnessed an average positive surprise of 0 82   This is depicted in the chart below Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise   Shares of Aimco have underperformed the   While the company s shares have lost 9   the industry has witnessed a decline of 8 7  over the last six months Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsPer a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm   RealPage   NASDAQ RP     the U S  apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter  While U S  apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2 5  in 2017  effective rents for new leases edged down 0 9  during the quarter  Admittedly  the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years  However  national apartment occupancy came in at 95 1  at the end of the fourth quarter  remaining stable year over year Furthermore  Aimco has a diversified portfolio both in terms of geography and price point  This is likely to aid the company to meet the increase in demand for apartment properties from echo boomers   children of the baby boomer generation   in the to be reported quarter Also  Aimco has been making concerted efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents  superior margins and higher than expected growth While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  the near term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed  In fact  such short term impact is likely to drag the company s quarterly results Further  there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company s markets  This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to be reported quarter Prior to the fourth quarter earnings release  there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company s business activities and prospects  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon to be reported quarter remained unchanged at 63 cents  over the past month  Nevertheless  this indicates a 5  increase year over year  For the fourth quarter  management projects pro forma FFO per share in the band of 60 64 cents The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  249 8 million  indicating a year over year improvement of 0 12  For full year 2017  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  988 7 million  The consensus estimate for FFO per is  2 45  reflecting a year over year increase of 5 6   Further  management expects FFO per share in the range of  2 42  2 46 Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aimco will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below You can uncover the best
