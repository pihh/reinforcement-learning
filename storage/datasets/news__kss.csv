143374,364889,KSS,An Amazon Acquisition of Kohl s Looks Like a Great Idea Again     for Kohl s,news,"If the idea rings a bell  it may be because the prospect of e commerce behemoth Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  acquiring brick and mortar outfit Kohl s  NYSE KSS  first surfaced in 2017  Neither name floated the premise then  but plenty of other people did  Amazon had just purchased Whole Foods  and was experimenting with a small number of physical bookstores  A bigger retailing deal seemed to be a fairly natural progression  particularly given how Amazon was starting to dabble in private label goods  But  nothing ever came of it 
Perhaps now it will  Following Kohl s disappointing holiday sales report posted last week against the backdrop of the ongoing retail apocalypse  doing nothing doesn t feel right  It may not be the path the retailer wanted to take  but it may be the best one available to Kohl s from here 
Nothing else seems to be working
During the months of November and December when holiday related spending was most frenzied  Kohl s saw same store sales sink 0 2  versus expectations for a 0 4  improvement  Those tepid numbers prompted the retailer to dial back its full year profit forecast to a range of between  4 75 to  4 95 per share  down from expectations between  5 15 and  5 45 per share 

It s difficult to conclude Kohl s woes are entirely self inflicted  Rival apparel oriented department stores like Macy s  NYSE M  and JC Penney  NYSE JCP  also logged holiday related sales declines  falling victim to the rise of myriad ways to procure consumer products online 
Of all the brick and mortar names that were supposed to see growth during the busy holiday shopping season  though  it was Kohl s  Early last year it expanded the program that turns its physical stores into return centers for Amazon com  leading CEO Michelle Gass to tout the program and its potential during the company s third quarter conference call in November  More foot traffic spurred by Amazon s customers doesn t appear to have added sales  however  Perhaps the matter is beyond Kohl s control 
If that is indeed the case    and the argument is a strong one    Gass may want to start entertaining bolder options  The boldest and seemingly most exciting one is completely teaming up with Amazon com 
Making the most out of private label
The proverbial win win here is obvious  but likely underestimated by most investors 
Yes  Amazon would instantaneously own the physical footprint that it seems to want  Assuming its current market capitalization represents its value to a suitor  Amazon would have access to more than 1100 sizable retail locales for an affordable  7 billion  it spent  13 7 billion to own fewer than 500 Whole Foods stores  and groceries are a remarkably low margin business  Kohl s would enjoy a much stronger marketing effort too  with its parent able to direct more than 100 million U S  customers toward the stores 
Such a pairing  however  would have much more meaningful strategic implications  A deeper relationship would be a means of giving Kohl s access to more exclusive brands that are now only part of Amazon s private label operation  and Kohl s would be a better distribution channel for those goods 
Amazon s foray into home grown merchandise has led to the development of a few hundred brands  and it would be naive to suggest they ve not rattled a few mid sized rivals  But  its 100  private label apparel names still only collectively account for about 1  of the company s own product lines  according to numbers from JungleScout  Most of the major apparel labels aren t sweating yet 
The struggle of Amazon s private label clothing effort at least partially points to the difficulty of shopping for apparel online  The garment can t be touched or tried on  preventing some consumers from making an online apparel purchase in the first place  More options to return ill fitting clothing helps ease that friction  but it s still not enough  Access to that apparel in a physical store could only help sell more of those brands 
Access to physical selling space would also be a boost to Amazon s electronics business  and increasingly  its private label home goods business  Kohl s sells a fair amount of blenders  bedding  and small furniture  but Amazon has moved into the same space with its Stone   Beam brand of furniture  and AmazonBasics sheets  breadmakers  and cookware  Again though  that s often a hands on purchasing process 
Bottom line
Admittedly  the idea is easier said than done  Private label goods sold in stores still have to be handled with care  as they compete with national  third party brands  and those outside vendors have plenty of experience not just with designing clothing and other hard line goods like kitchenware and luggage  but also with promoting those goods to pull them through distribution channels like Kohl s  About half of Kohl s top line is already driven by private label sales  and it s clearly not doing particularly well with its home grown inventory  Yet  Amazon has little direct experience on this front 
A remix of its private label offerings and a good marketing jolt  however  could be a much needed shakeup  Not only might that drive the average age of Kohl s customers from 50 to Amazon s average closer to 37  such a shift might inspire more frequent visits    and purchases    from Amazon s usually active customer base 
It certainly couldn t hurt in that regard     that is  if Amazon is interested in taking on another project ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pif-0,2060276

143377,364892,KSS,The 3 Ways Kohl s Can Still Save Itself,news,"Kohl s  NYSE KSS  has shed roughly a third of its market value over the past 12 months  as its comparable store sales withered and its gross margin contracted  Like many other struggling brick and mortar retailers  Kohl s is desperately using markdowns to stay afloat 
That strategy flopped throughout fiscal 2019  Kohl s comps declined in the first half of the year  then stayed nearly flat in the third quarter  It recently revealed that its sales fell 0 2  annually in November and December  and revised its full year earnings guidance toward the  low end  of its prior forecast for a decline of 12  to 15  
In short  none of the turnaround strategies Kohl s implemented over the past year    including its partnership with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and an apparel deal with the Olsen Twins    brought back shoppers  Kohl s didn t offer any guidance for fiscal 2020  which starts in February  but analysts expect its revenue to rise less than 1  and for its earnings to dip another 4  
Those estimates suggest that Kohl s will continue sacrificing its margins to generate anemic comps growth  but it s not down for the count yet  Let s take a look at three ways Kohl s can still save itself as the retail apocalypse rages on 

1  Renegotiate its deal with Amazon
Kohl s expanded its partnership with Amazon to all of its stores last year  which allowed Kohl s to accept product returns purchased through Amazon and sell Amazon products at its stores  Customers could simply drop a product off at a Kohl s counter without a box  and Kohl s will repackage and ship it back to Amazon without charging the customer 
Kohl s hoped that those customers would also buy a few products at Kohl s  which would partly offset the processing costs for Amazon s returns  Unfortunately  Kohl s weak holiday sales indicated that Amazon customers simply dropped off their products and left  Meanwhile  Amazon recently reported  record breaking  sales during its holiday season 
This partnership clearly benefits Amazon more than it does Kohl s  If Kohl s wants to salvage this deal  it should press for more benefits  It can push Amazon to subsidize its packaging and shipping expenses  promote a dedicated online store for Kohl s on Amazon com  or allow Amazon gift cards to be used at Kohl s stores  Any of those solutions would be preferable to blindly accepting returns for Amazon 

2  Launch an off price banner
Kohl s is struggling with competition from Amazon  superstores like Walmart and Target  fast fashion retailers like Zara  and off price challengers like The TJX Companies  NYSE TJX   Kohl s can t match the scale of Amazon or Walmart  but it can consider challenging TJX with its own off price banner 
TJX  the parent company of T J  Maxx  Marshalls  HomeGoods  HomeSense  and Sierra Trading Post  consistently outperforms full price brick and mortar retailers by buying products at liquidation prices and selling them at lower prices than Amazon  That s why it expects to post its 24th straight year of comps growth this year 
Kohl s rival Macy s  NYSE M  already pursued this strategy with its Backstage banner  Last quarter  CFO Paula Price noted that Macy s had opened 50 new Backstage stores throughout the year  and that the locations that had been open for over a year  continued to perform well  up mid single digits  and have improved both margin and turn  
If Kohl s converts some of its stores to an off price format and liquidates its excess inventories through them  it could boost its sales growth again  That strategy would weigh down its gross margins  but it could widen its moat against its rivals and generate more sustainable revenue growth in the future 
3  Secure more real estate partners
Kohl s is shrinking its stores and renting out the remaining space to partners like Planet Fitness gyms and Aldi grocery stores  Once again  the idea is that customers visiting those businesses will pick up some products at Kohl s  That s a promising start  but Kohl s should secure more real estate partners to bring back shoppers 
To offset its ongoing weakness in women s apparel  it can secure partnerships with hotter brands like American Eagle Outfitters  Aerie or lululemon athletica    which are both looking to expand their brick and mortar presence beyond malls with stand alone stores  It could also secure partnerships with fast food chains like Chick fil A or Starbucks to convert diners into shoppers  These moves could generate more sustainable growth than its one sided deal with Amazon 
The key takeaway
Kohl s 5 7  forward dividend yield and its forward P E of 10 make it look like an undervalued dividend stock  But Kohl s stock is cheap for obvious reasons  and the company is clearly losing ground against the competition  Kohl s isn t out of options yet  but it should consider renegotiating its deal with Amazon  launching off price stores  and gaining more real estate partners to bring back shoppers ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plby5,2064839

143399,364914,KSS,Kohl s Amazon Partnership Is Looking Like a Bust,news,"In 2017  Kohl s  NYSE KSS  made a surprising move  
The mid market department store chain said it would accept Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  returns at a handful of its stores  At the time  it seemed like an odd move  as Kohl s essentially looked like it was doing Amazon a favor by processing and packaging customers  returns  Kohl s also allowed Amazon to set up in shop in stores  selling products like Echo devices   
After testing the Amazon returns program at 82 stores for nearly two years  Kohl s expanded it nationwide in 2019  apparently pleased with the results  At the time  CEO Michelle Gass said   This new service is another example of how Kohl s is delivering innovation to drive traffic to our stores and bring more relevance to our customers  

Kohl s doesn t appear to be taking any direct payment from Amazon to handle its returns  if it does  it hasn t said so   and it s consistently argued that the partnership would improve foot traffic  The additional traffic is clearly the biggest  and maybe only  benefit Kohl s is getting from the deal 
Investors have generally applauded the partnership  Shares jumped 12  last April  hitting what s now its 52 week high  when the retailer said it would roll the returns program out nationwide over the summer  However  after being in effect for the full third quarter and the holiday season  the collaboration seems to be doing little to help Kohl s results 
So far  not so good
Kohl s stock fell as much as 10  following disappointing holiday sales results for the November and December period  Comparable sales slipped 0 2  year over year  and the company said earnings per share would come in at the low end of its prior range of  4 75 to  4 95  That EPS forecast was down substantially from the  5 80 to  6 15 management called for at the beginning of the fiscal year  
This came as an especially unpleasant surprise  because management had spent so much time talking up the Amazon partnership  Here are a few quotes from CEO Michelle Gass on the third quarter earnings call in November 

 We continue to be very pleased with  The Amazon returns program s  overall performance  and based on the results we are seeing  we remain confident that it will have a positive contribution to operating income in 2019  
 We are very much looking forward to the holiday season  which will be the first with Amazon returns in stores nationwide  
 We will have Amazon returns in stores nationwide this holiday for the first time  which will drive additional traffic into our stores  

Despite that optimism  comparable sales in November and December actually declined  which the company blamed on poor performance in women s apparel  It s unclear if management was happy with the Amazon returns program during the period  but even if it did help lift traffic  it didn t do enough to offset challenges in other areas  It also seems unlikely that the program boosted operating income  given the cut in earnings guidance  
A pound of flesh
Kohl s may be drawing some benefits from the Amazon arrangement  but the costs seem to outweigh any advantage it s gaining from the additional traffic  Gass acknowledged that the returns program added to operating costs in the third quarter  but the bigger issue is that Kohl s appears to be giving too much away here for the sake of incremental traffic  much of which may not even consist of actual customers 
Other businesses have similar partnerships with Amazon  but they aren t as lopsided as Kohl s  UPS Stores  for example  accept Amazon returns the same way  but its core business is transporting packages so it directly benefits from doing the work to repackage Amazon returns  Rite Aid  the struggling pharmacy chain  has Amazon Lockers in some of its stores and started offering over the counter package pickup last year  but that is still much less labor intensive than processing returns     
Kohl s even took the bizarre step of designating parking spots for Amazon returns near the entrances of the first 82 stores eligible for the program  essentially rewarding its rival s customers instead of its own  Of those making returns at Kohl s  many aren t going to buy anything in store  If they re not buying anything from Kohl s  then they re just taking up parking and employee resources that could be used for actual customers and adding to the lines at stores during the busy holiday season    
The Amazon returns program was clearly a major initiative for Kohl s and one that took many hours of planning  negotiating  implementation  and training  Gass has called the program innovative  and management is clearly excited about its traffic driving potential  but if your best idea for bringing people into your stores is processing competitor returns  you may just be out of ideas  
I was skeptical of the Kohl s Amazon partnership when it was first announced in 2017  The early results have only hardened my doubts  Management s commentary in March when it reports full fourth quarter earnings should add some key details  but for now  there s only one winner in this arrangement  and it s not the department store chain ",2020-01-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgtfw,2057431
143402,364917,KSS,Kohl s CEO Michelle Gass   Amazon is working ,news,Kohl s CEO Michelle Gass said the retailer s partnership with Amazon  is working  That s after Kohl s reported disappointing holiday sales  which led analysts to doubt that the tie up with Amazon was paying off ,2020-01-13,CNBC,https://invst.ly/phf6k,2058122
143403,364918,KSS,Kohl s Partnership With Amazon Really Isn t Working After All,news,"Despite analysts expecting only tepid sales growth for Kohl s  NYSE KSS  for the Christmas season  the retailer wasn t even able to make it over that low hurdle  comparable store sales fell for the November to December holiday shopping period 
Although CEO Michele Gass assured investors the department store s vaunted partnership with Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  would drive sales higher as it was rolled out nationally last year  a disastrous third quarter earnings report and now a disappointing Christmas update makes it clear the program is not working 
While there is some evidence customers are using the department store chain as a drop off point to return their Amazon packages  Kohl s really just has one more chance to show the partnership can generate sales before investors conclude the program is a failure 

The mall is a ghost town
The retail apocalypse is having a devastating impact on mall based retailers    J C  Penney  NYSE JCP  and Macy s  NYSE M  also reported falling comps  though the former s were much worse than the latter s  and analysts see Macy s as having a chance to make a U turn 
Kohl s comps were actually the best of the trio  but it being the retailer least attached to the shopping mall could explain why its same store sales were down only 0 2  compared to a 0 6  drop at Macy s and the severe 7 5  plunge at J C  Penney  Still  analysts had only set the bar for Kohl s at a 0 4  increase  so the decline is substantial  It also forced the retailer to forecast that full year earnings would come in near the low end of its previously issued guidance of  4 75 to  4 95 per share 
Management blamed the shortfall on weakness in its women s apparel department  even though it had a  solid performance  in footwear and men s  but with women s accounting for nearly 30  of total annual sales  any lapse will be magnified 
Many happy returns
Yet it was this sort of deficiency that Amazon was supposed to help alleviate  Customers who buy something on Amazon and want to return it initiate the return on Amazon s website and are given a range of options on how they want to return the item  One of them is to drop it off at a Kohl s store  with the customer not needing to box it up or even have the original packaging  They just bring the item in  and the retailer processes the return free of charge 
Gass was amped about the partnership s potential  telling investors last quarter that with the returns program operating in all stores for the holidays  Kohl s was setting up special merchandising areas around the returns counter to capture new customers  She was certain it would  drive additional traffic into our stores  
While geolocation surveys suggest more customers have come to Kohl s stores following the program s rollout  the sales results make it obvious they ve purchased very little if anything 
A Hail Mary pass
Kohl s has one more shot at proving this program can work  UPS calls Jan  2 National Returns Day and said it expected 1 6 million transactions to be conducted that day  a 26  increase from last year 
At the same time  Amazon said this was its most successful Christmas ever  with tens of billions of products sold worldwide and the number of items shipped via Prime one day or same day delivery quadrupling over last year  It s a good bet a large number of those items will be returned  If Kohl s has any chance of showing the partnership can work  it needs consumers to make many of those returns through its stores and then buy something while they re there 
It always seemed dubious that someone buying on Amazon com would decide to now shop at Kohl s  Unfortunately  the lack of sales during the holidays suggests those fears were well founded  If the retailer can t generate more sales this month when there should be a large influx of people returning packages  there seems to be little hope it will ever amount to anything  and Kohl s is facing a much more difficult future ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phvu9,2059016

143405,364920,KSS,Market Seems To Retain Some Trade Related Optimism Heading Into Holiday,opinion,"During this holiday shortened week  we d like to wish everyone a safe and happy Thanksgiving 
 Wednesday Market Open  It s the day before Thanksgiving  so unlike many of us after stuffing ourselves on turkey and dressing  trading today could be thin  By noon the most exciting thing among market participants might be the race to the airport 
Light volumes can exacerbate moves in either direction  but for now Wall Street seems to be relatively sedate  with the tone generally positive on lingering optimism that helped stocks close at record highs to end yesterday s session  Regardless of how quiet the market might be today  a finish of even a smidge higher in the main three U S  indices would mean fresh closing records
President Trump said the world s two largest economies were getting close to a deal  And the Chinese Commerce Ministry said negotiators from both sides had agreed to discussions about a partial trade deal 
Still  without a deal officially inked  investors and traders may want to use caution in following the trade related headlines  since the news flow has had plenty of ups and downs as the trade war has dragged on 
In trade related corporate news  Deere  NYSE DE  shares were getting taken out to the woodshed this morning despite the heavy equipment maker reporting profit that slightly beat expectations and revenue that exceeded forecasts  Shares were down more than 4  in premarket trading after the company lowered guidance and said its agricultural equipment sales could drop 5  10  in fiscal year 2020 
The company s CEO cited trade tensions and difficult growing and harvesting conditions in causing many farmers to be cautious about buying new equipment 
For now though  the market seems optimistic  which seems to be helping lift stocks as well as oil prices  It seems that sentiment is positive among oil investors and traders who could be thinking that companies will ship more goods and increase the demand for black gold if a trade deal does get signed 
Retailers Help Boost Market TuesdayTraders and investors went on a shopping spree Tuesday  pushing the three main U S  indices to another round of record closes 
Retailers were in focus as earnings season continued   Best Buy   NYSE BBY  encouraged investors by beating analysts  consensus earnings and revenue estimates and raising its guidance as the company has kept itself relevant and its stores updated  It s shares rose more than 9 8   Dicks Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS  did even better  rising more than 18 6  after easily topping estimates and raising guidance 
On the other end of the spectrum  Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  fell more than 15   after the company came up short of analysts  earnings expectations 

DLTR joined   Home Depot    NYSE HD  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  in disappointing investors  but overall  it s been a pretty good earnings season for retailers  and recent retail sales figures have been slightly better than expected  The growth in discretionary spending  especially after the prior month s contraction  seems to be a welcome sign ahead of the holiday shopping season  which many retailers rely upon for a good chunk of their revenue 
While Black Friday this year could be a litmus test for whether the U S  consumer is as strong as we ve been thinking  the shopping event is arguably waning in importance 
Decent weather around the nation heading into Thanksgiving may have had people shopping earlier this year  as perhaps have early deals from some companies  Couple those factors with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  regularly offering products at discounted rates and the increased importance of Cyber Monday sales and Black Friday s impact this year may not be as high as in past years 
It also appears that an optimistic view of the economy from Powell on Monday also helped market sentiment yesterday  The Fed s accommodative stance on monetary policy has been one of the factors helping stocks to their current record levels  




CHART OF THE DAY  RISK RECKONED RECEDING  With stocks notching fresh records as investors apparently were in risk on mode  it s probably not too much of a surprise that Wall Street s main fear gauge  the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  eased on Tuesday  The VIX often moves lower when investors are feeling optimistic about the market and are more willing to buy perceived riskier assets like equities  Note that 2019 has seen a few spikes above 20  purple line  followed by periods of grinding lower  Data source  Cboe Global Markets  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
A Roof Over Your Fed  Although consumer confidence numbers from the Conference Board have been retreating  from a global perspective the U S  consumer is one of the brighter spots in the world economy at the moment  That seems to bode well  not only for the upcoming holiday shopping season  but also for the housing market  as buying a home is one of the biggest discretionary purchases a person can make  According to the Federal Reserve  easier monetary policy this year is already helping the housing market   The full effects of these monetary policy actions will be felt over time  but we believe they are already helping to support consumer and business sentiment and boosting spending in interest sensitive sectors  such as housing and consumer durable goods   Powell said in a speech Monday 
Housing Data Better Than Forecast  Housing data on Tuesday seemed to bear that out  New home sales for October came in stronger than expected at 733 000 units  compared with 710 000 forecast in a Briefing com consensus  While the new figure did represent an unexpected decline from the previous month  that was largely because September s figure was revised substantially higher  from 701 000 initially reported to 738 000  marking the highest level since July 2007   The key takeaway from the report is that the October showing was better than what meets the eye at first blush given the large upward revision to the prior month s number   Briefing com said 
Tight Jobs Market Helps Housing  While lower mortgage rates are helping spur home buying  they re not the only factor  In addition to  ebullient market sentiment   a strong jobs market is also contributing to homebuyer demand  according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac  That makes sense because when people feel secure about their employment they might feel better about making a big purchase like a house  Also  tight labor markets can lead to higher wages as companies try to attract employees  More money in people s bank accounts can lead to feeling more secure when buying a home  Data from Freddie Mac showed the U S  weekly average for a 30 year fixed mortgage at 3 66  as of Nov  21  substantially lower than the 4 81  from a year prior   Residential real estate accounts for one sixth of the economy  and the improving real estate market will support economic growth heading into next year   Freddie Mac said

143407,364922,KSS,Holiday Retail Sales Could Be Losing Their Spirit,opinion,"November retail sales only rose 0 2  from October  falling sizably short of the 0 5  estimations  With unemployment at a half century low  what is holding consumers back  Have US shoppers lost their holiday cheer or is something else to blame 
Thanksgiving came on the 28th this year  the latest it could be in November  This left only 2 days for holiday shopping last month with the holiday shopping season ostensibly starting the day after thanksgiving 
The  retail apocalypse  also played its role in November s softer than expected retail figures  Black Friday s Doorbusters are losing their allure to Cyber Monday  Roughly 40  of holiday shoppers said they would be doing their holiday shopping online 
Waiting for Cyber Monday reduces the stress of Black Friday shopping  It is the preferred method for most Millennials and Gen Z s unless you are a deal junkie that loves the Black Friday rush  Cyber Monday occurring in December didn t help last month s figures 
Online shopping was up 11 5  from last November with broader retail up only 2 5   Companies like Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   and Alibaba   NYSE BABA   are reaping the benefits of the shifting consumer 
Department stores that rely heavily on holiday shopping for a large portion of their sales are taking a hit  Stocks like Macy s   NYSE M   and Kohl s   NYSE KSS   continue to get beat up into the holiday season 
Consumer spending may also be a culprit  Consumers may be holding back on hefty holiday spending as they see a foggy economic future ahead ",2019-12-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/holiday-retail-sales-could-be-losing-their-spirit-200492585,200492585

Shares of Kohl s  NYSE KSS  were sliding today after the department store chain turned in an underwhelming holiday sales report and tamped down full year profit expectations  As a result  the stock was down 8 9  as of 12 17 p m  EST 
So what
Comparable sales at the retailer dipped 0 2  in November and December  compared to expectations of 0 4  growth for the full fourth quarter  which includes January  Though Kohl s outperformed department store peers like Macy s and J C  Penney  the numbers were disappointing  especially since the company had expanded its Amazon returns program to stores nationwide this summer  which was expected to lift traffic during the key holiday season 

Kohl s also said that adjusted earnings per share would come in at the low end of its previous range of  4 75 to  4 95  CEO Michelle Gass noted challenges in women s apparel in the period  saying   We continue to see momentum in key areas including our digital business  active  beauty and children s  and solid performance in footwear and men s  This was offset by softness in women s  which we are working with speed to address  
Now what
Fiscal 2019 has been a year of disappointments for Kohl s  the stock is down 35  over the last year  and full year EPS is now expected to decline 15  from a year ago  Its forecast of  4 75 in adjusted EPS is considerably worse than its initial guidance of  5 80 to  6 15  made last March  That s a sign of poor execution and unexpected challenges during the year

Stocks soar to record close as investor focus shifts back to trade

U S  stock indexes on Thursday hit new records as investors turn to fresh progress on a partial China trade pact  amid apparent easing of Middle East tensions ",2020-01-09,MarketWatch,https://invst.ly/pg1oi,2056341
143431,364946,KSS,Asia Morning  China Cranks Up Stimulus Engine  Trade Worries Spook Markets,opinion,"Fresh from cutting the 7 day repo rate on Monday  China has shaved 5bps of its 1 year and 5 year Loan Prime Rates this morning to 4 15  and 4 80  respectively  It seems clear that China isn t waiting around for an interim trade deal to be signed and is cranking up the revolutions on the stimulus engine sooner rather than later as its economy slows 
Overnight  the U S  Commerce Secretary commented that he was still optimistic that they could get  something done  with China but that a deal was still  a work in progress   The comments have left me with more of a putting a brave face on things feeling  as opposed to the much more upbeat rhetoric we have heard from Washington DC in the past few weeks 
The timetable for rolling back tariffs is clearly a sticking point for both sides  with frankly  a complete lack of detail thus far on the nuts and bolts of the interim agreement  That ties with the rather sanguine comments on trade progress from the China Ministry of Commerce over the weekend 
Things have got somewhat more complicated this morning after the U S  Senate unanimously passed a bill backing the Hong Kong protestors  The U S  House of Representatives has also passed their version of the law  Assuming the Senate and House can combine their bills  it would mean that any veto from President Trump would be nullified  China has  unsurprisingly  condemned the Senate s actions this morning as blatant interference with China and Hong Kong s internal affairs 
With China now clearly on an easing path regardless of any agreement  and as the U S  Congress throws their own political curveballs  markets should rightly be nervous about the state of trade negotiations  Wall Street stubbornly clung to its gains overnight  but other markets appear to be jumping ship with oil under the pump  and gold inching higher 
With the trade talks remaining the only macro economic game in town  a U S  December 15th tariff deadline rapidly approaching  an angry China and a U S  President neck deep in an impeachment battle  the risks of a material correction lower on the global recovery trade continue to ratchet higher 
The data calendar globally is strictly tier 2 over the next 24 hours  meaning that markets will be more susceptible than ever to the nuances of trade sentiment  for good or for ill 
Equities
Wall Street had a mixed day with weak earnings from Home Depot  NYSE HD  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  sapping sentiment  That said  Wall Street is nothing if not stubborn  and refused to buckle under the pressure  The S P 500 fell 0 06   the NASDAQ rose 0 24   and the Dow Jones fell 0 37  
U S  Treasury yields probably assisted stocks  continuing to ease  with the 10 year dipping under 1 80  
Wall Street closed before the U S  Senate announced the passing of the Hong Kong Bill  leaving Asia to digest its immediate consequences  That reaction does not look positive with the Nikkei 225 falling 0 53   the KOSPI falling 0 98   the Straits Times off 043  and the ASX flat  Hong Kong and China  having mysteriously defied the rest of Asia s caution this week  look to be finally coming into line 
Shanghai is lower by 0 30   the CSI 300 has fallen 0 40   and the Hang Seng is off 0 90  China s strong rebuttal of the U S  Senate s actions will likely keep Asian stock markets under pressure today  particularly Hong Kong  as worries increase that a belligerent China may lose interest in an interim trade deal 
CurrenciesUSD CNH has risen by 0 10  to 7 0330 this morning on China nerves  USD CNH has technical resistance at 7 0350  and a daily close above this level opens further rallies  although it will remain at the mercy of intra day trade sentiment 
The trade sensitive AUD and NZD are both lower by 0 20  to 0 6815 and 0 6415  respectively  Regional Asian currencies have mostly eased slightly against the greenback in early trading  spooked by worries over the trade negotiations 
GBP USD once again attempted to rally towards the 1 3000 regions and once again failed in its efforts overnight  Sterling finished the session 0 25  lower at 1 2925  The 1 3000 technical resistance looks more robust by the day  implying we will need more clarity on the UK election result if sterling is to challenge it seriously  On the downside  1 2900 technical support looks in danger with GBP easing to 1 2910 this morning  A break of 1 2900 implies a deeper correction and a clearout of Brexit longs 
Oil
Oil was unceremoniously crushed overnight with Reuters reporting that OPEC  are unlikely to deepen production cuts at their December meeting  Brent crude fell 2 45  to  60 70 a barrel  and WTI fell 2 95  to  55 20 a barrel  Oil was caught in a perfect storm last night  as a still very long speculative market was caught out by OPEC  and trade nervousness  plus a massive U S  API Crude Inventory increase of 5 954 million barrels 
Both contracts are now sitting at the bottom of their 6 week technical up trends  In WTI s case  support is very near at  55 00 a barrel  A break of this level or  60 00 on Brent signals the downside correction could have a lot further to run 
Oil markets will be nervously watching the official U S  Crude Inventory data this evening with an increase of 1 06 million barrels expected  A number that substantially exceeds that could be the straw that breaks the camels back 
GoldGold rose 0 10  to  1472 00 overnight  having held an initial pullback to  1465 00 an ounce  Gold is benefitting from a move into haven positioning on trade nerves  as well as U S  Treasury yields continuing to track lower 
Technical resistance at  1475 00 and  1480 00 is nearby though and will be a formidable region to overcome  A daily close above the latter implies a rally to  1520 00 an ounce is possible  as short term bearish positioning is squeezed out  That is a large  if  though with more momentum for gold likely to be required  Either in the shape of a deterioration of trade hopes or a material equity market correction lower  or both ",2019-11-20,Jeffrey Halley,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asia-morning-china-cranks-up-stimulus-engine-trade-worries-spook-markets-200486533,200486533
143432,364947,KSS,Kohl s Drops On Earnings  Further Downside Ahead,opinion,"Summary  Kohls  NYSE KSS  sank 19  on Tuesday after the company posted earnings that missed Wall Street expectations  
We believe the stock has more downside risk in the coming months  based on its market cycles 






The company reported earnings per share of  0 74 and total revenue of  4 36 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  0 86 and  4 39 billion  Looking forward  management cut its guidance to  4 75 4 95  below the  5 19 consensus  
CEO Michelle Gass put a positive spin on the quarter   We are pleased to report that our business recaptured momentum during the third quarter  returning to growth with a comparable sales increase of 0 4    But that didn t stop investors from bidding the stock lower 
Our approach to stock analysis uses market cycles to project price action  KSS failed perfectly from resistance and is now in the declining phase of its current cycle  with a few weeks remaining  Our target is  45  We expect next year to be a bit rough

143452,364967,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Lags Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Kohl s  KSS  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 74 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 98 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  12 94   A quarter ago  it was expected that this department store operator would post earnings of  1 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of 1 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Kohl s  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry  posted revenues of  4 63 billion for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 92   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 63 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Kohl s shares have lost about 12  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 24 5  
What s Next for Kohl s 
While Kohl s has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kohl s was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 23 on  6 93 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 23 on  19 83 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

143473,364988,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  To Report Q3 Results  Will The Retailer Continue Declining  ,opinion,"Kohl s   NYSE KSS   will report its third quarter results before the market opens on Tuesday  November 19  The retailer has seen its shares decline over 13  in 2019 but has outperformed the broader regional department store market s over 27  fall 
Many retailers that have been slow to adapt to the contemporary market have ended up in bankruptcy  as they become displaced by the new era of shopping  Kohl s is a major department store retailer that has been trying to refresh its brand as the retail market scrambles to better compete with the digital marketplace 
Kohl s Looks to Drive Traffic 
With more consumers ditching malls and department stores for more convenient online shopping on Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Kohl s is left with the daunting task of reinventing itself and providing attractions than can pry consumers away from the digital marketplace  Kohl s famously undertook the  if you can t beat them  join them  mantra when it partnered with Amazon to serve as a return location for packages bought on the e commerce giant s website 
Kohl s formed the relationship with Amazon to drive foot traffic in its stores with a handful of Kohl s stores  The performance the company saw in the trial run prompted a nationwide rollout in all of its 1 150 stores  Both geolocation foot traffic analysis and anonymized credit card data showed a big uptick in consumers visiting Kohl s stores following the implementation of the program 
Kohl s CEO  Michelle Gass  spoke on how mutually beneficial the partnership was  saying  This Amazon partnership  really does take advantage of the assets of the company  We gain the traffic  Amazon creates a great customer experience   The success with Kohl s partnership also led to Amazon partnering with additional retailers for package pick up and return sites 
The world s largest retailer  Walmart   NYSE WMT    also saw the potential in its vast warehouse footprint  The company implemented its buy online  pickup in store feature  which has become a pillar of Walmart s online presence  It provides consumers the same satisfaction of online shopping while offering free shipping without an annual membership  the service also gets more people in its stores  If Kohl s can see similar success with the utilization of its warehouse space  then it would be a much needed boost 
Moving Forward
No one knows quite yet the exact number of people stopping to shop in Kohl s after returning their Amazon purchase  In addition  helping Amazon with its customer service is risky as it might just steer consumers even more towards the very company that is causing the decline in the retail sector  
Not knowing the exact benefit Kohl s is receiving from the partnership while its comp sales and net sales continue to fall may not be a formula for success  However  same store sales that had been negative during the first half of the second quarter turned positive in the last six weeks  coinciding with taking the returns program national  The positive swing in comp sales may indicate the success of the partnership and investors should pay close attention to that metric in the upcoming report 
Our consensus Q3 estimates forecast net sales to pop 0 46  to  4 65 billion and for earnings to decline 14 29  to  0 84 per share  Comp sales are estimated to come in at 0 5   and Kohl s is predicted to add 73 more stores from the previous quarter  Looking ahead to fiscal 2020  estimates call for a top line fall of 1 88  to  19 85 billion and a 6 79  drop in earnings to  5 22 per share 
Bottom Line
Kohl s is in the middle of a restructuring effort that it hopes can help it better compete in the modern retail market  The contraction that has hit the retail sector  and especially department stores  has driven Kohl s forward multiple to discounted levels  Depending on what next week s report indicates  the company may be seen as a value stock that is in the middle of a come up or just another department store destined to succumb to the retail apocalypse

143480,364995,KSS,U S  holiday returns surge with booming e commerce,news,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES  Reuters     United Parcel  Service Inc  N UPS  on Thursday expects to ship 1 9 million gifts and other items back to U S  retailers as e commerce fuels an anticipated 26  year over year volume surge on  National Returns Day  
Jan  2 is the busiest day for holiday returns in the United States  U S  shoppers return more packages than their peers around the globe  spurred by free shipping on orders and returns   costly perks that squeeze retailer profits 
About 10  of goods sold in the United States go back to retailers every year  resulting in roughly  369 billion in lost sales  according to a 2018 report from Appriss Retail and National Retail Federation 
Apparel is an outsized contributor  Returns in some categories approach 50  due to inconsistent sizing across brands  said Greg Buzek  founder and president of IHL Group  a research and advisory firm 
 That causes great expense for retailers   said Buzek  who estimated that annual global losses from retail returns are nearly  1 trillion   up from  600 billion in 2015 
A new crop of startups aims to take the bite out of returns 
Los Angeles based Happy Returns promises to slash returns related expenses up to 30  by reducing shipping costs and customer support calls 
It has 700  return bars  in U S  retail stores and shopping malls  where customers drop off items and arrange refunds or exchanges  The company charges retailers a flat fee for every item it processes 
 You have to have some free  return  option  Nobody said it had to be the mail   said Happy Returns Chief Executive David Sobie 
Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  also encourages shoppers to return products to its own physical stores or Kohl s  N KSS  locations  where eligible items are packed and shipped for free 
While 30  of shoppers return items to stores  more than twice that many opt for shipping  according to UPS  2019 Pulse of the Online Shopper report  UPS said it handled more than 1 million returns each day in December  but declined to give an annual total 
UPS and home furnishing retailer IKEA are among the investors in Optoro Inc  which helps retailers sort  resell and dispose of returned merchandise more efficiently 
The aim is to prevent products from sitting in a back room losing value or getting routed and rerouted at great expense  said Larisa Summers  Optoro s senior vice president of e commerce 
 You have to welcome these goods back  otherwise customers won t shop with you the first time   Summers said ",2019-12-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-holiday-returns-surge-with-booming-ecommerce-2050613,2050613

Kohl s shares have lost about 27 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 16 6  
What s Next for Kohl s 
While Kohl s has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Trump reportedly made the threat while speaking at the White House during a cabinet meeting  CNBC reported  


Sentiment on a U S  China trade deal has soured in recent weeks amid uncertainty over whether Beijing will agree to consummate the Phase One trade deal  which was agreed to in October  China reportedly wants the U S  to roll back previously imposed tariffs before it will ratify the terms of the proposed trade deal  Reports have also suggested that China s unwillingness to agree to commit to a sizable purchase of U S  agriculture goods had also stifled progress on trade  Trump previously suggested that Beijing had agreed to purchase  50 billion worth agricultural goods

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from KSS as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be August 20  2019  On that day  KSS is projected to report earnings of  1 56 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 11 36   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  4 48 billion  down 1 9  from the year ago period 
KSS s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  5 31 per share and revenue of  19 93 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  5 18  and  1 47   respectively 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for KSS  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system

143540,365055,KSS,Analysts Estimate Kohl s  KSS  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Kohl s  KSS  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 20  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 56 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 4  
Revenues are expected to be  4 49 billion  down 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kohl s 
For Kohl s  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 48  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kohl s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kohl s would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  8 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kohl s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-kohls-kss-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200454653,200454653

143564,365079,KSS,Bear Of The Day  Kohl s  KSS ,opinion,"The department store segment has taken a beating over the last few years with this year only exacerbating the issue  Kohl s  KSS  is no expectation to this trend  having lost 30  of its market value since the beginning of 2019  Sell side analysts are becoming increasingly pessimistic about KSS and have been lowering EPS estimates considerably for the next couple years pushing this stock into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  Price and Consensus   Analysts are expecting negative growth on both the top and bottom lines for 2019  with an 11 5  EPS estimate drop in the last 90 days  The most recent earnings results illustrated a significant miss and the start of a downward trend in sales and profitability  Millennials are now the largest consuming generation and this is creating a dynamic consumer environment that department stores have been unable to keep up with 
Millennials are a progressively online generation and aren t walking into stores as much as they use to  This is having a significant negative impact on department stores like Kohl s whose business model relies on brick and mortar retail 
Kohl s most recent attempt to grow foot traffic in their stores was the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Returns program  This program is allowing Amazon customers the ability to return unwanted products to Kohl s  Considering the extremely volume that Amazon deals with daily  this program is giving Amazon some relief from the heavy flow of goods 
The transaction is peculiar because at first glance Kohl s is gaining nothing and it s actually costing them more in logistics expenses because no money is changing hands  In the most recent earnings call  Kohl s CEO Michelle Gass  confirmed this suspicion  saying that this will indeed cost Kohl s  What they hope to gain out of this deal is foot track into their stores 
I believe that this program could easily backfire with the increased return of foot traffic not covering the logistical costs needed for a positive return on investment  These consumers are going to Kohl s to return something not buy anything new  the likelihood of them making a purchase is much lower the traditional foot traffic from true Kohl s consumers going there to spend 
Take Away
The outlook of the department store industry is grim with our increasingly online lifestyles  I would stay away from these investments as their core clientele is aging  Kohl s has seen a consistent decrease in national store square footage over the past 5 years and I expect this trend to continue 
KSS has all the momentum going against it  although it is trading at multiples that are in line with the industry average  I wouldn t put on a short position on this security quit yet  but I would limit exposure to the department store segment

143589,365104,KSS,Why Is Kohl s  KSS  Down 12 3  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Kohl s  KSS   Shares have lost about 12 3  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Kohl s due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Kohl s Q1 Earnings Lag Estimates  Outlook Slashed Kohl s posted dismal first quarter fiscal 2019 results  Adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and declined 4 7  on a year over year basis  This can be accountable to soft revenues and increased SG A expenses Total revenues came in at  4 087 million  which fell 2 9  from the prior year quarter  Moreover  the figure came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 203 million  Net sales also decreased 3 3  to  3 821 million  while other revenues grew 4 3  to  266 million in the quarter Further  comps declined 3 4  against growth of 3 6  recorded in the year ago quarter  This crushed the company s positive comps record of six straight quarters Moving on  gross margin fell 6 basis points  bps  to 36 8  in the reported quarter  SG A expenses as  percentage of sales expanded 130 bps to 31 2   Further  operating income came in at  118 million  down from the prior year quarter s  210 million Other Financial DetailsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  543 million  long term debt of  1 855 million and shareholders  equity of  5 442 million  The company generated net cash from operating activities of  136 million during the first quarter On May 15  Kohl s announced a quarterly cash dividend of 67 cents per share  which is payable on Jun 26  2019  to stockholders of record as on Jun 12 Other DevelopmentsThe company unveiled a long term contract with Fanatics to widen the fan gear product range for Kohl s online customers  Fanatics is a leading worldwide name for licensed sports merchandise  The wide range of products  including team apparel  jerseys and other merchandise categories  will be available to Kohl s online shoppers from fall 2019 GuidanceKohl s clearly began fiscal 2019 on a soft note  owing to the weaker than anticipated sales  However  the company is on track with its sales driving initiatives  which are likely to enhance its performance in the second half  To this end  management is particularly encouraged about the nationwide rollout of its returns program with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  along with other extended programs and brand launches While the company is focused on efficient cost management  it is somewhat conservative about fiscal 2019  Consequently  Kohl s slashed its bottom line view and envisions earnings per share to be  5 15  5 45  down from the prior projection of  5 80  6 15 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  17 18  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
Currently  Kohl s has a nice Growth Score of B  a grade with the same score on the momentum front  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Kohl s has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-kohls-kss-down-123-since-last-earnings-report-200433341,200433341

JC Penney   NYSE JCP   also released its quarterly results today  missing its already pessimistic EPS by 18   JCP just reported its worst sales figures in the firm s observable history  since before the 2000s   This company has been struggling to keep its head above water as discounted competitors and online retail pressures continue to push it under  JCP is currently sitting at Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and I don t see this status changing anytime soon 
Department Store Industry
The broader department store industry has been getting hammered over the past 52 weeks  with the industry as a whole being down around 19   Kohl s 52 week returns just turned negative today with its disappointing Q1 results  JCP has fallen 56  this year so far and has plummeted 97 6  since its high in 2012  I see no reason why this cash burning machine wouldn t fall further 
Part of the addition pain that KSS  blue  and its investors experienced today is due to the stock outperforming its peers YTD as you can see below 
 
Macy s   NYSE M   was able to beat EPS earnings in its Q1 results reported last week by over 40  and only slightly missed its sales estimates  This still represented a year over year decline in both sales and EPS  M is down 3 5  since this report  Macy s is expected to see declines on both their top and bottom lines over the next couple years 
The S P 500 is up over 53  in the last 5 years with the US remaining in one of the strongest and longest bull markets on record  Department store retailers  on the other hand  have lost investors over 46  in the same time frame  With this segment unable to perform when the economy is strong  how will they keep their head above sea level when the waters get tough  5 year chart comparing S P 500  red  vs  Department Store Industry  blue  below 
 
Discount Retail 
While the department store industry is declining  discount retailers like TJX   NYSE TJX   have been flourishing  With the overall discount industry up 17  and TJX up even more 
TJX beat both EPS and sales estimates in its Q1 financial release this morning  They showed 6 8  year over year growth for the top line and were able to keep EPS results unchanged from Q1 2018  TJX  blue  has outperformed the S P 500  red  by more than 30 percentage points in the past 5 year 
 
Amid the brick and mortar retail decline  discount retailers like TJ Maxx and Marshalls are somehow able to continue growing  Over the last 10 years  sales and profits have gone nowhere but up  TJX has been able to consistently open more and more stores  increasing their store count by over 26  in the past 4 years 
How have discount retailers like TJX been able to compete in an ever growing e com economy  They must be giving retailers something they can t find online 
Millennials are driving consumer s trends in today s economy  and they have an attraction to savvy shopping  They love the feeling of finding  diamonds in the rough   which is what TJ Maxx and Marshalls allow consumers to feel  The ability to find name brand products at a bargain is what is keeping TJX the growing retail powerhouse it is 
Take Away
Department stores are a dying breed as discount retailers and online shopping displace the need for consumers to tediously navigate their way through these massive stores  On the other hand  discount retailers have been able to drive growth through their ability to satisfy consumers  needs wants  I would stay away from dying department store stocks like M  JCP  and KSS  Look to buy growing discount retailers like TJX as they continue to outperform the market

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  8 96   A quarter ago  it was expected that this department store operator would post earnings of  2 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 24  delivering a surprise of 3 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Kohl s  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry  posted revenues of  4 09 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 76   This compares to year ago revenues of  4 21 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Kohl s shares have lost about 5 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 3  
What s Next for Kohl s 
While Kohl s has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Kohl s was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 90 on  4 59 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 03 on  20 21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

143614,365129,KSS,Kohl s Tanks After Missing Every Metric  Sell Near Term Bounce,opinion,"Summary
Kohl s Corp   NYSE KSS   dropped 12  Tuesday after the company missed expectations for earnings  revenue  and guidance 
While its market cycles point to a coming bounce  we believe that will be an opportunity to sell the stock 

The company reported earnings per share of  0 61 and total revenue of  3 8 billion  compared to analyst estimates of  0 68 and  3 9 billion  Comparable stores sales also fell by a wider margin than expected as the company revised guidance lower 
CEO Michelle Gass explained   The year has started off slower than we d like  with our first quarter sales coming in below our expectation  But we are actively addressing the opportunities that impacted our first quarter performance  
In analyzing the market cycles for KSS  we believe the stock is in the declining phase of its current cycle  The stock failed late last year  never fully recovered  and investors are now capitulating  We believe that support near  54 should hold  but the coming rebound could be an opportunity to sell

143633,365148,KSS,This Is Why Kohl s  KSS  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Kohl s in Focus
Headquartered in Menomonee Falls  Kohl s  KSS  is a Retail Wholesale stock that has seen a price change of  3 87  so far this year  The department store operator is paying out a dividend of  0 67 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 2  compared to the Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s yield of 0 69  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 95  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 68 is up 9 8  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Kohl s has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 12   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Kohl s s current payout ratio is 43   This means it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
KSS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 04 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 7 86  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  KSS is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-kohls-kss-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200422543,200422543

Kohl s in Focus
Kohl s  KSS  is headquartered in Menomonee Falls  and is in the Retail Wholesale sector  The stock has seen a price change of 7 18  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 67 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 77   In comparison  the Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s yield is 0 66   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 86

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that KSS is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-kohls-kss-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200413739,200413739
143652,365167,KSS,Is Kohl s  KSS  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Kohl s  KSS  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this department store operator a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Kohl s is 3 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  1 3

143685,365200,KSS,Bull Of The Day  Kohl s Corporation  KSS  ,opinion,"As Amazon  has decimated the traditional retail landscape with its popular online marketplace  we ve been hearing about the imminent demise of brick and mortar retailers for years  Old habits are hard to break however  and especially in the apparel business  many customers continue to prefer an in person shopping experience 
Savvy traditional retailers like Kohl s Corporation  are actually adapting quite well to this new environment  restyling and re sizing store locations and engaging in innovative partnership opportunities  Recent changes at Kohl s allow the company to continue offering a wide variety of desirable brands in retail locations  and at prices that are competitive with online sellers 
Kohl s calls the strategy to optimize retail locations  rightsizing  which means matching the square footage of stores to customer foot traffic and inventory needs  In some cases this means making the stores smaller  and stores that remain the same physical size still get optimized with new interior layouts but become  operationally smaller  through reductions in inventory and improved displays and fixtures 
Kohl s also started a pilot program in to share five retail locations with Aldi Supermarket stores and recently added a plan to co locate with 10 Planet Fitness Gyms 
These partnerships appear to be win win situations in that they reduce one of the most significant cost for physical stores   rent   for Aldi and Planet Fitness  while encouraging more foot traffic for Kohl s stores by being located next to businesses that still attract customers to physical locations and are naturally resistant to online competition   
The Planet Fitness partnership is also a good fit for Kohl s renewed focus on Active Athletic apparel which includes expanding into new categories like golf and outerwear  Active Athletic sales at Kohl s have doubled over the past four years and now make up 20  of business 
Kohl s is also operating 13 experimental  Small Format  stores which   at 35 000 square feet   have 60  less physical space and also 60  less inventory than the standard size stores  The spaces are designed to be flexible and efficient and also serve as locations where customers can pick up  and exchange or return  purchases that they have made online through the company s website 
These smaller stores will likely be key to Kohl s partnership with the online giant itself   Amazon   in which Kohl s will sell the Amazon Echo and other devices in 200 of their stores and also allow in person returns of products purchased on Amazon 
Returns and exchanges have remained a challenge for online retailers and many customers continue to prefer executing them in in person  rather than using the mail or shipping services  Kohl s CEO  Michelle Gass describes the Amazon partnership  and specifically the returns initiative  as an opportunity for the two companies to  leverage each other s strengths  
Financials
After a difficult end to 2018   along with the rest of the equity markets   a series of recent earnings beats has Kohl s shares rising again  and future estimates continue to rise  All 10 of the analysts who s coverage is included in the Zacks rank for Kohl s have raised their expectations for the current fiscal year in the past 60 days  earning the innovative retailer a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
The shares still trade at a forward P E ratio of less than 12X  Compared to approximately 17X for the S P 500  and also pay an attractive dividend yield of 3 75  annually 
The improved earnings situation at Kohl s is due simultaneously to increased revenue expectations as well as an intense focus on cost controls  The company has maintained General and Administrative expenses below 28  of gross revenues for the past 5 years  preserving precious margins in an industry that has seen many costs balloon over the same period 
Initiatives like the aforementioned rent sharing deals are evidence that management is creatively looking for business solutions that simultaneously hold down expenses and increase store traffic 
The Amazon partnership proves that not only is Kohl s not threatened by the dominance of the world s biggest retailer  they re actually using it to their advantage   collaborating and creating synergies rather than competing head to head in unwinnable battles 
Arguably  the most important characteristic for management in an industry is the ability and willingness to adapt as the landscape changes 
Though the Retail sector has seen a unique set of challenges over the past few years  Kohl s is clearly at the top of the heap when it comes to engineering novel solutions

143686,365201,KSS,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Kohl s  KSS  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Kohl s in Focus
Kohl s  KSS  is headquartered in Menomonee Falls  and is in the Retail Wholesale sector  The stock has seen a price change of 5 11  since the start of the year  The department store operator is paying out a dividend of  0 67 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 84  compared to the Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s yield of 0 64  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 68 is up 9 8  from last year  Kohl s has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11 83   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Kohl s s current payout ratio is 43   This means it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
KSS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 02 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 7 50  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that KSS is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-kohls-kss-could-be-a-great-choice-200406742,200406742
143687,365202,KSS,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Kohl s  KSS  Now,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Kohl s  KSS  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this department store operator is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Kohl s is 3 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 7 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  1  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Kohl s is 11 6   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 6 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 1 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of  2 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Kohl s have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Kohl s a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

143726,365241,KSS,Here s Why Kohl s  KSS  Stock Looks Appealing Post Q4 Results,opinion,Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is surely worth a shot  given its robust sales driving endeavors  which helped the company put up a superb show in the recently reported fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results  Notably  shares of the company have gained more than 3  since it reported results on Mar 5  Further  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has rallied almost 13  in the past three months  against the  s decline of 0 4   You can see Let s delve deeper into Kohl s growth story Solid Comps Fuel Q4 Results  View Looks ImpressiveKohl s has been gaining from its sturdy comparable store sales  comps  trend  which continued to fuel performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  thereby encouraging management to provide an impressive outlook for fiscal 2019  Kohl s has been making robust efforts to draw shoppers and improve sales  These endeavors have helped the company deliver positive comps for six straight quarters now  Incidentally  comps registered an increase of 1  in the fourth quarter  largely buoyed by a solid holiday season performance  Comps benefitted from strength in both store and digital channels  reflecting the company s robust marketing endeavors and product assortments Competitor store closures also aided sales growth in the said period and are expected to remain a tailwind to market share growth  Further  we note that Kohl s comps have been gaining from the company s Greatness Agenda initiative  and focus on boosting traffic and enhancing operational excellence Coming back to fourth quarter performance  both top and bottom lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The bottom line also improved year over year  Notably  this marked the company s seventh straight quarter of revenue beat  while earnings surpassed the consensus mark for the fifth time in a row  Kohl s is focused on boosting traffic and expects comps growth to be flat to up 2  in fiscal 2019  Further  management expects adjusted earnings per share of  5 80  6 15 compared with  5 60 recorded in fiscal 2018 Kohl s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   E Commerce Business Looks StrongThe company has experienced significant growth in its e commerce business since the last few years  Markedly  digital sales witnessed double digit increase during the fourth quarter  on the back of favorable impacts from the company s customer centric investments  Notably  mobile sales continued to be a significant driver  forming more than 50  of the company s digital sales and about 70  of traffic improvement  We note that the company s endeavors to boost mobile traffic have augmented the adoption of the Kohl app  making it a vital constituent of online sales  Moreover  in order to improve its online offerings  Kohl s has been expanding its e commerce fulfillment centers Other efforts to bolster digital sales include Smart Cart  BOPIS  Your Price and personalized search  Also  Kohl s is on track to consolidate its call centers that provide support services to the company s online and Kohl s Charge customers Inventory Management Efforts Boost MarginsKohl s efficient inventory management involves four key strategies  which have been helping the company achieve cleaner inventory levels  In this regard  Kohl s standard to small initiative has been lowering inventory and boosting profitability  Further  the company s localization efforts have enabled it to bring the appropriate product in the apt store at the right time  Moving on  Kohl s is gaining from its speed initiative  which facilitates improved flow of receipts in order to match demand  Finally  Kohl s concentrates on strategically lowering consumer choices  while augmenting depth in core products  Such efforts have been leading to per store inventory reductions for 12 straight quarters now  aiding the gross margin  in turn In fourth quarter fiscal 2018  the company s inventory per store decreased 2  that helped gross margin expand 1 basis point  bp  even amid headwinds like unfavorable mix stemming from increased digital sales penetration  In fiscal 2019  gross margin is likely to rise up to 10 bps year over year These factors along with focus on partnerships and innovation are likely to help Kohl s keep its solid momentum alive Looking for More  Check These Solid Retail StocksFoot Locker

143761,365276,KSS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Lululemon  Macy   s  Kohl   s  Nike And Adidas,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  January 15  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU    Macy s   NYSE M    Kohl s   NYSE KSS    Nike   NYSE NKE   and Adidas   OTC ADDYY   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Lululemon  LULU  Looks Like a Buy After Raising Q4 GuidanceShares of Lululemon soared as high as 8  in morning trading Monday after the yoga apparel powerhouse raised its Q4 earnings and revenue guidance  Lululemon s announcement came after Macy s and Kohl s failed to impress investors with their holiday sales last week  So  let s see why Lululemon looks like a buy as it expands its market share alongside giants like Nike and Adidas Updated Q4 Guidance Lululemon said Monday before management meets with analysts and investors at the ICR Conference in Orlando that it raised its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance to between  1 140 billion and  1 150 billion  up from  1 115 billion to  1 125 billion The Vancouver  Canada based firm upped its guidance based on total comparable sales growth in the mid to high teens during the quarter that included the vital holiday shopping period  Lululemon had previously projected comps growth in the high single to low double digits Meanwhile  the athleisure giant lifted its adjusted quarterly earnings guidance from between  1 64 and  1 67 per share to a range of  1 72 to  1 74 a share   The momentum in our business remained strong throughout the holiday season  reflecting the ongoing success of our product offerings and our connection with guests around the globe   CEO Calvin McDonald said Lululemon stock popped the  in morning trading on the back of the announcement  Shares climbed to as high as  145 Monday and hovered up around 6  at  140 13 a share through early afternoon trading  Investors should note that shares of LULU still rest roughly 15  below their 52 week high of  164 79  which sets up a solid buying opportunity for those high on the expanding athleisure firm Outlook   Earnings Trends Our Zacks Consensus Estimate had called for Lulu s Q4 revenues to jump 21 5  to  1 13 billion  The company s full year revenues are projected to surge 22 6  to touch  3 25 billion At the bottom end of the income statement  Lululemon is projected to see its Q4 earnings soar 27 8  to  1 70 a share  Plus  the athletic apparel company s full year earnings are expected to surge 42 9  to reach  3 70 a share  With that said  investors should remember that our estimates will likely climb as analysts update their projections based on the firm s newly released guidance We should also note that even before LULU raised its quarterly guidance that the firm had earned a ton of positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days  These revisions mean that at least some analysts expect Lululemon s earnings to expand even more than they did as recently as seven days ago Bottom LineLululemon is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  based  in large part  on its recent earnings estimate revision activity  The company also boasts  A  grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system Lululemon has also been able to expand its consumer base as part of the growing athleisure market  which isn t expected to fade anytime soon  The company s success in the quickly growing yoga based apparel market has forced the likes of Nike and Adidas to adapt More specifically  the firm sees its newer outwear division as a comps driver across both its men s and women s segments  Lululemon currently sells men s and women s parkas for as much as  600 as it tries to compete against other high end brands  Lulu is also testing out a new loyalty program as retailers try to navigate a brand obsessed retail age Furthermore  Lululemon also hopes to break into the self care market where giants have partnered with trendy  subscription based services in

143764,365279,KSS,Tiffany Stock Up More Than 5  In Spite Of Soft Holiday Sales,opinion,Like many other retailers  Tiffany   Co    NYSE TIF   also posted soft sales for the two months ended Dec 31  2018  or the popularly known holiday season  Results were significantly impacted by reduced sales to foreign tourists and lower demand from local customers in Europe and Americas  Also  the company slightly lowered its outlook for fiscal 2018 and issued an initial view for fiscal 2019 Despite witnessing a decline in sales and comparable sales  comps   shares of this jewelry retailer gained 5 4  during the trading session on Jan 18  This aided Tiffany s one month price performance  Notably  shares of the company jumped 21   better than the  s growth of 16 1   Some industry experts believe that the bullish stance following the holiday sales results could be attributable to robust sales growth noted in mainland China and Japan  while the company s global e commerce sales were also favorable during the season Apart from Tiffany  retailers like Macy s   NYSE M    Kohl s   NYSE KSS   and J  C  Penney Company   NYSE JCP   posted unimpressive holiday sales numbers  Coming back to Tiffany  let s delve deeper into the company s sales numbers and outlook  Tiffany s Holiday SalesThe company s worldwide net sales slipped 1  to  1 04 billion  whereas comps dipped 2   On a constant currency  cc  basis  net sales and comps remained flat year over year  Region wise  net sales fell 1  in the Americas to  514 million  whereas comps were in line with the year ago quarter s figure  Results in the region were hurt by reduced spending by local consumers as well as tourists Net sales dropped 3  to  226 million in Asia Pacific  as strength in mainland China was more than offset by weakness across various other markets  mainly due to lower tourist sales  Comps in the region were down 4   However  net sales jumped 4  to  150 million in Japan  with comps seeing equal growth  This was backed by increased spending by local consumers  Moving on  net sales in Europe were down 4  to  132 million and comps fell 5   A modest fall in spending by both local and foreign tourist consumers dented results  Other net sales tumbled 11  to  14 million  owing to soft comps across five U A E  stores Category wise  Jewelry Collections sales grew 2  during the holiday season  while sales of Engagement Jewelry and Designer Jewelry categories saw respective downsides of 3  and 8   Tiffany operated 321 stores as of Dec 31  2018  including 124 in Americas  47 in Europe  55 in Japan  five in the U A E and 90 in Asia Pacific What s in Store for Fiscal 2018   2019 While Tiffany s holiday sales lagged management s expectations  the company remains committed toward its six key strategies that were unveiled last year  It expects to post record earnings and sales in fiscal 2018  The company is also hopeful about making further progress in fiscal 2019  wherein it plans to make additional product launches  enhance its marketing endeavors  and focus on store expansions and website improvements  However  fiscal 2019  mainly first half  is likely to witness roadblocks stemming from tough year over year sales comparisons  external pressures and annualized internal expenditure That said  management envisions fiscal 2018 worldwide net sales growth of 6 7   on a reported and cc basis  Earlier  management projected net sales to increase high single digit percentage on a reported and constant exchange rate basis  Comps are still expected to rise mid single digits Management expects operating margin in fiscal 2018 to decline year over year  owing to a considerable rise in SG A costs  likely to be somewhat cushioned by improved gross margin  Owing to these factors  Tiffany now expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share at the low end of its previously guided range of  4 65  4 80 For fiscal 2019  management provided its preliminary outlook and expects worldwide net sales to rise at a low single digit rate  on a reported and cc basis  Earnings are likely to rise at a mid single digit rate  with the first half expected to face sales related challenges owing to soft tourist spending and anticipated currency headwinds  Also  increased expenses related to certain investments are anticipated to weigh on the company s first half performance Nonetheless  this Zacks Rank  3

143778,365293,KSS,Wall Street falls on China  NAFTA concerns,news,"By Sinead Carew NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street s major stock indexes pared earlier losses on Wednesday while U S  Treasury yields fell from their peak as investor skepticism grew about a report that China would slow purchases of U S  government bonds  Financial stocks were still the biggest percentage gainers by late afternoon  however  as investors reacted to the Bloomberg report on China  the world s biggest holder of U S  Treasuries  The S P 500 pared some losses after falling as much as 0 6 percent after the report  which also pushed the dollar down   As the day wore on  Treasury yields started to move lower on the realization the story doesn t have any legs  That s definitely helped equities  There s no way on earth the Chinese stop buying U S  Treasuries   said Robert Pavlik  chief investment strategist  SlateStone Wealth in New York  The S P also dipped on a Reuters report saying Canada is increasingly convinced President Donald Trump will soon announce the United States intends to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement  The report cited two unnamed government sources  At 2 47 p m   1947 GMT   the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  was down 30 points  or 0 12 percent  to 25 355 8  the S P 500  SPX  had lost 6 01 points  or 0 22 percent  to 2 745 28 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  had dropped 25 29 points  or 0 35 percent  to 7 138 29  The China report put the S P and the Nasdaq on track to snap a six day run of record closing highs as investors worried that the market was overdue for a correction   It s a reflection of investor weariness and awareness that the market has risen for four straight months without seeing a major pullback   said Pavlik   They re on alert in case something develops   The S P financial index  SPSY  was last up 0 8 percent  helped by gains in  Wells Fargo   N WFC    Berkshire Hathaway   N BRKa  and JPMorgan  N JPM   Banks and insurance companies often rise with bond yields as investors expect a profit boost from higher interest rates  Rate sensitive sectors such as utilities  SPLRCU  and real estate  were the biggest percentage losers of the S P s 11 major sectors   The China report weakened the dollar  DXY   which was last down 0 2 percent  while safe haven commodity gold  jumped to its highest in four months  Investors started the New year optimistic about global growth prospects and with high expectations for a strong U S  quarterly earnings season which kicks off on Friday with reports from big banks  Earnings for S P 500 companies are expected to increase by 11 8 percent  with the biggest contribution from the energy sector  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKb  rose 1 2 percent after the conglomerate promoted two top executives  cementing their status as the most likely successors to Warren Buffett  Shares of  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  gained 2 percent as No 2 U S  homebuilder s orders and total revenue rose more than expected in the fourth quarter  The Dow Jones Transport index  DJT   often seen as a gauge of the economy s health  pared its gains and was last up 0 1 percent after climbing as much as 0 7 percent following United Continental s  N UAL  report of higher traffic for December  Department store operator Kohl s  N KSS  rose about 3 2 percent after two brokerages raised their price targets  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1 72 to 1 ratio  on Nasdaq  a 1 18 to 1 ratio favored decliners

143782,365297,KSS,Market Thin  Heads Spin  Holiday Week Offers No Respite From Volatility,opinion," Thursday Market Open  Market volatility doesn t appear to be taking any time off for the holidays 
A day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  posted its largest ever single day points gain  the market appears poised to head in the opposite direction 
The up and down is perhaps not that surprising given that many market participants may be out of their offices during the traditional holiday period between Christmas and the new year  Light volume can exaggerate market moves up or down  On Wednesday  volume was substantially lighter than average for the broad market represented by the S P 500  SPX    The  DJI saw heavier than average volume while the Nasdaq Composite s  COMP  lighter volume was less marked than that of the SPX  
While yesterday s rally may have taken stocks into overbought territory  from a short term standpoint anyway  it s also possible that certain underlying worries that haven t gone away are capping the market s attempt at a Santa Claus rally  In addition to market volatility  investors may also be worried as the partial U S  government shutdown continues  European political risk still looms  and trade issues between the U S  and China haven t been settled 
A Reuters report saying that the Trump administration is considering banning U S  companies from purchasing telecommunications equipment from Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763  added to the tension between the world s two largest economies  Meanwhile  data on China s industrial sector showed profits declined for the first time since late 2015  apparently casting more doubt on global economic growth 
Although Wall Street s main fear gauge  the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   fell sharply Wednesday  it still remained above 30 for much of the day  indicating that market participants continued to be uneasy  And  while government debt yields rose on Wednesday  they were up from low levels  The 10 year Treasury remained well below the key 3  level as market participants had likely been buying Treasuries as a perceived safe haven investment recently  although no investment is completely safe    See chart below  
Retailers Lead Wednesday Rally
All three major U S  indices jumped sharply on Wednesday  the first trading day after the worst Christmas Eve session on record  The  DJI posted its best ever session for points gained  while the SPX and COMP put in their strongest performances since March 2009 
But remember  Prior to Wednesday s sharp rally  the SPX had fallen 15  in the month of December  In other words  as sharp as the rally may have been  it would take several of them to get the stock market back to where it was on Thanksgiving 
Even as some people on Main Street may have been heading out to the mall to burn off some of that holiday roast  consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest gainers on Wall Street  The sector rose more than 6   led by Kohl s  NYSE KSS  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  in percentage terms 
Gains for the sector seem to have been helped on news that holiday sales increased 5 1 percent year over year to more than  850 billion this year  The data came from Mastercard  NYSE MA  SpendingPulse in a press release aptly datelined Purchase  New York  This year marked the strongest growth over the last six years  Mastercard  MA  said  adding that online shopping posted a gain of 19 1 percent over 2017   See more below  
Speaking of online sales  AMZN finished higher after the internet retailing giant said Wednesday it had a record holiday season as customers ordered more items worldwide than ever before 
The upbeat news from the retail sector shows that the consumer  which accounts for a huge chunk of the U S  economy  is healthy and optimistic enough to get out and spend or stay at the keyboard and spend despite the volatility that the stock market has seen in November and December 
Energy Sector A Close Runner Up
Meanwhile  the energy sector was only slightly behind the consumer discretionary sector  also posting a gain of more than 6  as oil prices climbed sharply  The rally in oil prices  and in stocks for that matter  could be due in part to a bounce from oversold conditions  with market participants wanting to buy the dip 
It also seems like Wednesday s increased appetite for riskier assets helped oil  And it could be that oil traders and investors are feeling more optimistic about global demand for black gold  taking their cue from stronger sentiment in the equities market 
Still  the oil market is coming off a year of high supply  and we ll have to see if economic conditions are favorable enough to help soak up a sufficient amount of that supply to move oil prices meaningfully higher  Crude prices were down in early Thursday trading 

Risk Indicators  The VIX  shown as a bar chart  has come down from recent highs  and Treasury yields  as represented by a purple line showing the 10 year Treasury Index  have risen  But  overall  volatility has remained high as investor sentiment has generally been risk off  Data Source  Cboe Global Markets  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Consumer Discretion  With the consumer discretionary sector the best performer on Wednesday amid bullish news on holiday spending  it could be interesting to delve a little deeper into Mastercard s Wednesday report detailing retail spending from Nov  1 through Christmas Eve  Despite pockets of poor weather including a cold Black Friday morning on the East Coast  total apparel sales grew at the fastest rate since 2010  notching a gain of 7 9  over 2017  according to the report  Meanwhile  consumers continued to spend on home improvements  pushing holiday sales in that category up 9   Home furniture and furnishings sales grew 2 3   Perhaps unsurprisingly  given the closings at brick and mortar stores and competition from internet sales  holiday spending at department stores fell 1 3 percent  This segment isn t taking the competition from the internet lying down  though  as online sales for department stores grew 10 2   However  holiday retail sales of electronics and appliances fell 0 7  
A Cure for High Prices  There s an old adage that high prices cure high prices  That may be happening in the housing market  which has been facing an affordability crunch amid rising mortgage rates  On Wednesday  the latest S P CoreLogic Case Shiller 20 city composite home price index showed a year over year gain of 5   which was in line with expectations and down from the prior month s annual rate of 5 2   Apparently  declining demand could be causing housing price growth to moderate a bit  Also  mortgage rates have come down recently  but they still remain higher than they were a couple years ago   The combination of higher mortgage rates and higher home prices rising faster than incomes and wages means fewer people can afford to buy a house   said David Blitzer  managing director and chairman of the index committee at S P Dow Jones Indices   Reduced affordability is slowing sales of both new and existing single family homes

Key Events
This morning  European stocks and futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 abruptly halted the momentum provided by yesterday s monster US rally  with the STOXX 600 s early climb quickly turning into a second day slide while US contracts all edged more than 1 percent lower  Except for a 3 88 percent jump on Japan s Nikkei  sentiment fizzled out after US shares managed to post an outstanding comeback from the cusp of a bear market in Wednesday s US session  Major indices jumped the most since March 2009  gaining about 5 percent with the Dow scoring a record win of over 1 050 points 

The yield on 10 year Treasurys is falling  as traders are once again shifting funds from risky assets to safer ones 

The yen is rising against the dollar  paring half of yesterday s loss

Global Financial Affairs

On Wednesday  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  stock capped a record holiday season by surging 9 45 percent  closing a mere 0 14 percent beneath the top of the session and completing a powerful morning star pattern  with no overlap between the pattern s three candles a rare occurrence  Also  the third  green candle engulfed the first  red candle  also rare  However  the stock  as well as the broader market  remains in a downtrend  as highlighted by yesterday s trading volume  as forceful as the bulls may have been  participation has been less than that seen on Monday  when the morning star began 
Amazon s success helped the broader market bounce back  easing fears of a looming recession in an economy where consumer spending makes up 65 percent of the GDP 
Mastercard  NYSE MA  and Visa  NYSE V  rebounded after four days of declines  Mastercard said holiday sales increased 5 1 per cent to more than US 850 billion this year  marking the strongest growth in six years  Online shopping saw gains of 19 per cent compared with 2017  according to Mastercard SpendingPulse 
Bricks and mortar retailers also gained  Nike  NYSE NKE  jumped 7 21 percent  engulfing almost four candles  Macy s  NYSE M  surged 7 03 percent  posting an even more powerful morning star  with the green candle engulfing two red candles  Kohl s  NYSE KSS  leaped 10 25 percent  wiping out nearly all December s losses  PVH  NYSE PVH  jumped 6 14 percent  also erasing three days of losses  Again  all these impressive gains were made on volume lower than Monday s rout 
However  as much as these company reports may have placated some of the growing doubts over US economic growth  it was first and foremost an act of political reassurance that convinced investors to pull out all the stops 

Kevin Hasset  Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers  told reporters that Jerome Powell s post as Chair of the Federal Reserve is  one hundred percent safe   driving stocks into an instant rally 
Further pushing shares higher were reports that a US delegation will be traveling to Beijing in January  for trade talks  The argument could be made that it would only take one more move by the Fed to tone down its hawkish stance a notch  allowing stocks to return to an uptrend  However  lingering political instability in the US and a global economic slowdown would still pose significant headwinds 
The S P 500 jumped 4 96 percent during yesterday s session  Energy   6 22 percent  outperformed  tracking the more than 8 pecent rally in crude oil  Communication Services   5 62 percent  and Technology   6 04 percent  followed  FAANG stocks have proved to be the market leaders  in both downward and upward directions  Naturally  defensive shares in the Utilities sector   1 36   were the day s laggard 
The Dow Jones gained 4 98 percent  or 1 086 points its biggest recorded leap on an absolute point basis  The NASDAQ Composite was the main winner of the session   5 84   thanks to the outperformance of tech shares  The Russell 2000 climbed 4 55 percent 
We have been warning about rising volatility for months  Seeing equities rebound from the worst Christmas Eve performance ever  the weakest December on record and nearly the most disastrous quarterly performance since 2008 to the biggest rally since 2009 is a sign of the times 
We had forecast a rally  though one that would be limited to the short term  The latest price moves described can be likened to the last flicker of a candle before the flame dies out  equities are still very much in a downtrend  and we expect them to slip into a full fledged bear market after this rally 
In line with the general risk off shift  WTI crude is down 2 08 percent  trimming yesterday s 7 49 percent surge  which had been spurred by optimism on global economic demand  Oil s price moves into 2019 could be driven by many of the same catalysts that weighed on the commodity in 2018

com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Asbury Automotive Group  Inc    NYSE ABG    Conn s  Inc    NASDAQ CONN    Kohl s Corp    NYSE KSS    DICK S Sporting Goods  Inc    NYSE DKS   and The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog 5 Stocks to Buy as Retail Sales Rebound in OctoberRetail sales staged a strong rebound in October following small declines over the last two months  Spending increased on building materials and motor vehicles  a result of rebuilding efforts  following the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Florence  Gas station sales also surged  indicating a jump in oil prices This effect will likely recede following the recent plunge in oil prices  But a robust labor market and fresh signs of wage growth will continue to support spending on categories that gained in October  This includes department stores and clothing outlets  This is why it makes good sense to invest in such retail stocks Consumer Spending Robust at Start of Q4According to the Department of Commerce  retail sales increased 0 8  in the month of October  exceeding the consensus estimate of 0 5   However  September s initial increase of 0 1  was revised downward to reflect a decline of 0 1   Excluding auto dealers and gas stations  retail sales increased 0 3  Year over year  retail sales increased 4 6   Further  core retail sales  which exclude autos  gasoline  building materials and food services  increased 0 3   This metric closely corresponds to the consumer spending component of GDP Overall  the report indicates that consumer spending was in good shape at the start of the fourth quarter  Despite concerns about trade deficit  this engine of expansion is likely to maintain strong growth for the economy going ahead A robust labor market  along with an unemployment rate of 3 7   the lowest since December 1969 is supporting consumer spending  Record low unemployment has also caused wages to grow at their fastest pace since early 2009 in October    Autos  Gasoline  Building Materials Lead GainsStrength in retail sales is a positive sign ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased 1 1  last month  Also  building material store sales increased 1   Both these increases were the fallout of the havoc caused by Hurricane Florence as residents replaced damaged vehicles and repaired homes Sales at gasoline stations jumped 3 5   reflecting the strength in oil prices prevailing during October  The current slump in crude oil indicates that this trend will likely fade away as prices at the pump decline Department stores registered a 1 3  increase in sales  while sales at clothing and accessories stores increased 0 5   Electronics and appliance stores reported a 0 7  rise in sales  Spending increased on hobbies  musical instruments  sporting goods and books by 0 5  However  sales at food services and drinking places declined 0 2   the likely fallout of Hurricane Michael which slammed into the Florida panhandle in mid October  Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores declined 0 7   weighed down by the slowdown in housing  following the recent spike in interest rates   Our ChoicesOctober s increase in retail sales indicates that consumer spending retained sufficient steam at the beginning of the fourth quarter  This in turn is being supported by record low unemployment  which also fueled a spurt in wage growth last month These trends are also likely to continue supporting the economy in the near term  This is why it makes sense to invest in retail stocks  especially the categories which have gained substantially last month  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Asbury Automotive Group  Inc  is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States Asbury Automotive carries a Zacks Rank  1

143857,365372,KSS,Here s Why Kohl s  KSS  Q3 Earnings  Sales Are Set To Grow,opinion,Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is slated to release third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 20  This department store chain has delivered average positive earnings surprise of nearly 10  in the trailing four quarters Kohl s Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see what s in store for the company this time around What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings currently stands at 96 cents  which has remained stable in the past 30 days and also compares favorably with 70 cents per share in the year ago quarter  Moreover  the consensus mark for revenues is  4 619 million  reflecting growth from  4 332 million in the year ago quarter Factors Impacting Kohl sKohl s has been gaining from its sturdy comparable store sales  comps  trend  which continued to fuel its performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2018  Incidentally  comps registered an increase of 3 1  during the second quarter  preceded by 3 6  rise in first quarter fiscal 2018  and 6 3  and 0 1  growth during the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  Comps in the second quarter gained from strength in both store and digital channels  while proprietary and national brands also portrayed sturdy performances  Additionally  the company s Men s and Women s apparel businesses along with Footwear witnessed strength In fact  Kohl s comps have been gaining from the company s Greatness Agenda strategic initiative  focus on boosting traffic and enhanced operational excellence  Notably  the Greatness Agenda initiative was commenced in first quarter fiscal 2014  designed to drive transactions per store and sales  Also  Kohl s has been strengthening its ties with retail giant Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   to drive traffic  In the long run  the company is expected to receive significant boost from this partnership  Further  Kohl s recent partnership with Aldi is also expected to strengthen its store base  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for comps growth in the second quarter is pegged at 1 6  Apart from these factors  and Kohl s regular innovation and brand building efforts  the company is poised to keep gaining from its e commerce business  which has improved significantly over the last few years  In order to improve its online offerings  Kohl s has been expanding its e commerce fulfillment centers  Additionally  the company focuses on strengthening its in store pickups  To this end  the company launched Buy Online Ship to Store  or BOSS  in July  which will be rolled out to more stores in the coming months  This initiative  which is expected to widen assortments for customers  is likely to boost store traffic  The company s sustained focus on technology improvements and omnichannel expansion is expected to continue driving online sales  Markedly  digital sales witnessed a mid teen increase during the second quarter  with almost half of it coming from mobile sales Will Increased Costs be Offset Well  Kohl s has been experiencing rising selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses for a while now  SG A expenses increased 4  during the second quarter of fiscal 2018  due to higher IT expenses  This was preceded by 3 7  rise during first quarter fiscal 2018  following increases of 7 3  and 1 4  during the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  For this fiscal  management now expects the increase in SG A expenses to be at the higher end of its previously guided range of 1 2  Nevertheless  we expect Kohl s robust revenue driving initiatives to counter these headwinds  Also  Kohl s efficient inventory management has been helping the company achieve cleaner inventory levels  The company has been achieving per store inventory reductions for ten straight quarters now  while the gross margin has been expanding for three quarters in a row  In second quarter fiscal 2018  the company s inventory per store decreased 8  that helped the gross margin expand 42 basis points as sustained inventory management efforts led to cleaner inventories and lower promotional markdowns Clearly  Kohl s is most likely to sustain its growth trend on the back of the aforementioned upsides  This gets reconfirmed by management s raised outlook for fiscal 2018  which also gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show that Kohl s is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter   For this to happen  the stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3

143859,365374,KSS,Kohl s Stock Could Catch A Lift Next Week,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  stock is slightly lower today  However  the retail stock could rally to new heights in the short term  if recent history is any indicator  Specifically  KSS has been one of the best stocks to own during Thanksgiving week  looking back 10 years  and next week s earnings release could be the catalyst to send the equity higher 
KSS has already gained more than 88  in the past year  with pullbacks contained by its 120 day and 160 day moving average  The shares touched a record peak of  83 28 earlier this week  but have since pulled back to trade around  79 60 

As alluded to earlier  Kohl s stock has been higher the week of Thanksgiving 90  of the time in the past decade  with the equity averaging a gain of 3 45   per data from Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  The retailer also has a date in the earnings confessional next week  expected to report third quarter earnings before the open on Tuesday  Nov  20 
The equity moved higher the day of its August earnings report  and also gained after earnings one year ago  Looking back eight quarters  KSS has moved an average of 6 6  the day after earnings  regardless of direction  A 6 6  swing to the upside from current levels would put Kohl s stock just south of  85  and into new high territory 
Meanwhile  Cowen analysts also feel KSS is a  buy  before the holiday shopping season  Specifically  the brokerage firm on Tuesday named Kohl s one of the best positioned retailers heading into Black Friday  saying it is  set up well to execute on internal strategies  and should also benefit significantly from  recent dislocation from closed competitors   Plus  the analyst said Kohl s is among the best positioned to capitalize on strong mobile growth this year 
However  despite the stock s impressive performance over the past year  there s still plenty of room on the bullish bandwagon  In fact  10 of 17 analysts following KSS maintain icy  hold  or  strong sell  ratings  leaving the door open for potential upgrades to push the shares even higher 
A short squeeze could also boost Kohl s stock  should the company impress after earnings  Short interest represents more than 17  of the equity s total available float  and would take nearly two weeks to buy back  at KSS  average pace of trading 
Finally  an unwinding of pessimism in the options pits could also translate into a boon for the shares  Data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  shows traders have bought to open nearly two KSS puts for every call in the past two weeks  The resulting 10 day put call volume ratio of 1 96 is in the 96th percentile of its annual range  suggesting option buyers are picking up bearish bets over bullish at a much faster pace than usual ",2018-11-15,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kohls-stock-could-catch-a-lift-next-week-200359397,200359397
143860,365375,KSS,5 Stocks To Buy As Retail Sales Rebound In October ,opinion,Retail sales staged a strong rebound in October following small declines over the last two months  Spending increased on building materials and motor vehicles  a result of rebuilding efforts  following the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Florence  Gas station sales also surged  indicating a jump in oil prices This effect will likely recede following the recent plunge in oil prices  But a robust labor market and fresh signs of wage growth will continue to support spending on categories that gained in October  This includes department stores and clothing outlets  This is why it makes good sense to invest in such retail stocks Consumer Spending Robust at Start of Q4According to the Department of Commerce  retail sales increased 0 8  in the month of October  exceeding the consensus estimate of 0 5   However  September s initial increase of 0 1  was revised downward to reflect a decline of 0 1   Excluding auto dealers and gas stations  retail sales increased 0 3  Year over year  retail sales increased 4 6   Further  core retail sales  which exclude autos  gasoline  building materials and food services  increased 0 3   This metric closely corresponds to the consumer spending component of GDP Overall  the report indicates that consumer spending was in good shape at the start of the fourth quarter  Despite concerns about trade deficit  this engine of expansion is likely to maintain strong growth for the economy going ahead A robust labor market  along with an unemployment rate of 3 7   the lowest since December 1969 is supporting consumer spending  Record low unemployment has also caused wages to grow at their fastest pace since early 2009 in October    Autos  Gasoline  Building Materials Lead GainsStrength in retail sales is a positive sign ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers increased 1 1  last month  Also  building material store sales increased 1   Both these increases were the fallout of the havoc caused by Hurricane Florence as residents replaced damaged vehicles and repaired homes Sales at gasoline stations jumped 3 5   reflecting the strength in oil prices prevailing during October  The current slump in crude oil indicates that this trend will likely fade away as prices at the pump decline Department stores registered a 1 3  increase in sales  while sales at clothing and accessories stores increased 0 5   Electronics and appliance stores reported a 0 7  rise in sales  Spending increased on hobbies  musical instruments  sporting goods and books by 0 5  However  sales at food services and drinking places declined 0 2   the likely fallout of Hurricane Michael which slammed into the Florida panhandle in mid October  Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores declined 0 7   weighed down by the slowdown in housing  following the recent spike in interest rates   Our ChoicesOctober s increase in retail sales indicates that consumer spending retained sufficient steam at the beginning of the fourth quarter  This in turn is being supported by record low unemployment  which also fueled a spurt in wage growth last month These trends are also likely to continue supporting the economy in the near term  This is why it makes sense to invest in retail stocks  especially the categories which have gained substantially last month  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style

143882,365397,KSS,Why Kohl s  KSS  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Kohl s  KSS   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this department store operator has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 18 64   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Kohl s came out with earnings of  1 76 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 65 per share  representing a surprise of 6 67   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 49 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 64 per share  delivering a surprise of 30 61  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Kohl s  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Kohl s has an Earnings ESP of  0 23  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 20  2018 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-11-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-kohls-kss-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200358248,200358248
143883,365398,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Kohl s  KSS   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Kohl s currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for KSS that show why this department store operator shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For KSS  shares are up 6 59  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Regional Department Stores industry is up 7 05  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 12 92  compares favorably with the industry s 7 16  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Kohl s have increased 2 41  over the past quarter  and have gained 96 09  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  3 26  and 7 61   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to KSS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  KSS is currently averaging 3 360 994 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with KSS 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost KSS s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 45 to  5 48 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that KSS is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Kohl s on your short list ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kohls-kss-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200358802,200358802
143884,365399,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Kohl s  KSS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  37 1  
Revenues are expected to be  4 62 billion  up 6 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 67  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kohl s 
For Kohl s  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kohl s will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kohl s would post earnings of  1 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 76  delivering a surprise of  6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kohl s doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kohls-kss-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200358766,200358766

143896,365411,KSS,With The Retail Sector Hot  Check Out These Payment Processors,opinion,"Retail stocks have been the best market performers so far in 2018  handily outpacing the S P 500   The industry is up 20  year to date versus 6  for the S P and some of the best performers  like Amazon    Macy s  and Kohl s  are up even more 
In a blockbuster Q1 earnings season  one retail stock after another reported better than expected revenues in an environment of low unemployment and Consumer Confidence at an 18 month high 
Most of those increased sales have one thing in common   electronic payment  Approximately 67  of in person sales and virtually 100  of online transactions are made with a credit or debit card  Consumers increasingly prefer the convenience and security of electronic transactions for large purchases all the way down to a cup of coffee 
In the shift toward an essentially cashless economy  one big winner is the company who process electronic payments and transfers 
Priceless Growth
Mastercard  has been offering credit card processing services for issuing banks since 1966   way back when credit card transactions happened on those sliding carbon copy machines   Originally organized as a cooperative of issuing banks  Mastercard went public in 2006 as an independent transaction processor 
Mastercard now has gross sales of  15 billion a year and reported record results in Q1 with gross sales of  3 6B and earnings of  1 50 share  increases of 31  and 49  respectively over the same quarter in 2017  It was the 17th quarter in a row that Mastercard exceeded the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate and 16 subsequent upward revisions now have the consensus for full year 2018 at  6 31 share  an increase of 37  over 2017   MA is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Payment Solutions for Enterprise
Wex Inc  provides electronic payment solutions for businesses in three general areas  Fleet Services  Employee Travel and Healthcare  WEX partners with both the customers who utilize the company s innovative virtual payment solutions and the vendors who provide the goods and services being purchased  using economies of scale to reduce transaction costs 
WEX provides detailed information  insights and control over spending  allowing customers to manage costs and reduce paperwork 
WEX has also invested in distributed ledger technology especially as it relates to crypto currencies  Though Bitcoin and other cryptos are not yet widely used for everyday transactions  if they gain favor in the future  WEX will be ready to process payments   and likey one of the leaders in the iindustry 
Thanks to steadily growing revenues and earnings  WEX shares have risen 36  in 2018  WEX is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   
Cash is not Dead
Although an increasing amount of payments are performed electronically  cash is not dead yet  as many consumers and merchants continue to prefer currency for transactions  Especially when traveling  millions of customers rely on ATM machines for ready cash and operators get paid a fee on every withdrawal 
Cardtronics Plc  is the world s largest operator of ATMs  with 230 000 machines in 10 countries processing over 2 6 billion transactions per year  Their customers include large financial institutions like Citigroup   TD  and Santander  MC SAN   as well as merchants including Target  Kroger  NYSE KR   and Walgreens  
With a history of positive earnings surprises  CATM posted a big earnings beat in Q1  reporting  0 46 share versus estimates of  0 26 share 
Cardtronics is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

143898,365413,KSS,Buy The Dip On Kohl s Stock  Plus  Walmart Gears Up For Earnings,opinion,"While a poorly received earnings report from Macy s  NYSE M  has several retailer stocks in the red today  the sector has been on fire recently  The SPDR S P Retail ETF  NYSE XRT  is fresh off a record high of  51 94 yesterday  and retail sales for July exceeded estimates  In addition  the National Retail Federation  NRF  upped its outlook for retail sales growth in 2018  citing higher wages and tax reform as drivers heading into the holiday season  Against this backdrop  Walmart  NYSE WMT  is on our radar ahead of earnings  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE NYSE KSS  stock could be flashing  buy  
Walmart Looking to Buck Recent Post Earnings Trend
Walmart will report second quarter earnings before the open tomorrow  Looking at Walmart s earnings history  the stock has closed higher the day after the company reported in four of the last eight quarters  but more recently dropped 1 9  after its May release  and fell 10 2  after earnings in February  Looking back eight quarters  the shares have moved 4 5  the day after earnings  on average  regardless of direction  This time around  however  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 6 3  move for Thursday trading 
On the charts  WMT stock is down 0 9  to trade at  89 97  Shares of the blue chip retailer have trended higher since grazing the  82 level in May  up roughly 10  in that time frame  However  the stock is staring up at its 200 day moving average  and the round number  90 level has acted as a speed bump since March 

Options traders appear to be betting on a breakout  picking up WMT calls at a rapid fire rate ahead of earnings  Data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  shows a 10 day call put volume ratio of 3 87  Not only does this indicate calls bought to open have nearly quadrupled puts in the past 10 days  but it ranks 3 percentage points from an annual high  indicating a much healthier than usual appetite for bullish bets over bearish in the past two weeks 
Kohl s Stock Flashing Bullish Signal
Looking at Kohl s    which reports earnings next Tuesday  Aug  21    the stock is down 5  today at  74 60  dragged lower by Macy s quarterly report  Prior to today s pullback  KSS was within a chip shot of its June 12 record high of  79 92  Overall  the equity has nearly doubled in the past 12 months  and it might be time to buy today s dip 

Even with earnings on the horizon  the equity s Schaeffer s Volatility Index  SVI     a measure of front month  at the money implied volatility  ATM IV     currently stands at just 44   This SVI arrives in the 17th percentile of its annual range  indicating that speculative players have priced in lower volatility expectations just 17  of the time in the past year 
This combination of a high stock price and low IV has had bullish implications for KSS in the past  according to Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  Since 2008  there have been three occasions where KSS has been trading within 2  of its annual high while at the same time its SVI was in the 20th annual percentile or lower  Following those signals  the security was up 14 8  one month later  on average  and was higher all three times  From the stock s current perch  a similar surge would place KSS above  85 
Should Kohl s report strong earnings next week  shorts could soon be squeezed  Short interest fell 1 7  in the most recent reporting period  yet the 26 58 million shares still sold short represent 16  of KSS  total available float  and more than 11 days of pent up buying power  at the stock s average pace of trading 
Furthermore  an unwinding of pessimism could also occur in the options pits  ISE CBOE PHLX data shows KSS with a 10 day put call volume ratio of 2 05  which ranks in the 99th percentile of its annual range  In other words  speculators have been buying Kohl s puts over calls at a much faster than usual pace ",2018-08-16,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buy-the-dip-on-kohls-stock-plus-walmart-gears-up-for-earnings-200338869,200338869

reported quarter  the company reported an earnings beat of 25   Further  this Florida based company has an impressive earnings surprise history  with average beat of 9 8  How are Estimates Faring The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 12 cents  reflecting a decline of 14 3  from the year ago quarter  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone down by a penny in the past 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is  2 858 million  up 9 1  from  2 620 million recorded in the year ago period Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderOffice Depot is exposed to headwinds stemming from soft demand for office products due to technological advancements  Smartphones  tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper based office supplies  Moreover  higher marketing  advertising and other growth related investments may hurt margins Further  rise in cost of goods sold and occupancy costs as well as increased SG A and interest expenses have been a threat to the company s bottom line for a while now  We note that earnings per share had declined 50  and 17  in the first and second quarter of 2018  respectively  Also  dismal comparable store sales run across the company s Retail division for the past few quarters and stiff competition from office supply retailers are concerns Such downsides led the stock to plunge 10 1  in the past month  against the  s growth of 3 2  However  the company has undertaken initiatives such as strategic review of business operating model  growth prospects and cost structure that have helped it get back on track  Moreover  the company is closing underperforming stores  reducing exposure to higher dollar value inventory items  shuttering non critical distribution facilities  concentrating on e commerce platforms and focusing on providing innovative products and services Office Depot s initiative of buy online and pick up in store is also gaining traction  The company  by increasing its penetration into adjacent categories and enhancing share of wallet with existing customers  intends to boost sales in the contract channel  It has been improving in store shopping experience  and expanding into the cleaning and breakroom category  copy   print services and furniture Management is making incremental investments to transform the business into a product and services driven enterprise  Service revenues now represent approximately 14  of the total sales  Management intends to increase revenue contribution from services to approximately 20  of total sales in the next two years To widen its domain of offerings  Office Depot acquired CompuCom Systems that is helping it to acclimatize to the fast changing retail landscape along with providing enterprise level tech services and products to customers  The company also signed a channel partner agreement with MicroCorp  a premier value added distributor of telecom and cloud solutions  It is also incorporating Tech Zone services desk across its stores The company is on track with its cost containment efforts  In doing so  Office Depot is employing a more efficient customer coverage model  and focusing on lowering indirect procurement costs and general and administrative expenses  The company is also gaining from its U S  retail store optimization plan  Management had earlier informed that these endeavors would result in benefits of more than  250 million by the end of 2018  Cost savings along with synergy benefits from the OfficeMax integration in excess of  750 million would amount to total annual savings of approximately  1 billion Office Depot  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Office Depot

143903,365418,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Kohl s in Focus
Kohl s  KSS  is headquartered in Menomonee Falls  and is in the Retail Wholesale sector  The stock has seen a price change of 47 96  since the start of the year  The department store operator is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 61 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 04   This compares to the Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s yield of 0 59  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 9  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 44 is up 10 9  from last year  Kohl s has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12 17   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Kohl s s current payout ratio is 49   This means it paid out 49  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for KSS for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is  5 47 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 30 55  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that KSS is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kohls-kss-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200356218,200356218

143925,365440,KSS,ETFs   Stocks To Win Lose On SCOTUS Sales Tax Decision ,opinion,"The online retail stocks were hit hard on Jun 21  2018 on the ruling of the supreme court of the United States  SCOTUS  on sales tax  The 5 4 ruling permits states to collect sales taxes from online and   The latest decision reverses a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that prohibited the practice 
Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that the reason for the upturn in the previous ruling was the radical change in online retail industry  The 1992 ruling was mainly concerned about the mail order business worth  
But now the online retail industry has ballooned    Last year  e commerce retail sales alone were estimated at  453 5 billion   he mentioned  This along with traditional remote sellers amounted to more than half a trillion dollars 
Below we highlight a few ETF and stock winners and losers following the Supreme tax ruling 
Brick and Mortar Retailers  A Clear Winner 
Brick and Mortar retailers became the most expected winners  Companies like Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT    up 0 7   and Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS    up 1 14   thus gained on Jun 21  The broader retail ETF VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   added about 0 24  on that day 
Online Retailers  An Obvious Loser  
Online retail ETFs like Amplify Online Retail ETF   down 1 4   and ProShares Long Online Short Stores ETF   down 2 3   slid on Jun 21  to reflect the Supreme Court ruling 
Amazon  A Surprising Long Term Winner
Though online retail behemoth Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   lost more than 1 1  on Jun 21  experts do not foresee the company to suffer from the ruling  This is because  Amazon already collects sales tax on the products it sells directly   Since this makes up about half of all units sold on its site  the court ruling should not have much impact on Amazon 
However  the rest of the products are sold by third party merchants on Amazon s marketplace and  the ruling    per a law professor at the University of Arizona  as quoted on CNBC  Even  believes that whether higher taxes on those smaller retailers  goods will at all affect Amazon s overall revenues is still unclear 
Moreover  companies such as Amazon and eBay Inc    NASDAQ EBAY    down 3 25  on Jun 21  have wide international exposure  which should cushion them from U S  State taxes  So  investors can have faith on Amazon heavy ETFs like Consumer Discret Sel Sect SPDR ETF   V XLY    read    
Small Online Retailers Likely to be Hard Hit
Smaller online retailers with concentrated exposure to the U S  market are likely to be knocked down the most  Notably  online retailer Overstock com Inc    NASDAQ OSTK   shed a solid 7 2  on Jun 21  The company  mainly from the United States 
Consumers May Feel the Pinch 
Overall  if taxes are hiked  companies may choose to pass that burden on to consumers  So  consumers  shopping bills could see a jump ahead  iShares US Consumer Services ETF  should thus be on investors  radar

143942,365457,KSS,Job growth slows  but wages rebound strongly,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employment increased less than expected in December but a rebound in wages pointed to sustained labor market momentum that sets up the economy for stronger growth and further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year 
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 156 000 jobs last month  the Labor Department said on Friday  The gains  however  are more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the work age population  Employers hired 19 000 more workers than previously reported in October and November 
 Job creation and overall labor market conditions remain solid  With the potential for stronger fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and tax cuts  job creation appears likely to remain on a solid footing in 2017   said Jim Baird  chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo  Michigan 
The economy created 2 16 million jobs in 2016  Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents or 0 4 percent in December after slipping 0 1 percent in November  That pushed the year on year increase in earnings to 2 9 percent  the largest gain since June 2009  from 2 5 percent in November 
While the unemployment rate ticked up to 4 7 percent from a nine year low of 4 6 percent in November  that was because more people entered the labor force  a sign of confidence in the labor market  Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 178 000 jobs last month 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government bonds fell  Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher 
Other data on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 6 8 percent to  45 2 billion in November as imports rose to their highest level in more than a year on higher oil prices 
The employment report added to data ranging from housing to manufacturing and auto sales in suggesting that President elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy from the Obama administration  The labor market momentum is likely to be sustained amid rising business and consumer confidence 
Trump  who takes over from President Barack Obama on Jan  20  has pledged to increase spending on the country s aging infrastructure  cut taxes and relax regulations  These measures are expected to boost growth this year 
But the proposed expansionary fiscal policy stance could increase the budget deficit  That  together with faster economic growth and a labor market that is expected to hit full employment this year could raise concerns about the Fed falling behind the curve on interest rate increases 
Last month s wage growth left it just shy of the 3 0 percent to 3 5 percent range that economists say is needed to lift inflation to the Fed s 2 0 percent target 
 This is coming well before any fiscal stimulus hits  It plays to the idea that the Fed may already be behind the curve  not least because the impetus from lower oil prices has turned more inflationary as well   said Alan Ruskin  FX Research head at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  in New York 
The U S  central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0 50 percent to 0 75 percent  The Fed forecast three rate hikes this year 
FACTORY JOBS INCREASE
A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell one tenth to a more than 8 1 2 year low of 9 2 percent 
Employment growth in 2016 averaged 180 000 jobs per month  down from an average gain of 229 000 per month in 2015  The slowdown in job growth is consistent with a labor market that is near full employment 
There has been an increase in employers saying they cannot fill vacant positions because they cannot find qualified workers  The skills shortage has been prominent in the construction industry 
 The pool is all but drained especially for skilled workers  We can t bring factory jobs back because there s no one out there to run them   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at
MUFG Union Bank in New York 
The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  rose one tenth of percentage point to 62 7 percent in December 
The participation rate remains near multi decade lows  Some of the decline reflects demographic changes 
December s job gains were broad  with manufacturing payrolls rising 17 000 after declining for four straight months  Construction payrolls fell 3 000 in December after three consecutive months of increases 
Retail sector employment rose 6 300 after increasing 19 500 in November  Department store giants Macy s  N M  and Kohl s Corp  N KSS  this week reported a drop in holiday sales  Macy s said it planned to cut 10 000 jobs beginning this year

143948,365463,KSS,A Look At Amazon s Physical Retail   Subscription Growth,opinion,"Shares of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    surged over 4  on Friday to touch a brand new all time high one day after the e commerce powerhouse posted strong first quarter results  But while much attention has been paid to Amazon s massive bottom line beat and continued online sales expansion  let s dive into the company s physical retail growth along with its booming subscriber business 
Amazon posted adjusted Q1 earnings of  3 27 per share  which crushed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 per share  Meanwhile  the company s overall first quarter revenues surged 43  to  51 04 billion  This also beat our  50 17 billion consensus estimate 
Investors should note that Amazon Web Services  or AWS  soared 49  from the year ago period to  5 44 billion   Amazon also posted online sales of  26 94 billion and third party seller revenues of  9 27 billion 
With that said  two other important Amazon growth areas deserve some more attention 
Physical Stores 
The company reported first quarter physical stores sales of  4 26 billion  This is only the third period that Amazon reported such revenues  but its sales soared from  1 28 billion in the third quarter of 2017 
Amazon bought Whole Foods almost a year ago for  13 4 billion  marking the biggest move in the company s effort to expand its physical retail presence  And Whole Foods revenues  from its 479 stores  account for a large portion of these physical stores sales  But Amazon has also expanded its retail footprint in other ways 
Amazon  bookstore in November 2015  The company now has 15 total Amazon Books locations throughout the U S   from California to New York  Amazon plans to open three more new locations soon 
The e commerce giant also has an array of  throughout the country  Amazon sets up these temporary shops in malls  Whole Foods  and Kohl s   NYSE KSS   stores in order to sell different Amazon products  including Kindle and Echo devices 
Amazon s physical retail revenue also included the company s unique  no checkout Amazon  store in Seattle  Cleary  Amazon is slowly expanding its brick and mortar presence  with the nascent unit accounting for roughly 8 3  of total first quarter revenue 
Subscription Services
Moving on  Amazon s subscription services unit is made up primarily of annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships  audiobook and digital music fees  as well as all other non AWS subscriptions services  Just last week  CEO Jeff Bezos publicly revealed for the first time that its Prime program currently boasts 100 million paying members worldwide 
Amazon s quarterly subscription revenues surged 60  from  1 94 billion in the year ago period to hit  3 10 billion  The big climb was larger than both AWS and online sales  and can be attributed to Amazon Prime s expansion 
Subscription Services are also set to get a boost after Amazon  a planned rate hike on its first quarter earnings call that will see its yearly Prime membership fees jump from  99 to  119  starting on May 11 
Amazon s latest rate hike comes only a few months after it raised Prime s monthly membership from  10 99 per month to  12 99 per month

Retail earnings will continue to trickle in this week  with department store chain Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  scheduled to report its first quarter results before the market opens Tuesday  KSS has averaged a next day move of 6 9  over the past eight quarters  yet this time around  the options market is pricing in a much larger next day move of 11 6   regardless of direction  based on implied volatility data 
Heading into the event  options volume has picked up today  with roughly 5 000 calls and 5 300 puts crossing the tape    double the average intraday rate  KSS  weekly 5 25 69 50 strike call is garnering notable attention  with new positions being opened  If these calls are being bought  traders are wagering on post earnings upside from KSS shares through the end of this week  when the contracts expire  Meanwhile  the January 2020 50 strike put is most popular  and it looks like one trader may have sold the puts to open to bet on a long term floor for Kohl s shares

143964,365479,KSS,U S  retail sales  industrial output data point to slowing growth,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  retail sales barely rose in November and industrial production recorded its biggest drop in eight months  suggesting some loss of momentum in economic growth in the fourth quarter  The weak retail sales and industrial output readings reported on Wednesday did not deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates 25 basis points to between 0 50 percent and 0 75 percent  The Fed signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017  against the backdrop of steadily rising inflation and a tightening labor market  Other data showed producer prices notching their largest increase in five months in November amid a jump in the cost of services  The moderation in retail sales came after two straight months of strong gains  With incomes rising  household wealth at record highs and robust consumer sentiment  the cool off in retail sales is likely to be temporary   Consumer spending remains the main engine of growth for the economy   said Harm Bandholz  chief U S  economist at UniCredit Research in New York   Solid employment growth and accelerating wage gains will continue to support household spending  This dynamic allowed the Fed to raise rates today and gave them confidence to signal further rate hikes next year    Retail sales edged up 0 1 percent last month as households cut back on motor vehicle purchases after rising 0 6 percent in October  the Commerce Department said  Sales were up 3 8 percent from a year ago  Excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services  retail sales also nudged up 0 1 percent last month after gaining 0 6 percent in October  These so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product  Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0 3 percent and core sales also gaining 0 3 percent last month  In another report  the Fed said industrial production fell 0 4 percent last month  pulled down by a 4 4 percent drop in utilities output as warmer than normal temperatures cut demand for heating  The drop in industrial production was the largest since March   Manufacturing production slipped 0 1 percent  held back by a 2 3 percent drop in motor vehicle output  Excluding autos  manufacturing output rose 0 2 percent  Mining production surged 1 1 percent amid rising oil and gas well drilling as the drag from last year s collapse in oil prices fades  Nevertheless  the soft retail sales and industrial production  together with a another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories recording their biggest drop in 11 months in October  implied the economy was slowing in the fourth quarter after growing at a brisk 3 2 percent annualized rate in the July September period  The Atlanta Fed trimmed its fourth quarter GDP growth estimate by two tenths of a percentage to a 2 4 percent rate after the data   The dollar reversed losses against a basket of currencies  rallying to a near 14 year high after the Fed suggested it would raise borrowing costs three times next year   Prices for U S  government bonds fell  with yields on two year Treasury  US2YT RR  notes rising to their highest level since August 2009  Stocks on Wall Street ended lower   The U S  central bank hiked its overnight benchmark interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade   The Fed s anticipated faster pace of rate increases in 2017  is likely in response to president elect Donald Trump s planned expansionary fiscal policy agenda aimed at boosting growth through infrastructure spending and tax cuts  INFLATION PERKING UP A third report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index for final demand increased 0 4 percent last month  the largest gain since June  after being unchanged in October   In the 12 months through November  the PPI rose 1 3 percent  the biggest gain in two years  The PPI rose 0 8 percent in the 12 months through October  A 0 5 percent increase in the cost of services accounted for more than 80 percent of the rise in the final demand PPI last month  The increase  which followed a 0 3 percent decline in October  was the largest since January  With producer prices pushing higher  overall inflation is expected to steadily move toward the Fed s 2 percent target   The prospects of strengthening demand point to upward inflation pressures in 2017   said Sam Bullard  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina  Last month s weak retail sales figures came despite consumer confidence rising to cycle highs  leaving some economists to expect that the numbers would revised higher when the government releases December s report in January  Sales at clothing stores were flat last month  Department stores like Macy s  N M  and Kohl s  N KSS  are facing intense competition from online retailers such as Amazon  O AMZN   which have snatched a large chunk of the market share   But online retail sales rose marginally last month  There were solid gains in sales at furniture  food and beverage  as well as building material stores  Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars last month  
 We are a bit skeptical of this morning s numbers   said Michelle Girard  chief economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford  Connecticut   Given anecdotal evidence and the rise in consumer confidence  we suspect the November figures could get revised higher or will be followed by a much improved performance  ",2016-12-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s-retail-sales-cool-in-november-after-strong-gains-447716,447716

Gold likely gained support at  1 337 50  the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at  1 391 40  the high from March 14  2014 
The dollar stayed mostly unchanged in Thursday s session  despite upbeat data concerning weekly jobless claims  which came on the heels of a robust monthly employment report for July  Last week  initial jobless claims in the U S  fell by 1 000 to 266 000  lingering near historic lows  The four week moving average  meanwhile  inched up by 3 500 to 262 750  demonstrating little change from recent reports 
Investors also reacted to optimistic quarterly results from Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  on Thursday ahead of the release of monthly retail sales data by the U S  Census Bureau  Shares in  Macy s soared as much as 15   after the major department store reported a lower than expected decline in same store sales in the second quarter and outlined a plan to close 100 stores in a massive turnaround initiative  On Friday  the Census Bureau is expected to report an increase of 0 4  in retail sales last month  following a gain of 0 6  in June  Additionally  the University of Michigan could report a slight uptick in consumer sentiment in July in the wake of a sharp decline of 3 5 points a month earlier

The Federal Reserve continues to closely monitor incoming economic data  as it weighs a decision in September on the timing of its next interest rate hike  Last month  the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  reiterated that it will tighten monetary policy gradually if the economy demonstrates improvement in the coming months 
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for Gold  which struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in rising rate environments

holiday season  Higher consumer confidence  record low jobless rate and solid wage growth are expected to boost retail sales throughout the year  while the Republican tax cut will help retailers save a whopping  175 billion  per the National Retail Federation  NRF   This extra cash can be used to buy back shares  pay dividends  and execute mergers and acquisitions With the overall trend in the retail industry remaining promising  investors should double down on the hottest retailers right away Efforts to Please Online   Instore CustomersWalmart s online sales rose 23  in the final quarter of 2017  lagging the previous quarter s 50  rise  In fact  sales jumped 60  in the two periods prior to that  The decline in growth rattled investors as it implied the company is not in a position to

the U S  Census Bureau Meanwhile  January retail sales fell unexpectedly  After all  U S  retail sales dropped 0 3  last month largely due to a decline in motor vehicle  gasoline  food services  and home appliances sales  But  the core retail sales that show the GDP s consumer spending segment remained unchanged  which shows that retail sales remained nearly as good as the holiday season s strong showing  read more    NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay further added that  with consumer confidence high  unemployment low and wages growing  there is every reason to believe that retail sales will be robust throughout the year  Catalysts Behind the SurgeThe University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index increased from 95 7 in January to 99 9 in February  This was the highest recorded since 2004 and the second highest since the 13 year high hit in October 2017  This reading exceeded most economists  expectations of 95 5 to 95 7  read more    The labor market  in the meantime  has come a

144022,365537,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Q4 Earnings   Sales Likely To Rise  Here s Why,opinion,Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is slated to release fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1  While the company reported a negative earnings surprise in the last quarter  the departmental store retailer has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 12 5  in the trailing four quarters  We expect the company to continue gaining from its robust sales driving efforts  which also helped the company to put up solid holiday sales numbers  which was revealed last month Let s delve deeper into these factors  which appear to be major growth drivers for Kohl s   also giving out positive signals for the upcoming results Factors Driving the QuarterKohl s has been gaining from its various sales driving initiatives  which also helped it witness its first quarterly comparable store sales  comps  growth in a long time  when it reported third quarter fiscal 2017 results  Among its various efforts  alliance with online giant Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   seems to be yielding results for Kohl s  Incidentally  the company started accepting returns from Amazon s customers on select products  This move followed Kohl s decision to sell Amazon devices  accessories and smart home devices across 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago   Additionally  the company is gaining from enhanced focus on prominent brands such as Nike   NYSE NKE   and Adidas   OTC ADDYY    Further  Kohl s has been regularly introducing brands to keep inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to stores and website Kohl s Corporation Price and EPS Surprise     Also  Kohl s gained significant market share in active apparel and footwear up until the third quarter  and expects the trend to continue  based on assortment improvements  Such efforts to expand store traffic and sales are reflected in the company s share price performance  Kohl s shares have gained 60 1  in a year  compared with the   increase of 9 9  Holiday Results Hint at a Strong Q4Fueled by these factors  Kohl s revealed that both  comparable store sales  comps  and total sales of the company advanced 6 9  year over year  for the combined November and December 2017 period  Notably  this marks a significant improvement from a 2 1  and 2 7  respective drop in comps and total sales witnessed in the 2016 holiday season  Notably  Kohl s performance remained sturdy throughout November and December  backed by positive comps across all businesses and regions  This  in turn was fueled by Kohl s robust strategies  which helped it attract strong traffic and record solid digital sales during the season Final Thoughts   Q4 ExpectationsWe believe that sustained focus on technology improvements and omni channel expansion is likely to fuel further growth at Kohl s  In fact  the department store retailer s better than expected holiday performance and optimistic anticipations for January stimulated management to raise its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook  Nonetheless  management stated that the updated guidance doesn t include any impact from the latest tax reforms  which is likely to have a favorable effect on the company s effective tax rate Apart from this  the company has also been undertaking several initiatives to reduce its inventory  in order to boost its profits  During third quarter fiscal 2017  the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result  inventory per store decreased 2   while units per store were 4  lower  Lower inventory levels led to improvement in merchandise margins  and the company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid single digits for fiscal 2017  Clearly  all these factors bode well for the fourth quarter The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at  1 77  which shows a nearly 23  surge from  1 44 recorded in the year ago period  The estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days  Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  6 743 million  up 8 7  from the year ago quarter What the Zacks Model UnveilsHowever  our proven model doesn t show that Kohl s is likely to beat bottom line estimates this quarter  For this to happen  a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our While Kohl s sports a Zacks Rank  1  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

144025,365540,KSS,Here s Why Kohl s  KSS  Appears To Be A Solid Value Stock,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Kohl s has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 91  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 02  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Kohl s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 12 19 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail   Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 11  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Kohl s has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 01  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Kohl s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Kohl s has a P S ratio of about 0 58  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 37 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from the P S aspect as well  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Kohl s currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Kohl s a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Kohl s might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives KSS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has surged 26 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has soared 28 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Kohl s Corporation Price and Consensus    Thanks to this bullish trend  the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKohl s is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  this Zacks Rank  1 stock possesses a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among top 1  of more than 250 industries  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Breaking News  Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed  700 billion   more than

144031,365546,KSS,U S  labor market firming  inflation remains benign,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week  pointing to sustained labor market strength in early August that could help spur faster economic growth  Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in import prices in July as a drop in petroleum prices was offset by gains in the cost of other goods  However  renewed dollar strength is expected to curb underlying inflation in the coming months   The data remain consistent with a still strong trend in employment growth  which means the backdrop for consumer spending remains favorable   said Jim O Sullivan  chief U S  economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla  New York   Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1 000 to a seasonally adjusted 266 000 for the week ended Aug  6  the Labor Department said  Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2 000 fewer applications received than previously reported  Claims have now been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a strong labor market  for 75 straight weeks  the longest streak since 1973 when the labor force was smaller   The four week average of claims  considered to be a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  rose 3 000 to 262 750 last week   With the labor market perceived to be either at or approaching full employment  there is probably little room for further declines in claims  A report on Wednesday showed layoffs fell to a near two year low in June  The upbeat claims report and better than expected financial results from retailers Kohl  N KSS  and Macy s  N M  boosted U S  stocks  Prices for U S  government debt fell  while the dollar  DXY  was largely changed against a basket of currencies  TAME INFLATION  In a separate report  the Labor Department said import prices edged up 0 1 percent last month after increasing 0 6 percent in June  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices falling 0 3 percent in July  In the 12 months through July  import prices fell 3 7 percent  the smallest decrease since November 2014  after declining 4 7 percent in the 12 months through June  Import prices excluding petroleum increased 0 5 percent  the largest gain since April 2011  after dropping 0 3 percent in June  Last month s increase in import prices came despite a 0 6 percent rise in the dollar against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners in July  The dollar lost some steam early in the year  Oil prices  which had started to rise toward  50 per barrel  fell in July and are now below  45 per barrel   The combination of dollar strength and cheap oil will likely continue to dampen imported inflation pressures and keepoverall inflation below the Federal Reserve s 2 percent target  Persistently low inflation suggests the U S  central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near term  even as the labor market approaches full employment   Although the pass through of import prices to consumer price inflation is small  given the large share of spending on services  the weakness in import prices remains an additional hurdle for the Fed in reaching its inflation goal   said Sam Bullard  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina  The robust labor market is boosting consumer spending and putting a floor under the economy after an inventory correction and lower oil prices restricted GDP growth to an average 1 0 percent annualized rate in the last three quarters

144049,365564,KSS,4 Top Stocks To Buy As Fears Of Recession Subside,opinion,With erratic movements of major market indices last week  many analysts found it quite tricky to spot the prime factor behind the extreme volatility  Although The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 4  on Feb 9 after a wild week  fears of a downturn in the near future gripped the market However  chances of a recession are negligible given record low unemployment levels and better than expected job additions  Favorable fourth quarter earnings also acted as an antidote Markets Bled Last WeekOn average  the Dow moved more than 1 000 points every day through the week  The market saw the index alter directions roughly 53 times  per The Wall Street Journal  Moreover  the weekly decline of 5 2  for the index was the steepest in more than two years The encouraging wage growth data convinced investors of a probable spike in inflation  which might lead the central bank to raise interest rates sooner than expected  Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  private sector workers witnessed 2 9  year over year wage growth in January  the highest since June 2009  The fear of impending inflation led the 10  drop in Dow from the record high mark of Jan 26   Chances of Recession Negligible Most analysts believe that the market was overdue for a correction and major indices might even plunge further  but that will not lead to a recession anytime soon  The signs of recession are normally reflected in indicators like GDP and employment data  and these parameters show no signs of a recession GDP Data Solid  The nation s GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the final three months of 2017  following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3   per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  In fact  this marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009 Notably  in the first quarter of this year  GDP might jump   per the latest estimate of Atlanta Fed Significant Job Addition   Low Unemployment  Per the US Labor Department report  200 000 new non farm payroll jobs were created in January  beating market expectations  According to a survey by Reuters  most economists were expecting an addition of 180 000 U S  jobs Also  the jobless rate remained at an ultra low level of 4 1   and workers  hourly wages increased 2 9  year over year in January 2017 Favorable Q4 Earnings Dispel FearsWe are almost at the tail end of the Q4 earnings season  with 341 S P 500 members having reported their numbers and 159 yet to report  Per the latest   total earnings for all S P 500 companies will be up 14 1  from the same period last year on 8 2  higher revenues  The expected year over year earnings growth for the fourth quarter is way higher than the 6 7   11 2  and 13 5  growth rates for 3Q17  2Q17 and 1Q17  respectively  Moreover  we expect the index s earnings to increase to 15 7   17 5  and 18 1  in 1Q18  2Q18 and 3Q18  respectively Which Stocks to Focus On Given the healthy expectations for earnings  most analysts believe that the market will not be unstable for long Picking stocks with strong fundamentals seems to be a smart option but the task can be a daunting one This is where our  comes in handy  Here  V stands for Value  G for Growth  and M for Momentum  and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank and VGM Score  Moreover  we have chosen firms with market capitalization of more than 10

144102,365617,KSS,U S  stocks fall sharply as commodity sell off  rate hike timing weigh,news,"Investing com    U S  stocks fell precipitously on Thursday  as massive sell offs in the energy and commodity sectors and the prospect of a December interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve weighed heavily on all three major indices 
A stronger than expected inventory build last week and bearish supply forecasts from OPEC on Thursday pushed oil prices to fresh two and a half month lows  as U S  crude futures fell below  42 a barrel for the first time since late August  Following the decline  the front month for WTI crude future contracts slumped to near six and a half year lows from earlier this summer  At the same time  gold  copper and palladium all tumbled to multi year lows  amid continuing indications from the Fed that it could raise short term interest rates when it meets next on December 15 16 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ Composite index fell sharply extending losses from earlier this week  while the S P 500 Composite index closed lower for the sixth time in seven sessions  On Thursday  the Dow lost 254 28 or 1 44  to 17 447 94  while the NASDAQ dropped 61 94 or 1 22  to close at 2 045 97  The S P 500  meanwhile  fell 29 03 or 1 40  to 2 045 97 as all 10 sectors closed in the red  Stocks in the Energy and Basic Materials sectors lagged  each plunging by more than 2  on the session  Stocks in the Industrials  Health Care and Financials industries each fell by at least 1 5  
While a handful of Fed policymakers  including chair Janet Yellen made public comments on Thursday  none appeared strongly opposed to normalizing monetary policy at next month s highly anticipated meeting  On Thursday evening  Fed chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to deliver a speech on the transmission of exchange rates to output and inflation at the Fed s post Financial Crisis conference in Washington  Nearly a decade has passed since the Fed last raised its benchmark Federal Funds Rate 
A rate hike is largely viewed as bearish for equity markets as investors exit their positions to take advantage of higher yields in bonds

144103,365618,KSS,Weak retail sales suggest moderate fourth quarter economic growth,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  retail sales rose less than expected in October amid a surprise decline in automobile purchases  suggesting a slowdown in consumer spending that could temper expectations of a strong pickup in fourth quarter economic growth  Other data on Friday showed a second straight monthly decline in producer prices as the cost of services fell  Still  the soft inflation and signs of slowing consumer spending are unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates next month  economists said   The weak reports will provide some cause for caution at the Fed  and while they are unlikely to change the prevailing bias for a December  liftoff   they could add to the case for a shallower tightening path thereafter   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0 1 percent last month after being unchanged in both September and August  Economists had forecast sales increasing 0 3 percent  Sales at auto dealerships fell 0 5 percent last month after rising 1 4 percent in September  The decline was surprising given that automakers reported strong sales for October  Economists said heavy discounting to attract buyers was likely to blame for the discrepancy   A 0 9 percent drop in the value of sales at service stations  which reflected lower gasoline prices  also helped to restrain retail sales last month  Retail sales excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food services rose 0 2 percent after a 0 1 percent gain in September  These so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product   The lackluster report suggests that savings from cheaper gasoline are being used to pay rents  which have increased substantially over the past year    Barclays   L BARC  trimmed its fourth quarter GDP estimate by one tenth of a percentage point to a 2 4 percent annual rate  The weak October retail sales also could raise concerns about the upcoming holiday shopping season   Economists  however  are optimistic of sturdy consumer spending in the final months of the year  as a pickup in job growth and low inflation boost disposable income  CONSUMERS UPBEAT That view was supported by a separate report showing the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index rose to 93 1 in early November from a reading of 90 0 in October   The survey showed an improvement in buying plans for large discretionary purchases  especially vehicles  Lower income households also were upbeat about their prospects in November    The rise in confidence to the level last seen in July might ease a few concerns at the Fed about slowing growth in recent months   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York  A third report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index fell 0 4 percent last month after dropping 0 5 percent in September   In the 12 months through October  the PPI fell 1 6 percent  the largest decline since the revamped series started in 2009 and following on the heels of a 1 1 percent drop in September  October also marked the ninth straight 12 month decrease in the index  The weak spending and inflation data did not significantly shift expectations the Fed will raise rates next month in the wake of October s robust employment report   U S  rates futures implied that traders saw a 66 percent chance of a rate hike in December  compared to 70 percent on Thursday  according to CME Group s FedWatch  The U S  central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero since December 2008  The Standard   Poor s retail index  fell 2 28 percent  underperforming an overall weak U S  stock market  Retailer Macys   N M  dropped 2 5 percent and department store operator Kohls  N KSS  declined 6 5 percent  Prices of U S  Treasuries were trading higher and the dollar rose against a basket of currencies  Economic growth braked to a 1 5 percent rate in the third quarter as businesses worked through an inventory glut and energy companies continued to cut back spending in response to lower oil prices   But a fourth report from the Commerce Department suggested the drag on third quarter growth from inventories was probably not as large as initially thought  Retail inventories excluding autos  which go into the GDP calculation  increased 0 5 percent in September after a similar rise in August  With a report earlier this week showing a solid rise in wholesale inventories in September  JPMorgan  N JPM  said it expected third quarter GDP would be raised to a 2 3 percent rate when the government publishes its revision later this month

144118,365633,KSS,Online Vs  Offline Retail  Recent ETF Winners,opinion,"Struggles seem to be over for department stores  at least for some time  given Kohl s   NYSE KSS   and J C  Penney   NYSE JCP   s  same store sales performances  Consumers  tendency to shift to online shopping or  Amazonization  has long been a cause for concern for brick and mortar retailing  But efficient cost and inventory management brought this overlooked space into the limelight lately 
investors should note that J C  Penney Co  came up with its third quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 10  Its adjusted loss per share of 33 cents was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 43 cents  Revenues of  2 81 billion also came ahead of the estimate of  2 76 billion  Comparable sales rose 1 7  in the quarter  compared with a decline of 0 8  recorded in the prior year quarter 
Management noted that during the third quarter  steadfast actions were taken to    primarily allowing for an improved apparel assortment heading into the holiday season   Management believes these measures will better position the company in the all important holiday season 
Such optimistic comments led shares of J C  Penney to add more than 15  on Nov 10  which in turn acted as a cornerstone for the whole space  Macy s Inc    NYSE M   added 2 5  and Kohl s gained about 4 5  on Nov 10 
How About Online Retailing  
On the other hand  Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   lost about 0 3  on that day  Clear indications of a turnaround in department stores may mar the lure of online retailing in the near term  This is especially true given that online retail stocks have attained several heights in the recent past  calling for certain overvaluation and making this a too late to enter space 
As per Moody s  Amazon com Inc  is doing great in terms of sales growth but   Amazon s Prime Membership is apparently exaggerated by some analysts  read    
If we look beyond J C  Penney  Wal Mart   NYSE WMT   is also proving its mettle  According to Jim Cramer  Wal Mart has proved the    point with a host of growth initiatives and posed itself as one of the close competitors of Amazon  read    
Investors should note that traditional retailers are capitalizing on Amazon s popularity lately  For example  Kohl s has  with Amazon under which the former will start selling Amazon devices  like Echo and Fire tablets  at 10 stores in Los Angeles and Chicago from October  Prior to this  in July  Sears   NASDAQ SHLD   entered into a deal to sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon 
Moreover  Amazon belongs to a Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 32   at the time of writing while JCP is in the top 45  
Recent Performances 
Thanks probably to the above reasons  Amplify Online Retail ETF  lost about 1 2  in the last 10 days  as of Nov 10  2017  while VanEck Vectors Retail ETF   V RTH   and SPDR S P Retail  MX XRT  ETF  added about 2 1  and 0 1   respectively   If no severe downfall in the department stores data and outlook hits the market  we expect the recent winning trend of department stores to continue

144142,365657,KSS,Fossil Group  FOSL  Down On Q3 Earnings Decline   Dull View,opinion,Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   reported third quarter 2017 results  wherein the top and bottom line plummeted year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s performance was negatively impacted by sluggish traditional watch business and persistent weakness in the leather and jewelry categories  Further  management slashed guidance for 2017 in response to the weak results  consequently impacting investor sentiment Evidently  shares of Fossil Group declined 10 4  during after hours trading on Nov 7  We note that Fossil Group has been delivering sluggish results for quite some time  which is reflected in its share price history  The company s shares have plunged 74 8  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 28 5  Q3 Earnings Adjusted earnings were 4 cents per share in the quarter which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents  However  the bottom line declined significantly from 48 cents reported in the year ago period  The slump can be attributed to lower sales and margins On a GAAP basis  the company reported a loss of 11 cents  We note that during the quarter  Fossil Group gained 2 cents from favorable foreign currency movements Fossil Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarter in Detail Net sales of  688 7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  653 2 million  Though connected watches boosted sales  overall net sales declined 6 7  from the prior year quarter  primarily due to sluggishness in the company s traditional watch portfolio  On a constant currency basis  sales declined 8  during the quarter  Underlying weakness in the company s leather and jewelry businesses also marred the top line performance during the quarter  Global retail comps  including e commerce  dropped 6  year over year  with softness across all categories and geographies Gross profit tumbled 16 9  to  319 9 million  Gross margin contracted 580 basis points  bps  to 46 4  due to lower margins from connected products and increased product valuation charges  Lower retail margins stemming from greater promotional activity  unfavorable currency impacts and increased off price sales also dragged the gross margin  These downsides were partly compensated by margin improvement owing to the New World Fossil initiative For the third quarter  the company s operating loss amounted to  0 5 million  as against the operating income of  31 2 million in the prior year quarter  This can be attributed to lower sales and gross profit  despite lower operating expenses Performance Based on Business Categories Category wise  sales in the watches segment declined 2 7   down 4  on constant currency basis  to  551 9 million in the quarter  Fossil Group has been struggling with its watch category for quite some time now  Management noted that higher demand for tech enabled watches has been denting traditional watch sales  Though the company has been expanding its smartwatches and wearable portfolio  these efforts are yet to revive results Sales at Jewelry and leather businesses also went down 20 8   down 23  on constant currency basis  to  47 7 million and 18 9   down 20  on constant currency basis  to  75 7 million  respectively  Notably the sales of leather products have been unimpressive on account of unfavorable consumer response Region Wise Performance Region wise  sales slumped 14 7   down 15  on a constant currency basis  in Americas to  308 1 million owing to sales decline in the United States and sluggish performance of traditional watches  This was marginally offset by sales growth in connected watches  The region also witnessed weakness in the leather and jewelry businesses Sales increased 1 6  in Europe  down 2  on a constant currency basis  to  247 2 million  Sales in the region benefitted from fourth quarter early deliveries  However  sales growth in the U K was countered by decline in the Middle East Net sales from Asia declined 0 1   flat on a constant currency basis  to  133 4 million  Sales growth was mainly witnessed in India and China  countered by dismal performance from all other regions  Other UpdatesAt the end of the quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  166 9 million  long term debt of  444 3 million and shareholders  equity of  653 million Since the prior year quarter  the company has undertaken several store closures  At the end of the third quarter of 2017  the company s total store count was 556 compared with 610 stores in the year ago period OutlookFor 2017  Fossil Group expects net sales to decline in the range of 8 5 10 5   comparatively wider than the previously estimated decline of 4 5 8 5   The company expects adjusted operating margin growth in the range of flat to up 1 3   Further  it projects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents  The revised guidance is considerably lower than the prior earnings estimation of 35 cents to  1 15 For fourth quarter 2017  the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 11 3 5   Adjusted operating margin growth is anticipated in the range of 1 8 5 5   Consequently  Fossil Group expects adjusted earnings in the range of 10 65 cents per share Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category  However  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company anticipates considerable growth opportunities in the connected wearables business and plans to continue investing in the same  It also remains on track with New World Fossil initiative which has been aiding cost reduction and inducing efficiency in its operations Stocks to Consider

144180,365695,KSS,Is Kohl s Corporation  KSS  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Kohl s Corp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Kohl s Corp s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 33 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Kohl s Corp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 6  so it is fair to say that the stock price might slightly appreciate in future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Kohl s Corp has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  KSS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Kohl s Corp currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Kohl s Corp a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Kohl s Corp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives KSS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimate revisions have been pretty favorable  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 10 8  in the past two months and the full year estimate has gone up by 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Kohl s Corporation Price and Consensus   Despite having a bullish trend  KSS sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   This indicates that analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKohl s Corp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 39  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past three months  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make

The report was the latest chapter in what has been an awful year for Dick s  The stock tumbled to a 52 week low and is now down nearly 50  year to date  On top of this  we ve now seen a whopping 13 negative revisions to its full year and next year earnings estimates  which have dragged the stock down to a Zacks Rank  5  Sell  
 
Dick s will be further challenged by Nike s   NYSE NKE   decision to begin selling its products on Amazon a move that only adds to the company s competition  Looking ahead  profits are expected to slump by over 45  this quarter and 6  this fiscal year  and that regression is expected to continue into the next fiscal year as well 
 
2        Ingles Markets    NYSE M   
In today s retail landscape  it should come as no surprise that a regional supermarket chain like Ingles is struggling  As the staples of the grocery store become increasingly available online  it s been tough enough for the industry s giants to compete let alone a company that doesn t have the advantage of scale 
Shares of Ingles have fallen more than 46  year to date  and the stock currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Earnings are expected to slump more than 12 3  this fiscal year  and the company s cash flow has retracted nearly 1  already 
On top of its questionable financial position right now  Ingles is the type of store that could be threatened the most by Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods  The suburban supermarket can keep up with trendy organic grocers because it can traditionally offer lower prices  but that might change soon 
 
3        Vitamin Shoppe    NYSE VSI   
Vitamin Shoppe shares have been steadily dropping for years now  but 2017 has been a particular rough period for the company  The nutrition supplements retailer just missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by over 40  in the latest quarter  extending its earnings miss streak to three 
The stock has now tumbled more than 75  year to date  Earnings are expected to slump more 66  this fiscal year  and sales are projected to tumble nearly 7   That regression will continue next year  with earnings and sales expected to retract another 4  and 1   respectively

144205,365720,KSS,Kohl s Gains From E Commerce  Declining Comps A Concern,opinion,Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   has been grappling with increasing competition and a general slowdown in consumer spending since the past quarters  Amid such a scenario  the company s efforts to boost sales through e Commerce development and its focus on outside brands proved to be a boon to investors and were well reflected in the impressive second quarter of fiscal 2017 results We note that shares of the company have been gaining momentum since the past three months  Kohl s shares have increased 12 2  compared with the  s gain of 3 5  Let s now delve deeper into the factors that have been impacting the company s performance Initiatives to Improve Store Sales   Growing e Commerce In an effort to boost store sales Kohl s has been focusing on offering more outside famous brands  which are popular  and cutting down on the number of in house clothing brands  The addition of Under Armour workout tights  sneakers and other gears in March 2017 was a great success and well received by customers  The company is also focusing on sales growth with both Nike  NYSE NKE  and Adidas  DE ADSGN   In respect to its own private label brands  it plans to continue with its best sellers such as Sonoma  Croft   Barrow and Apt  9 Additionally  the company also remained on track with its store expansion  It plans to launch four small format stores in October 2017  adding to its existing fleet of eight small format stores that were opened in 2016  Kohl s e Commerce platform witnessed sturdy growth over the last few years  Its e Commerce sales have almost doubled since 2011 at a compound annual growth rate of almost 40  in the last five years  In the second quarter of fiscal 2017  digital conversion improved at a double digit rate on the back of better customer experiences on smartphone and smartphone applications  In fact  technology improvements in both the application as well as device and the omnichannel efforts are expected to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience  In order to better support online growth  the company has also been opening fulfillment centers Strong Inventory Management   Innovation The company s inventory reduction initiatives have been positively impacting merchandise margins and thereby its gross profit levels  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017  inventory per store decreased 2   Kohl s continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid single digits for fiscal 2017 Kohl s store development plans also incorporate optimizing and rightsizing store space to better serve customers and operate efficiently  The company has plans to lessen operations in half of its stores by the end of 2017  This would require the stores to balance its inventory and adjust fixtures Kohl s regularly introduces new brands in order to keep the inventory assortment fresh and drive customer traffic to its stores and website  Popular launches like Fit Bed under its active and wellness business  the Jumping Beans collection featuring Disney characters  IZOD branded menswear and the Juicy Couture brand for women and girls have been well received by consumers  Such efforts have also aided in strengthening the company s brand portfolio Headwinds Lurking in the Industry Although Kohl s is focusing on improving its e Commerce businesses to tap in the growing popularity of online shopping  its online business share is much lower than Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN    which dominates the e Commerce market space  The growing online business has also dented company s store traffic as well as comps In fact  the company s comps have been declining since past few quarters  Lower consumer spending on apparel and accessories and competition from discount retailers has also impacted comps negatively  This signals that its turnaround initiative named  Greatness Agenda  is failing to deliver results Greatness Agenda  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually  thus posing a concern  Moreover  comps have declined consecutively in the last six quarters  including the second quarter fiscal 2017 results Bottom Line Despite such industry headwinds  we expect that Kohl s store expansion strategies  in store inventory management initiatives and e Commerce development efforts would continue yielding results Kohl s

144222,365737,KSS,Price Is What You Pay  Value Is What You Get  Warren Buffett ,opinion,"The current complaint from many investment strategists and portfolio managers is securities are highly priced  specifically stocks and bonds  but not currencies like bitcoin  right   You may have heard such commentary from luminaries like Howard Marks  Jeff Gundlach  and the veritable maestro  ex Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  Why  even Janet Yellen weighed in with similar thoughts a few months ago  if we can dust off the cobwebs from that long ago 
So  if these distinguished people are so disenchanted with our situation  it might be worth our time to delve into the subject of value  The definition of value is deserving of worth  There is plenty of academic teaching which can help people learn about how to value securities  the most prominent probably Aswath Damodaran  NYU  and Bruce Greenwald  Columbia   Professor Damodaran does a great job of analyzing stocks and his distinction between valuing securities and pricing them is notable  you might try his blog  Musing on Markets  
In everyday life  the quest for value can impact ones life on a daily basis  There is value in trusting your employer or fellow co workers  A clean and secure home and working environment is enormously important  A healthy meal which you pay a fair price for has great value  versus a large plate plenty of restaurants serve to impress their paying customers  but pay for it in other ways a few hours later   Nice music has value  especially early in the morning or late at night as a way to relax 
Everyone s time has value  as there are only twenty four hours in a day for all of us  Not standing in line is always a treat  especially when one is in between appointments  Unique and simple merchandising has demonstrable value in business  as does excellent planning  In nearly any activity  understanding logistics has tremendous value  clearly helped by technology and global positioning services  Last  but certainly not least  a good book has potentially as much value as anything anywhere  I am sure you too can think of your own examples of value  unrelated to securities  which impact ones everyday life  Looking for value is certainly not limited to the investment profession 
As for markets this week  the onslaught of corporate earnings continued with a wide variety of results  as usual  In the media space  CBS posted a nice number while recent IPO Snap took it on the chin  yet again  It s fellow compatriot in the IPO arena this year  Blue Apron  NYSE APRN   joined them on the not wanted list with a tough quarter  too 
In better news  the unique auction house Ritchie Brothers showed a good result  as did home builder William Lyon  NYSE WLH   In another house  this time of pain  the high end Brazilian steakhouse Fogo De Chao  NASDAQ FOGO  did meet expectations  Joining this neighborhood is the always pleasant retail space  where Macy s  NYSE M   JC Penney  NYSE JCP   and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  were brutalized by investors disappointed with poor same store sales 
Is there ever a quarter where this is not the case  cannot think of one in recent memory   On the macro front  the CPI reading came in light at  1    2  expected   With all the earnings news  and plenty of it good  the question remains  what caused the plunge this week 
Ah  yes  how could we ever forget about the joy which is politics  The markets reacted to the non stop bellicose rhetoric from North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un  their idiot strongman  and President Donald Trump  our egotistical strongman   clearly not liking the gamesmanship  You know the old quote   He may be an idiot  but at least he is our idiot  
Still  there are distinct differences which should be noted 
First  college students from other countries can come to the United States without being imprisoned  tortured  and left brain dead if they  gosh forbid  make a minor mistake 
Second  the United States has the world s largest economy  and North Korea has  um  uh  well  very little in terms of an economy  I am being kind   In fact  90  of all it s trade comes from one country  that being  yup  you guessed it  China 
Third  historically  the North Korean leader and his family has consistently made threatening statements towards democratic countries and is actively working to obtain nuclear weapons  The United States is the military leader of the world  which includes the best private companies and their technology and weaponry  including those related to nuclear delivery 
The biggest issue for investors is the problem is not solvable because of the logistics involved  As long as both of these  leaders  are breathing and in charge of their respective countries  because they just don t know how to stay quiet and lead  markets have to deal with their bombastic statements  Well  at least in the United States we are becoming more accustomed to the daily assortment from Donald  so we can take value from that

144224,365739,KSS,Leveraged Inverse ETFs That Soared On North Korea Tensions,opinion,Wall Street witnessed the worst weekly performance in months given escalating tensions between the U S  and North Korea  Notably  the S P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial posted their second worst week of the year  shedding 1 4  and 1 1   respectively  while the Nasdaq logged its third worst week plunging 1 5   Meanwhile  the small cap index   Russell 2000   also lost 2 7  last week  representing its biggest one week decline since February 2016 The war of words between Donald Trump and North Korean officials has deepened last week that shook complacency in the broad stock market  prompting risk off trade  Trump has warned that North Korea would face  fire and fury like the world has never seen  if it continues to threaten the U S  and the North Korea retaliated by threatening to launch a missile strike on the U S  Pacific territory of Guam  which is home to a large U S  military base Further  Trump doubled down on his aggressive stance on North Korea by saying that his threat to unleash  fire and fury  on the country was not  tough enough and tweeted that  Military solutions are now fully in place  locked and loaded  should North Korea act unwisely   read    Coupled with rising North Korea tensions  disappointing earnings results from some of the large retailers like Macy s   NYSE M   and Kohl s   NYSE KSS    social media network Snap   NYSE SNAP   and the meal kit maker Blue Apron Holdings   NYSE APRN   weighed on the market Given higher volatility  inverse or leveraged inverse ETFs gained immense popularity last week as investors embraced these products for big gains in a short span though these involve a great deal of risk when compared to traditional products  These products create either a leveraged long short position  an inverse long short position or a leveraged inverse long short position in the underlying index by employing various investment strategies such as swaps  options  future contracts and other financial instruments  Due to their compounding effect  investors can enjoy higher returns in a very short period of time provided the trend remains a friend Below  we have highlighted six such ETFs that crushed the market last week and should continue to do so at least for the near term as long as North Korea tensions perturb the stock market ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF This product provides two times  2x  leveraged exposure to the S P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Index  which measures the returns of a portfolio of monthly VIX futures contracts with a weighted average of one month to expiration  It has amassed  343 9 million in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of 10 3 million shares a day on average  The ETF charges 95 bps in fees per year and gained 45  last week  read    Direxion Daily Regional Banks Bear 3x Shares This fund seeks to deliver thrice  3x  the inverse return of the S P Regional Banks Select Industry Index  charging 95 bps in fees per year  WDRW has accumulated  4 8 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 2 000 shares a day on average  The fund was up 14 8  last week Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3x Shares This product provides 3x exposure to the daily performance of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index  It charges 95 bps in annual fees and has accumulated nearly  775 8 million in its asset base  Volume is heavy  exchanging more than 16 million in shares per day on average  JNUG gained 11 1  in the last week  read      Direxion Daily S P Biotech Bear 3x Shares This product seeks to deliver 3x the inverse daily performance of the S P Biotechnology Select Industry Index  The fund has amassed  96 1 million in its asset base and trades in average daily volume of around 4 9 million shares  It charges investors 95 bps in annual fees and expenses  The ETF delivered returns of 8 8  last week Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3x Shares ETF This product provides 3x inverse exposure to the Energy Select Sector Index  It is extremely popular and trades in heavy volume nearly 1 2 million shares  The ETF charges annual fee of 95 bps and has AUM of  46 9 million  It has gained 8 3  last week Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3x Shares This product provides 3x inverse play to the Russell 2000 Index  charging 95 bps in fees and expenses  It has been able to manage  733 8 million in its asset base with heavy average daily volume of 9 8 million shares  TZA was down 8 3  last week  Bottom LineWhile the strategy is highly beneficial for short term traders  it could lead to huge losses compared with traditional funds in fluctuating or seesaw markets  Further  their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to the shorter period  such as  weeks or months  due to their compounding effect  see    Still  for ETF investors who are bearish on equities for the near term  either of the above products could make an interesting choice  Clearly  this could be intriguing for those with high risk tolerance should the trend continue in this specific corner

144242,365757,KSS,Can Kohl s  KSS  Sales Boosting Initiatives Aid Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is set to report the second quarter of fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10 before the market opens  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether the departmental store will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter  We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 21 3   In fact  earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of past 10 quarters 
Kohl s forms part of the Retail Wholesale sector  Per the latest   we note that the above mentioned sector s earnings growth looks disappointing  Out of the 41 5  S P 500 companies that have reported in the sector as of Aug 4  we see that total earnings of these companies have declined 2 3  on a year over year basis  64 7  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue increased 8 0   70 6  beat top line expectations  
Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has increased 1 7  over the last seven days and is currently pegged at  1 17 per share  down 4 4  from  1 22 per share delivered in the year ago quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  4 1 billion  down 1 7  from the prior year period Kohl s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kohl s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Kohl s has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 17 per share  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Kohl s has been struggling with weak comps and a difficult retail sales scenario for the last few quarters  The company s strategic initiative   Greatness Agenda   which was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  is also failing to deliver positive results  Though the plan  which commenced in the first quarter of 2014  has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually but then started declining since the first quarter of fiscal 2016  posing a concern  We note that comps plummeted consecutively in the last five quarters  The company is also witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories  dwindling store traffic  margin pressure and competition from discount retailers  which are hurting sales at department stores 
Nevertheless  Kohl s has been making continuous efforts to improve its base business  Lately  the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in house clothing brands it sells  The addition of Under Armour workout tights  sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and was very well accepted among customers  It also helped to boost sales of the entire active apparel department in the first quarter despite decline in women s  children s and accessories units  Kohl s plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back to school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles  The company also plans to continue selling the best selling of its private label brands  such as Sonoma  Croft   Barrow and Apt  9  in order to drive traffic 
Kohl s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017  the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result  inventory per store decreased 1   while units per store were 5  lower  Lower inventory levels thus boost its earnings  The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid single digits for the fiscal year 2017 
We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the company  Notably  in the last three months  the stock has moved up 7 3  in comparison to the  and the broader sector  While the industry declined 4 7  in the last three months  the sector increased 3 0  in the said time frame 

Stocks with Favorable Combination
Stocks in the broader retail sector carrying both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  and therefore worth considering include 
Dollar General Corporation   NYSE DG   has an Earnings ESP of  0 93  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

144244,365759,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Beats Q2 Earnings And Sales On Improved Comps,opinion,"Retailer Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   posted impressive second quarter fiscal 2017 results  Shares of the retailer moved up more than 2 5  in the pre market trading 
Kohl s reported adjusted earnings of  1 24 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 19 by 4 2   Earnings also grew 2  from the prior year quarter owing to improved sales trend in all lines of business  strong inventory and expense management Kohl s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Sales and Margins
Net sales of  4 144 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 138 billion  However  it dipped 0 9  from the prior year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales  comps   This signals that the company s strategic initiative Greatness Agenda is failing to deliver results  The initiative  which commenced in first quarter 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates were declining  thus posing a concern  Further  comps started declining since first quarter fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next six quarters  including the current one 
Encouragingly  the 0 4  drop in comps in the second quarter was narrower than the preceding quarter s decline of 2 7  and prior year quarter s decline of 1 8   owing to increased traffic momentum witnessed in the second quarter  Though transactions for the quarter were lower than last year  they increased in the month of July  which also benefited the quarter 
Gross margin declined only 6 basis points to 39 4  in the reported quarter  Selling  general and administrative expenses fell 0 3  to  983 million in the quarter 
Other Financial Details
As of Jul 29  Kohl s had  552 million of cash and cash equivalents   2 79 billion of long term debt and  5 03 billion of shareholders  equity  Cash flow from operations were  376 million  while capital expenditure were  399 million 
On Aug 8  the Kohl s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share  which will be paid on Sep 20  to shareholders of record as of Sep 6 
Kohl s ended the year with 1 154 Kohl s stores  12 FILA Outlet stores  and four Off Aisle clearance centers in 49 states 
Our Take
We note that Kohl s has been struggling for the last few quarters to boost its sluggish top line  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores  Kohl s and its competitors have struggling in an intensely competitive market from online retailers 
Nevertheless  Kohl s has been making continuous efforts to improve its base business  Lately  the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in house clothing brands it sells  The addition of Under Armour workout tights  sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and well accepted among customers  It also helped to boost sales of the entire active apparel department in the first quarter despite decline in women s  children s and accessories units  Kohl s plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back to school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles  The company also plans to continue selling the best selling of its private label brands  such as Sonoma  Croft   Barrow and Apt  9  in order to drive traffic 
Kohl s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits  During first quarter fiscal 2017  the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result  inventory per store decreased 1   while units per store were 5  lower  Lower inventory levels thus boosted earnings  The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid single digits for the fiscal year 2017 
We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the company  Notably  in the last three months  the stock has moved up 12 8  in comparison to the  and the broader  sector  While the industry grew 6 0  in the last three months  the sector increased 2 9  in the said time frame

144268,365783,KSS,Investors Get Amazonitis As Nasdaq Rolls ,opinion,"There are so many kinds of madness  so many ways in which the human brain may go wrong  and so often it happens that what we call madness is both reasonable and just  It is so  Yes  A little reason is good for us  a little more makes wise men of some of us  but when our reason over grows us and we reach too far  something breaks and we go insane 
Throughout history  when explorers made long trips to distant parts of the world  usually in the quest for riches via colonization  occasionally  these brave souls fell mysteriously ill  The common situation was they traveled to hot  muggy  humid places and were diagnosed with the precise description of   Jungle Fever   Nowadays  it would be called malaria  but back then it was often fatal  Still  even now  there are segments of our society which all of a sudden go ill  but not physically  instead  they become mentally ill  Now  in no way am I disparaging people with severe mental illnesses as they rightly deserve our compassion and medical treatment  sadly  too many are not getting it   Specifically  I am calling out many in the investor class who have  in my estimation  fallen to the popular delusion of cray cray  known as Amazonitis 
You see  as the value of the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  enterprise now approaches over half a trillion smackers  it is now believed that anything retail related will ultimately succumb to the aggressive tactics by Bezos and company  Let s consider the retail pharmacy area  dominated by two solid companies  Walgreen s and CVS  Both have lost plenty of market value in the last few weeks after Amazon announced its purchase of Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM   Well run companies like Costco  NASDAQ COST  and Bed Bath   Beyond Inc  NASDAQ BBBY  have suffered similar fates  In the department store area  if you are a shareholder of Macy s Inc  NYSE M  or Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS   looking at your share price could make you join the ranks of the insane  if you get my drift  This week  Amazon released a new extension of Amazon prime called Amazon Prime Wardrobe  and naturally it s stock rose while anything related to fashion fell  It seems the case of Amazonitis has spread far and wide  so much so that Amazon s stock price is up over 40  for this year alone  As such  if one were a skeptic  and you know I am  it begs the question is this an accurate assessment of the retail landscape and could there be an opportunity among those entities which might be unfairly tarred 
Regarding the first query  there is no question Amazon is a juggernaut and it s Amazon Prime service  with over 50 million subscribers  is formidable for the value it brings to consumers  Still  with the overcapacity among malls and retailers closing huge numbers of stores  I suspect much of the carnage is self inflicted by management teams believing their site selection was impervious to competitive forces  As for the second question  the investment world makes decisions based on performance and quarterly results speak for themselves  If the retailers can begin to claw back market share  you will see a different attitude across the allocation landscape  after all  the quest for ownership of a rising stock is a disease which afflicts anyone in the market  sane or insane 
Elsewhere  the NASDAQ hard hitters shone this week as Adobe  Red Hat  and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  laid waste to earnings estimates  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  and Carnival  LON CCL  showed nice results while Sonic Corp  NASDAQ SONC  met expectations  The Finish Line Inc  NASDAQ FINL  and Bed Bath and Beyond had poor quarters and naturally  you know which company benefited from those figures  Up north  a big housing lender was given a lifeline by the noted humanitarian  Warren Buffett  who injected capital and received his customary pole position in the debt and equity  Charlie Munger  in a CNBC video  commented on the investment prowess of Al Gore  and you might take a look at it when you have a chance

 We are looking to improve the Nike consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling   Nike CEO Mark Parker said 
This announcement comes on the heels of Nike s positive fourth quarter fiscal 2017   The company posted earnings of  0 60 per share and revenues of  8 68 billion  This beat Zacks  earnings and revenue estimates  which were  0 49 per share and  8 61 billion  respectively

144303,365818,KSS,Should Value Investors Pick Kohl s Corporation  KSS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Kohl s Corp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 90  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 29  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Kohl s Corp s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Regional Department Stores industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 80  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Kohl s Corp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 59  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Kohl s Corp has a P S ratio of about 0 35  This is far lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few year  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Kohl s Corp currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Kohl s Corp a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Kohl s Corp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives KSS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate going higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and three downward revision in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 0 85  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has remained flat  3 60  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Kohl s Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKohl s Corp is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 42  out of more than 250 industries  strengthens its growth potential  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on

	Chicago  IL   April 21  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon  NASDAQ           Macy s  NYSE           JC Penney s  NYSE           Kohl s  NYSE          and Dillard s  NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Amazon Has Patented On Demands Clothing  Here s Why 

	Most of us are generally familiar with the concept of just in time inventory  but ecommerce giant Amazon  NASDAQ          is now set to take that concept to a whole new level  At least as far as apparel fashion is concerned 

	This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has won a patent for on demand clothing that it applied for back in 2015 

Patent Details

	Two of the inventors  Aaron Barnet and Nancy Liang are co founders of the 3 D printing startup Mixee Labs that the company bought back in Feb 2015  So 3D printing will likely play a role 

	The patent is essentially for an entire system of manufacturing apparel from the point of collecting orders by a  computing device   deciding on the most efficient method of production based on geography  fabric type  assembly process or other criteria  printing the fabric  cutting and so forth 

	The patent reads   Once various textile products are printed  cut and assembled according to the orders  they can be processed through a quality check  photographed for placement in an electronic commerce system  shipped to customers and or stored in a materials handling facility for order fulfillment  By aggregating orders from various geographic locations and coordinating apparel assembly processes on a large scale  the embodiments provide new ways to increase efficiency in apparel manufacturing  

	It s also careful to mention that the technology won t be limited to clothing alone but can be applied to fabric products  accessories  e g   scarves  gloves  hats  bags  belts  etc    footwear  bedding  curtains  towels  etc   in a wide variety of materials including  but not limited to paper  plastic  leather  rubber and other materials 

What Could Amazon Be Up To 

	It s exciting to think that we could choose our print  cut and make of clothing and then have somebody deliver our choice to our doorstep  But that is likely not Amazon s intention because it won t help drive efficiency or lower cost  and would most definitely be a very cumbersome project 

	On the other hand  consider that Amazon already deals with a large number of third party sellers that use its Fulfilled by Amazon  FBA  service  Amazon also said that active sellers in FBA grew 70  year over year in 2016 and fulfilled units  both FBA and otherwise  grew 40   That means Amazon is stocking a steadily increasing amount of inventory at its warehouses to help it quickly handle both deliveries and returns  If it can collaborate with sellers to make the process more efficient  it could save costs while also increasing customer satisfaction 

	The other possibility  a strong one  is that Amazon would like to further expand its own fabric categories from the eight it currently has and take its in house brands to new fast growing geographies 

Conclusion

	What exactly Amazon intends to do with this technology is of course an open question right now  But a couple of years back  John Blackledge of Cowen   Co expected the company to become the largest clothing retailer by 2017 end  overtaking Macy s  NYSE          and also leaving other retailers like JC Penney s  NYSE           Kohl s  NYSE          Dillard s  NYSE         and Epic Stores in the dust  Amazon doesn t break out these sales but patents like this one indicate that its plans are deep  So after books and electronics  apparel could really be the next big thing for the ecommerce giant

144330,365845,KSS,Will Sluggish Comps Dampen Kohl s  KSS  Earnings In Q1 ,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is set to report first quarter of fiscal 2017 results on May 11 before the market opens  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether the departmental store will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter  We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 7 98  
Kohl s forms part of the Retail Wholesale sector  Per the latest Zacks   we note that the above mentioned sector s earnings growth looks disappointing  Total earnings for the sector are estimated to fall 2 2  on margin decline of 0 2   while revenues are projected to improve 3 3  
Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way Are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has declined marginally over the past 30 days and is currently pegged at 28 cents  down 9 7  from 31 cents delivered in the year ago quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  3 9 billion  down 1 9  from the prior year period 
What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kohl s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Kohl s has an Earnings ESP of  3 57   which makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat  However  it carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   It is to be noted that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Kohl s has been struggling to boost its sluggish top line since the past many quarters  Sluggish comps and a difficult retail sales scenario are hurting sales at department stores 
The sluggish trend is also reflected in Kohl s share prices on a year to date basis due to a challenging sales environment and soft comparable store sales  Notably  in the said period the stock declined 12 2  in comparison to the Zacks categorized  sector  which showcased growth of 13 2  

Despite Kohl s continuous efforts to improve its base business  its strategic initiative   Greatness Agenda   which was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  is failing to deliver positive results  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually  thus posing a concern 
Moreover  comps declined in all the four quarters of fiscal 2016  This is raising concerns over the near term  The company is also witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories  dwindling store traffic  margin pressure and competition from discount retailers  which are hurting sales at department stores  We believe the trend is not expected to improve in the to be reported quarter Kohl s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the broader retail sector carrying both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  and therefore worth considering include 
The Home Depot Inc    NYSE HD   has an Earnings ESP of  0 62  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   has an Earnings ESP of  2 08  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 
Jack In The Box Inc    NASDAQ JACK   has an Earnings ESP of  4 40  and carries a Zacks Rank  2

144331,365846,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Beats On Q1 Earnings  Sales Miss Estimates,opinion,"Retailer Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   delivered better than expected earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  Revenues however marginally missed the consensus mark 
Kohl s reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents by 39 3   Earnings also grew 26  from the prior year quarter owing to margin improvement  driven by strong inventory and expense management 
Sales and Margins
Net sales of  3 843 billion marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 864 billion  Also  it declined 3 2  from the prior year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales  comps  
Comps dropped 2 7  in the first quarter  wider than the preceding quarter s decline of 2 2   This signals that the company s strategic initiative Greatness Agenda is failing to deliver results  The initiative  which commenced in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates were declining  thus posing a concern  Further  comps started declining since the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next five quarters  including the current one   
We note that Kohl s has been struggling since the past many quarters to boost its sluggish top line  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores  Kohl s and its competitors have struggling in an intensely competitive market from online retailers 
The sluggish trend is also reflected in Kohl s share prices on a year to date basis  Notably  in the said period the stock declined 18 4  in comparison to the Zacks categorized  sector  which showcased growth of 13 9  

However  comps decline was narrower than the year ago quarter s decline of 3 9   This is due to the significant improvement in sales and traffic in the months of March and April  despite the sluggish growth trend witnessed by the company in February 
Gross margin also increased 83 basis points to 36 4  in the reported quarter  Operating margin also improved 53 basis points to 4 8  owing to lower selling  general and administrative expenses Kohl s Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Other Financial Details
As of Apr 29  Kohl s had  625 million of cash and cash equivalents   2 79 billion of long term debt and  4 99 billion of shareholders  equity  Cash flow from operations were  46 million  while capital expenditure were  216 million 
On May 10  the Kohl s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share  which will be paid on Jun 21  to shareholders of record as of Jun 7 
Kohl s ended the year with 1 154 Kohl s stores  12 FILA Outlet stores  and three Off Aisle clearance centers in 49 states 
Fiscal 2017 Outlook                                                                         
The company did not provide any update on fiscal 2017 outlook in the current quarter  In the preceding quarter  management had anticipated earnings in the range of  3 50  3 80 per share for fiscal 2017  Management expects sales to be up 0 7  to down 1 3   which includes sales of approximately  160 million in the 53rd week  Comparable sales are expected to be flat to down 2  
Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Kohl s currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
Better ranked stocks in the retail sector are Rocky Brands  Inc    NASDAQ RCKY    The Children s Place  Inc    NASDAQ PLCE   and Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT    While both Rocky Brands and Children s Place sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Wal Mart carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Rocky Brands posted a positive surprise of 42 9  in the preceding quarter  While Children s Place has expected long term earnings growth of 8 00   Wal Mart has expected long term earnings growth of 6 1  for the next three to five years

144347,365862,KSS,3  Uninvestable  Industries Facing Severe Disruption In 2017,opinion,"The  Trump Bump  will soon come to an end  and earnings will once again drive stocks higher or lower  Bulls think 2017 S P 500 operating earnings could hit  130 per share  Who knows if this happens  Even in times of relative stability  it s foolish to predict the markets and probably the only thing everyone can agree on these days is that our current situation is far from stable 
There are too many variables  including uncertainties about the policies President elect Trump will put forward  to have any clue where the market will wind up at year s end  Will Trump succeed in cutting the corporate tax rate or start a crippling trade war with China  Will he  repeal and replace  the Affordable Care Act or throw the whole healthcare sector into chaos  Your guess is as good as mine  and anybody who claims to know is probably a partisan hack or a salesperson  or both 
One thing we can be sure of is that  as always  a handful of big movers will disproportionately impact the indexes in 2017  Last year NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  was that stock  I wish I knew what this year s breakout name will be  but all I can offer with some certainty is that even if the indexes post another year of low double digit increases  more stocks will struggle than flourish 
Quite a few businesses could vanish altogether  Avoiding these laggards and soon to be zeroes is just as important to investing success as scouting for potential five or ten baggers  And one of the best ways to do so is to identify larger secular trends 
Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter famously applauded the  creative destruction  aspect of capitalism  the method by which companies  and entire industries  go broke because a person or a company invents a better way of doing things  Analyzing this process is not easy  Nobody rings a bell alerting investors to sell stocks about to be disrupted into oblivion  If anything  as I ve described before  they often appear temptingly inexpensive by valuation metrics such as price to earnings or price to cash flow just before they vanish 
Moreover  analysts and pundits often encourage bottom fishing for seemingly cheap stocks in troubled industries  I still have a stack of bullish analyst reports recommending stocks in forgotten sectors like video rental stores  pay phones  and pagers  All of them cited attractive valuations  Most of the companies being recommended no longer exist 
Even businesses that manage to survive industry bloodbaths rarely  if ever  receive premium valuations again  Technology stocks are great examples  Disk drive survivors Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  and Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  perpetually sell at low PE ratios  as do auto industry survivors General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford  NYSE F   If GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO  and Fitbit  NYSE FIT  recover from last year s drubbings  both are likely doomed to sell at a fraction of their once rich valuations 
Today  three industries  and others I have yet to identify  are facing severe disruptions  First  and foremost  is brick and mortar retailing  Hardly a week goes by without a high profile retailer reporting disappointing monthly or quarterly sales  followed by a stock price collapse  Macy s  NYSE M  and Kohl s  NYSE KSS  both rang in the New Year by dropping 14 percent and 19 percent  respectively  on weak Christmas sales 
Meanwhile  e commerce competitors  especially Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   are rapidly taking market share  Amazon s 2016 revenues were over  135 billion  vs   107 billion in 2015 and  89 billion in 2014  By comparison  Wal Mart s  NYSE WMT  2016 revenues were about  486 billion  vs   482 billion in 2015  In other words  the most powerful force in brick and mortar retailing over the last generation has virtually stopped growing while its main online competitor has been growing steadily at 20  percent and shows no signs of letting up 
Many smaller retailers recently filed for bankruptcy  including Pacific Sunwear  American Apparel  Wet Seal  Aeropostale  OTC AROPQ   Sports Authority  Sports Chalet  and Fairway Grocery Stores  Existing public chains facing extinction include Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   Gordmans  NASDAQ GMAN   Bon Ton Stores  NASDAQ BONT  HHGregg  NYSE HGG   and Stage Stores  NYSE SSI  
There will be more  and the survivors will sell at ever lower valuations  This powerful trend prompted Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  to label the entire group as close to  uninvestable  following poor holiday sales and the just completed annual ICR retail conference in Orlando 
The asset management industry is also facing headwinds  A secular shift toward indexing  plus the soon the be implemented Department of Labor  fiduciary rule  has led to declining assets and declining fees at most mutual fund companies  Assuming this trend continues  these firms will reduce or eliminate their stock buyback programs while others will cut or eliminate quarterly dividends  Historically  these companies have been highly profitable  Gamco Investors Inc  NYSE GBL  paid its leader  Mario Gabelli  roughly  1 billion in cash over the last ten years  Most have minimal debt  But as revenues and profits shrink  price earnings ratios will also likely fall  The upshot is potential declines of 20 50 percent for many industry stocks  Unless these companies are bought out  most could  or should  underperform the market in the next 12 24 months 
A third troubled industry is offshore energy supply companies  As more and more  cheaper and easier to extract oil is discovered onshore  energy companies will likely reduce exorbitant offshore exploration efforts  This will reduce revenues at firms like Tidewater  NYSE TDW   Hornbeck Offshore Services  NYSE HOS   Bristow Group  NYSE BRS  and Ion Geophysical  NYSE IO  
All four depend on offshore drilling and exploration  and all have debt  If oil prices are flattish in 2017  all four will report losses and see further share price declines  Ten months ago  I identified eight exploration companies with high yielding debt Basic  NYSE BAS   Stone  NYSE SGY   Ultra  W T Offshore Inc  NYSE WTI   EXCO  NYSE XCO   Gastar Exploration  NYSE GST   Energy 21  and Linn Energy LLC  OTC LINEQ   Six have since filed Chapter 11  While bankruptcy is not as imminent for these four offshore service companies  all face a difficult future ",2017-01-16,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/three-‘uninvestable’-industries-for-2017-200172437,200172437

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	The US housing market continues to strengthen this year thanks mainly to improvement in the labor market and still low interest rates  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  timber REIT is well positioned to capitalize on the housing market recovery 

About the Company

	Structured as a REIT  Potlatch  NASDAQ        owns approximately 1 4 million acres of forestland in Alabama  Arkansas  Idaho  Minnesota and Mississippi  The company also operates five manufacturing facilities that produce lumber and panel products  They are among the top 10 lumber manufactures in the US 

	Additionally  the company conducts a real estate sales and development business through its subsidiary 

Better than expected Results

	The company reported much better than expected Q4 results  Their adjusted income of 35 cents per share was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents 

	 Strong performance by each of our three businesses and improved lumber prices resulted in solid earnings this year   said the CEO 

Rising Estimates

	Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year have increased to  1 65 and  1 83 respectively  from  1 55 and  1 82  before the results

Falling Estimates

	Analysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak guidance  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to  3 60 per share and  3 66 per share from  3 80 and  3 92 respectively  before the report

Here s Why Cabela s Stock Keeps Climbing

	Cabela s Incorporated s  NYSE        stock price continues to climb Tuesday  up over 7   after its once questioned buyout by fellow outdoor retail giant Bass Pro Shops cleared a pivotal hurdle 

 on Monday that Bass Pro Shops will acquire the hunting mega store company for  5 billion  or approximately  61 50 per share in cash  which marks a  500 million price cut from the initial October buyout terms  The new deal comes after regulatory red tape held up the purchase of Cabela s banking assets 

	The Sidney  Nebraska based company owns its own bank  The World s Foremost Bank  in order to issue Cabela s branded credit cards  Cabela s bank still runs on a relatively antiquated system of financing customer s purchases by issuing CDs 

	According to the new statement  Synovus Financial Corp   NYSE        will now purchase Cabela s banking assets  Synovus  the bank s  1 2 billion in deposits  and then Capital One Financial Corp   NYSE       will buy Cabela s credit card portfolio  Capital One originally planned to buy both of Cabela s financial assets  but regulatory issues held up the deal until Synovus stepped in 

	Privately owned Bass Pro Shops owns over 90 giant retail locations in North America that focus on fishing  boating  and camping  while Cabela s runs roughly 85 stores in the US and Canada in a similar space  but with a primary focus on hunting  Bass Pro Shops does not currently plan to change much about how Cabela s does business 

	Bass Pro Shops and Cabela s hope the deal better positions both outdoor retail brands for the future  as online behemoths such as Amazon com Inc   NASDAQ AMZN  invade more and more retail sectors  even niche markets like fishing and hunting 

	 We re excited to announce this agreement  which allows us to look ahead with greater certainty toward the completion of our merger with Bass Pro Shops and offers a positive step forward for all parties   Cabela s CEO Tommy Millner said in a press release   We look forward to completing these transactions for the benefit of our shareholders  Outfitters and outdoor enthusiasts  

	Cabela s stock price was up 7 28  to  57 60 per share in early afternoon trading on Tuesday 

	The deal is expected to close in the third quarter  However  according to Cabela s statement  it still needs approval from the company s shareholders  and it will need a few more regulatory approvals as well 

 to release its first quarter financial results on May 4  but the company will not hold a call with investors or analysts until the acquisition is fully complete

144367,365882,KSS,Most Overvalued Stock Market In U S  History  Here s Why,opinion,"I find it to be mind blowing when financial advisors and stock market gurus get in bubblevision or write Seeking Alpha articles and assert that the stock market is good  relative  value right now  They are either dishonest  unethical or just stupid  Likely a combination of all three in varying degrees 
Here s a chart with which everyone is familiar 

Based on that graphic  it looks like the current stock market is only the third most overvalued in history  right  WRONG 
The problem comparing the current p e ratio of the S P 500 with that of previous stock bubble tops is that the accounting used to produce the  e  is not comparable  Over time  FASB and the SEC have colluded to make it easier for companies to hide losses and report non cash income as GAAP cash flow and earnings  
As an example  in 2010 FASB issued a bulletin which changed the way big Wall Street banks were allowed to account for bonds and other forms of debt issued by others that are held as assets  Originally  banks had to market their bond debt loan holdings to market and accrue any market to market gains or losses at quarter end as either income or expense  FASB decided to let banks classify any and all debt as  hold to maturity   and allowed banks to hold this debt at face  maturity  value without ever marking to market  Any debt that was marked below maturity value  par value  could be marked up to par and moved into a  held to maturity  account  By doing this  the banks created non cash gains in these holdings that was counted as income  Banks hold  100 s of billions in bonds loans and  starting in 2011  this rule change allowed banks to create billions in phantom  non cash income  This of course translates into lower p e ratios 
There s several areas of accounting over the years that have accomplished a similar feat for all publicly traded companies  The problem is that it has rendered p e ratios over time incomparable  Of course  NO ONE points out this fact and certainly any Wall Street analyst would be fired if they went on a truth tirade  The bottom line is that  looking at the p e ratio graph above  we don t know how the current p e ratio for the S P 500 compares with the p e ratios at the market peaks in 2007 and 2000 and 1929  What we do know is that the current p e ratio is significantly understated relative to the p e ratios in 2007 in 2000 because earnings are overstated relative to those years because of the accounting gimmicks that enable companies to boost GAAP non cash earnings  It could be that the current p e ratio is the highest on record if we could make an  apples to apple  comparison of p e ratios across time  In fact  I would assert that applying standardized GAAP across time would prove that the current market is more overvalued than at any time in U S  history 
The above analysis is an excerpt from my latest issue of the Short Seller s Journal  In this issue I presented two retail stock ideas for shorting  One of them was down 3 7  today and the other was down just under 1   In the past couple of issues I have explained in detail why the retail sector is short opportunity right now  But that window will close quickly as more companies do what happened to Macy s Inc  NYSE M  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  last week ",2017-01-10,David I.

144371,365886,KSS,Are Retail Stocks Down For The Count ,opinion,"After a strong second half of 2016  the bear case for retailers unfortunately returned  Last week a slew of department stores reported preliminary holiday sales results well below prior forecasts  moving retail stocks considerably lower Thursday and Friday  The skid highlights ongoing industry wide challenges retailers face as more sales move online and squeeze profitability  Online margins tend to pale in comparison to in store margins as more stores begin offering free shipping with no purchase minimum  Making matters worse  a near certain earnings season blunder in the coming weeks leaves retail stocks vulnerable to a second selloff 
Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  made the biggest splash in the parade of same store sales  SSS  reports last week  Shares of the department store slid over 20  on a 2 1  decline in SSS for the final months of 2016  As a result  management cut full year earnings targets to a range of  2 92    2 97 from  3 12    3 32  Estimate activity for the fourth quarter started to edge lower prior to the news  reflecting the Estimize community s pessimistic outlook of department stores 
Macy s  NYSE M  suffered a similar fate to Kohl s after reporting weak holiday sales and cutting full year guidance  Management expects EPS to fall in the range of  2 95   3 10  well below its prior forecast of  3 15  3 40  Management placed blame on consumer shopping habits and the multitude of challenges facing retailers for the lackluster report  The company also shed light on its plans to close 68 stores around the U S   leaving nearly 10 000 employees out of work  Macy s expects the ongoing closures and restructuring efforts to generate  550 million in annual savings  which will be used to build out its online presence  off price concept and beauty retail 
That said  each additional closing cedes sales to its competitors thereby putting pressure on the top line  Macy s indicated that the most recent wave of closures would reduce 2017 revenue by about  575 million  The hope is that increasing the number of Bluemercury and Macy s Backstage locations will gradually offset lost sales down the road 
JC Penney  NYSE JCP  and Sears  NASDAQ SHLD  round out the list of departments stores to suffer from weak holiday sales  For JCP  a 0 8  decline in comparable store sales didn t put any significant stress on full year fiscal 2016 projections  As a discount chain  JCP effectively weathered some of the retail challenges that hurt Macy s this winter 
More broadly the entire retail space faces a serious threat to earnings from potential policies proposed by president elect Trump that would drive up the cost of imported goods  Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  is among the biggest companies to take a hit from the tax proposal  Shares of the big box retailer dropped 1 5  in the past 5 trading days 
The growing list of problems facing the overall retail sector still hasn t hit Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   In fact  its dominance was recently solidified after reports verified it was the most widely used online retailer during the holiday season 
For the remaining retailers yet to report  investors shouldn t expect the future to hold a different outcome

144389,365904,KSS,Kohl s Corp  KSS  Gains Despite Headwinds  Should We Hold ,opinion,"Despite the prevailing headwinds  Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   has exhibited a bullish run in the index over the past one year  We noted that in the said period the stock has surged 14 9  and comfortably outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail Regional Department Stores industry  which showcased growth of just 7 2   We believe there still much momentum left in the stock  which is quite evident from its  of  A  and long term earnings growth rate of 8 8  
What further makes us optimistic about its performance in the near term is its uptrend in estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has been rising over the past 30 days  Estimates rose 1 8  to  3 93 in fiscal 2017  while it increased 1 9  to  4 21 in fiscal 2018 over the past 30 days 
The retailer delivered better than expected earnings and revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 on Nov 10  amid a difficult sales scenario  In fact  the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four quarters  making for an average positive surprise of 6 2   During the third quarter  earnings increased 7  driven by better expense management  However  net sales declined 2 3  due to a challenging sales environment and soft comparable store sales KOHLS CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    We also note that Kohl s Corporation s turnaround initiative named  Greatness Agenda  is showing weakness of late  The initiative  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually  thus posing a concern  Moreover  comps declined in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016  This is raising concerns over the near term 
The company is also witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories  dwindling store traffic  competition from discount retailers and cautious consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores 
Nevertheless  we believe the concerns are short term and therefore leave space for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to rebound in the long run  The company also remains optimistic on its initiative for the long term  Further  Kohl s is making continuous efforts to improve its base business and gearing up for the holiday season 
We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat even amid difficult times  Hence  we suggest investors to hold on to the stock as the rest is a wait and watch story

144431,365946,KSS,Kohl s  KSS  Comps Still Sluggish  Should Investors Worry ,opinion,"Kohl s Corp    NYSE KSS   appears to be struggling due to sluggish comparable store sales    comps    amid a challenging retail environment in the U S 
The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 8 75  and a  of A  which signals that it has strong fundamentals and long term growth prospects  However  the company is not performing quite well over the past few quarters due to weak comps  Also  its shares have plummeted nearly 14  year to date 
Sluggish Comps
Estimates have been declining over the past 30 days period since Kohl s reported second quarter fiscal 2016 results last month  Despite posting better than expected earnings and revenues in the quarter  Kohl s slashed its fiscal 2016 earnings view due to sluggish comps and a difficult sales scenario 
Kohl s turnaround initiative named  Greatness Agenda  is showing signs of weakness lately  The initiative  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though this initiative helped the company to deliver positive comps through fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually  Moreover  comps declined in the first two quarters of fiscal 2016  which remains a concern over the near term KOHLS CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Difficult Retail Environment
We note that Kohl s is struggling since the past many quarters to boost its sluggish top line  Lower spending on apparel  dwindling store traffic  competition from discount retailers and online retailers like Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and cautious consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores  Steady migration of sales to online platforms is also hurting store sales  Kohl s remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 results and plans to close 18 stores due to retail uncertainty as well as careful spending by U S  consumers 
Higher inventory levels and operating expenses are also impacting the company s margins  In addition  unanticipated expenses related to its e commerce business are adding to its already high input costs 
However  retail stocks that are currently doing well include J C  Penny Company  Inc    NYSE JCP   and Macy s  Inc    NYSE M    Both the stocks hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Last quarter  the Israel based manufacturer of household soda makers delivered a positive earnings surprise of 93 33  
The company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 20 12  SODASTREAM INTL Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
SodaStream makes soda sparkling water machines and flavored syrups which are primarily sold at major retail stores like Kohl s Corp    NYSE KSS    Macy s and Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  
After reporting weak sales results in few past quarters due to low demand for its products  SodaStream reported strong sales and margins in the first quarter 2016  Backed by the strong first quarter performance  the company raised its full year sales and profit guidance 
The growth plan of the company  which focuses on transitioning from soda to a healthy water based brand along with building a more efficient infrastructure  gained traction in the first quarter 
As a part of the plan  the company rolled out a range of natural water enhanced flavors in the U S  and some international markets last year  The company also introduced an automated Sparkling Water Maker  named Power  supporting the launch with an integrated marketing campaign  including TV  PR and digital  as well as improved retail execution  The company s marketing efforts fuelled demand for its products in markets like France and the Nordics in the first quarter after several quarters of decline 
Also  the company has transformed its manufacturing base and operating structure   including consolidating production under the new Lehavim facility in Southern Israel and closing other legacy facilities   to improve efficiency 
The company achieved better sales and profits in the first quarter on the back of new flavors on the shelf and enhanced efficiency and operating performance from the fully functional Lehavim production facility  We expect the positive trend to continue in the second quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that SodaStream is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 19 cents

144503,366018,KSS,Will Lower Spending Dampen Kohl s  KSS  Earnings In Q2 ,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is set to report second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 11  Last quarter  this specialty retailer posted a negative surprise of 13 89  
In fact  the company has posted an average negative surprise of 2 35  in the trailing four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement KOHLS CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Consider
Kohl s is struggling since the past many quarters to boost its sluggish top line  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores 
The company remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 results and plans to close 18 stores  due to retail uncertainty as well as cautious spending by U S  consumers 
Also  Kohl s turnaround initiative named  Greatness Agenda  is showing weakness of late  The initiative  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in the first  second and third quarters of 2015 and fourth quarter 2014  after persistent declines for more than a year  the quarterly growth rates have gradually decelerated  This raises concerns  Estimates for the second quarter of 2016 have also gone down over the past 30 days

Below are these two department stores and some of the results from these recent earnings reports  as well as how they re stocks are reacting in trading today 
Macy s Inc    NYSE M  
Macy s Inc  reported their second quarter 2016 financial results this morning  and was able to post a beat on both earnings and revenue estimates  Adjusted earnings came in at  0 54 per share  much higher than the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of  0 40  Revenue figures came in higher than expected too at  5 87 billion  compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 75 billion 
The retailer also said that comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis fell 2   while on an owned basis  comparable sales fell 2 6   For the full year  Macy s now projects sales on an owned plus licensed basis to decline about 3 4   Also  as part of a store rationalization program  Macy s announced that it plans to shut down nearly 100 full line locations  Most of the closings will come in the early part of 2017 
Shares of Macy s were trading more than 13  higher in mid morning trade Thursday  Macy s is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  MACYS INC Price and EPS Surprise   Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS  
The other department store retailer that reported earnings this morning was Kohl s Corp   who reported their second quarter 2016 financial results  The company reported EPS of  1 22  coming in higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 04 by 17 3   Earnings also grew 14  year over year as higher gross margins and better expense management paid off  Revenues for the quarter also beat estimates  albeit by a small margin  Kohl s reported revenue of  4 18 billion  just above the Zacks Consensus Estimate revenue of  4 16 billion 
Same store sales declined 1 8  in the second quarter  narrower than the prior quarter s decline of 3 9   For Q2 2015 sales increased a slight 0 1   The company has tried to boost sales with its strategic initiative  Greatness Agenda   it seems as though it is not catching on like Kohl s had hoped  Kohl s also announced the slashing of its earnings guidance for the rest of the year due to sluggish same store sales and an overall difficult sales scenario  The company now expects its adjusted fiscal 2016 earnings to be in the range of  3 80 to  4 00 per share  lower than their previous guidance of  4 05 to  4 25 per share   
Shares of Kohl s were nearly 12  higher in mid morning trade Thursday  The company is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  KOHLS CORP Price and EPS Surprise   Bottom Line
Both department store retailers were able to deliver beats on both earnings and revenue estimates  though many would likely consider the results mixed as same store sales declined for both compared to Q2 of last year  Both saw their shares spike in the markets as investors apparently liked what they saw though  The brick and mortar retail scene will likely continue to be an uphill battle  but these two clearly showed that there is still hope for both of their businesses   Also Read   ",2016-08-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/who-wore-it-better-macy's-(m)-v.s.-kohl's-(kss)-department-store-q2-earnings-releases-200147492,200147492

144519,366034,KSS,5 Retail Picks To Add To Your Cart As April Sales Shoot Up ,opinion,"Following lackluster growth in the first three months of this year  retail sales have picked up in April  In fact  sales at retailers touched the highest level last month in more than a year  Gains were robust  with auto dealers  gas stations and Internet retailers left grinning  This is a welcome relief  especially after a string of discouraging results from department stores in the first quarter that raised questions about the financial health of consumers 
A steady rise in income levels is also expected to lift consumer spending  which will eventually boost retail sales in the future  Moreover  consumer confidence in the U S  has already gained strength in May  Hence  it will be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound stocks from the retail sector 
Retail Sales Post Biggest Gain in a Year
Sales at retailers jumped 1 3  in April from a month earlier  the biggest gain since Mar 2015  according to the Commerce Department on Friday  This leap in retail sales was led by gains among auto dealers  gas stations and online merchants  Demand at auto dealers moved north at the fastest pace in a year  while sales at Internet outlets were the strongest in almost two years 
Internet and catalog sales had surged more than 10  in the past year as Americans showed more of an inclination to purchase goods online  Departmental stores figures  on the other hand  sank 1 7  over the last 12 months 
Nevertheless  April s gains were broad based with 11 out of 13 major retail categories showing increases  Besides  the  core retail sales  figure that excludes cars  petrol  building materials and food services gained 0 9  in April  the most since Mar 2014  Core sales figure was also revised up 0 2  in March  which was larger than previously reported 
Auto Dealers  Gas Stations and Online Merchants Lead
Purchases at auto dealers advanced 3 2  in April  a sharp reversal from the 3 2  decline registered in the previous month  This figure was more or less in line with industry data  Sales of cars and light trucks increased at an annualized rate to 17 3 million in April  according to the Ward s Automotive Group  April s data indicated that Americans were drawn toward purchasing SUVs and pickup trucks  banking on cheaper fuel costs and low interest rates 
Gas stations posted a 2 2  increase in sales in April  In March  sales at gas stations had increased 3 1   Meanwhile  Internet and mail order sales leapt 2 1  last month  This category includes online vendors such as Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    According to Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    Amazon is now the second largest apparel seller in the U S   a category once dominated by department stores 
These e commerce giants are coming up with better results than the traditional retailers  as evident from their recent earnings reports  Nonetheless  the struggling brick and mortar department stores also posted a gain of 0 3  in sales in April 
Retailers Ringing Recession Alarm 
Traditional retailers such as Macy s  Inc    NYSE M   and Kohl s Corp    NYSE KSS   are left wondering why there is this disconnect between an improving economy and spending at their stores  Both companies have reported a drop in same store sales for the first quarter  while Kohl s profit fell below estimates as well   Macy s also slashed its outlook as sales took a plunge 
Logic  however  says that healthier household finances  as reflected by the increase in income  are expected to shore up profits for such retailers   According to the Commerce Department  personal income increased to 0 4  in March  more than the downwardly revised 0 1  in February  Based on this faster rate of income  it is expected that consumers will be able to spend more in the near term 
Wages have already grown significantly last month  Average hourly earnings ticked up 8 cents in April following a 6 cent increase the month before  Plenty of job opportunities also remain in many high paying industries and with the unemployment rate at 5   there is no immediate reason to remain concerned that the job market is souring 
Top 5 Retail Stocks to Boost Your Portfolio
As mentioned above  improvement in income will help sales at retail outlets to gain momentum in the near future  Wage growth has already propelled U S  retail sales in April  suggesting that consumers could help revive economic growth in the current quarter  U S  consumer confidence also soared to its strongest level in almost a year in May  The University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for this month came in at 95 8  way ahead of April s final reading of 89 
As the future looks good for the retail sector  supported by April s stellar performance  it will be a smart move to invest in stocks related to retail  We have selected five stocks from the retail sector that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  
However  it is important to remember that picking winning stocks may not be easy  Hence  we have narrowed down our search with a  of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners

In the first quarter  Kohl s reported earnings of 31 cents per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents by 13 9   Earnings also declined a significant 50  from the prior year quarter due to a drop in sales and lower gross margin 
  
Sales and Margins
Net sales of  3 972 billion also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 124 billion by 3 7   Sales also declined 3 7  from the prior year quarter due to a challenging sales environment  We note that this was the first drop in net sales in the last six quarters as the demand for spring apparel was hurt by unseasonably cool weather in late March and early April 
Comps declined 3 9  in the first quarter as against preceding quarter s growth of 0 4  and prior year growth of 1 4   This signals that the company s strategic initiative  Greatness Agenda  has failed to deliver results  The initiative  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in the last five consecutive quarters after persistent declines for more than a year  the quarterly growth rates have gradually gone down  which is a concern 
We note that Kohl s is struggling since the past many quarters to boost its sluggish top line  Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores 
Kohl s Corporation remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 results and plans to close 18 stores  due to retail uncertainty as well as cautious spending by US consumers 
Gross margin contracted 139 basis points  bps  to 35 5   This was expected as the company had planned to aggressively clear excessive merchandise that resulted from lower than expected fourth quarter sales  Operating margin also plunged 250 bps to 4 3  due to higher expenses 
Other Financial Details
As of Apr 30  2016  Kohl s held  423 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with  707 million as of Jan 30  2016  The company ended the quarter with long term debt of  2 79 billion  flat sequentially 
On May 11  2016  Kohl s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share  which will be paid on Jun 22  2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jun 8  2016 
Outlook
The company did not provide any guidance during the first quarter  During the fourth quarter conference call  Kohl s had stated that it will also close 18 underperforming stores in fiscal 2016  which are expected to generate annual SG A savings of approximately  45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately  10 million 
The company had also forecast earnings in a range of  4 05 to  4 25 for fiscal 2016  It expected sales in a range of  0 5   to 0 5   driven by comparable sales increase of 0  to 1 0

144531,366046,KSS,Oil To Strengthen By 2nd Half 2016,opinion,"Thursday  May 12  2016

Stocks are indicated to start today s session modestly in the green  with oil prices making gains  another weak retail sector earnings report and the weekly Jobless Claims numbers confirming the soft jobs reading from last week 

Pushing oil prices higher today is a new report from the International Energy Agency  IEA   the OECD energy watchdog  that projects the global oil inventory overhang fading notably in the second half of the year  Driving this favorable development is a combination of supply disruptions from Canada  Nigeria  Libya and other producing nations and normal production declines as a result of lower prices  The agency projects that global oil inventories will drop to about 200K barrels per day in the back half of the year from the first half s 1 3 million barrels per day in the first half 

This diminishing inventory overhang has been a key part of our favorable view of the oil space this year  We did not foresee the unplanned supply disruptions out of Canada and elsewhere  but those are temporary in any case and will eventually be back online  But it s the reduced volumes from the U S  s share basins purely on economic grounds that is proving to be the more enduring cure for the oil market s supply problems  Production declines from the shale basins have proved to be a lot slower than many of us had envisioned  but it s nevertheless happening and the trend is expected to only accelerate in the coming days despite the commodity s recent favorable momentum 
Beyond oil  Kohl s    NYSE KSS    became the latest retailer to come out with disappointing quarterly results  Macy s    NYSE M    was a big disappointment on Wednesday  This confirms our sector s earnings outlook that the clouds over traditional retailers aren t a result of how much but rather where consumers are spending their money  These retailers have not only to contend with the competitive challenge  from Amazon    NYSE M     but they still have to defend market shares from traditional competitors  Many see material over capacity in the brick and mortar retail space as well  which is making the competitive landscape all the more challenging for all legacy players

144533,366048,KSS,Kohl s Corp   KSS  Lags Q1 Earnings And Revenue,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is a U S  based department store chain that operates specialty department stores and an e commerce site in the U S  The department store appeals to middle class consumers as it sells discounted branded and private label clothing and home goods 
Kohl s has been struggling hard since more than one year  owing to a challenging retail sales environment in the U S  A general slowdown in consumer spending and a highly competitive promotional environment has also been impacting the profits  Though Kohl s continuous efforts to improve its business coupled with its strategic initiative  the Greatness Agenda  is expected to improve sales of the company over the long term  but the initiative is generating weaker returns in the near term which is a concern  Due to this  investors are eagerly awaiting Kohl s earnings report 
Investors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for KSS  as the consensus estimate has been moving downwards over the past 30 days  KSS has a mixed history in earnings season  KSS has delivered positive surprise in three of the last four quarters  with negative surprise in the remaining one  making for an average positive surprise of 3 76  
Currently  KSS has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but that could definitely change following Kohl s  earnings report which was just released  We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just revealed announcement below 
Earnings  KSS posted earnings of 31 cents per share  missing our consensus of 36 cents per share  Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses 
Revenue  KSS posted revenues of  3 972 billion  missing our consensus estimate of  4 124 billion

144560,366075,KSS,Retailers Seem To Agree With Global Manufacturing,opinion,"According to Discern Investment Analytics  the number of retail store closings in the first two months of 2016 was about a third more than the closings in the same two months last year  That s bad news just in terms of the raw increase  but more so given that there was a wave of shutting retailer outlets last year  too  Store closings in 2015 were 29  more than 2014  It s not a precise estimate of total retailer capacity being drawn down since it doesn t include absolute square footage or really the sales per square foot in those stores  but it is perhaps more relevant this year since the roster of retailers include some of the biggest like  

Last week  Men s Wearhouse said it will close a whopping 250 stores  while Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy and announced plans to close 140 stores earlier this month 
In February  Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  said it will close 18 underperforming stores  Others such as teen retailer Aeropostale Inc  NYSE ARO   with more than 900 stores  are teetering on the brink of insolvency 
While most retailers typically trim their ranks at the beginning of a new year   up to 50 percent of store closures happen around now   some industry experts say this year could be the beginning of a big shakeout 
 We are hitting a tipping point   said Richard Church  managing director of Discern Investment Analytics   We are in a weak demand environment that could meaningfully accelerate next year  

Inevitably when discussing the fortunes of retailers  the structural trend toward online shopping is offered as a counterexample of what might be a truly positive trend  If consumers are still shopping but now using smartphones instead of their feet  then that is bad news for Macys but terrific news for Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and the rest of the economy  productivity   The problem is  of course  finding the  net  shopper who is doing just that 
When analyzing the shift in consumer preferences it is usually presented as  all or nothing   meaning that shoppers leaving bricks and mortar stores are bestowed with a convenience option that they are exercising  Instead  the shift toward online may not be separable from the  weak demand environment  at all  In other words  if consumers have become fickle about bargains and finding the lowest price  that may be just as much macro economic as micro economic  It may be that online retailers are best positioned in a downward economic transition because they can offer better prices without having the burden of the huge sales distribution costs that come with operating physical stores 
That seems to be the judgment of the world s producers as this  manufacturing recession  continues on and one  When the Commerce Department reported  another contraction in wholesale sales  for January  they also included the thirteenth consecutive decline in manufacturing sales  That meant  like   these contractions are now starting to  stack   Reported sales attributed to the manufacturing level of the domestic supply chain were in January 2016 4  below January 2015  which already showed sales 4 1  below January 2014 

These estimates certainly seem very much in line with reports of retailers scaling back   as if there were a consumer recession  rather than purely manufacturing  It is an interpretation that Chinese manufacturers have been living out for some time  too  The Commerce Department also reported for January 2016 the fourth consecutive month of contraction in US imports from China  The last time that had occurred was August through November 2009  Great Recession   and prior to that June through September 2001  Dot com Recession  

If Chinese estimates of their exports are any indication  and sometimes they are not  given data disparity and questionability    the reflection of US consumer  demand  is as bad as the retailer store closing estimates  In short  there seems to be a lot of agreement on the account of a distinct lack of US demand and consumer spending  Domestic and foreign manufacturers are seeing only a persistent drop in sales which suggests that if consumers are shifting online it is not a dollar for dollar transition  Those that find their bargains on their mobile devices are pocketing the savings  buying less overall  Physical retailers may be hardest hit  with wired retailers absorbing some of the blow  but that is still overall quite negative commentary on US consumers 
And it only serves to further highlight the growing discrepancy with the employment figures  As I noted two weeks ago  the BLS estimates that there is an epic hiring binge  not layoffs  in the US retail segment  Given the information about store closings  that would have to mean Amazon and its peers hiring away all the employees from shuttered Wal Mart s  NYSE WMT and Macy s  NYSE M   and then still a lot more beyond that  all the while the sales of reported goods being sold by manufacturers here and especially China continues to shrink 
The BLS is also suggesting that US manufacturers  despite more than a year in contraction  are still hiring if only slightly  Through January 2016  the BLS actually estimates a 16k decline in manufacturing employment in February   the BLS shows that manufacturing employment is up by about 154k jobs since sales peaked in July 2014  During the similar decline of the dot com recession  manufacturing employment fell by more than 1 4 million  This does not immediately suggest that US manufacturing employment would be similarly decimated  only that perhaps the BLS has at least the sign wrong 

It is difficult to come to any other conclusion except that the BLS is overstating employment in general fashion across all industries  The  goods economy  is nothing like what the employment numbers suggest in macro terms  meaning that if there were truly a full boom in the labor market right now a manufacturing recession  complete with so many retailers cutting back  would be impossible  Spending is traced more than anything to employment and more so perceptions about the stability and permanence of employment  Friedman   Nervous consumers using online tools to cut back in spending  not to mention  savings  on gasoline  does not sketch backward to a robust jobs market  quite the opposite 
That point is emphasized in these individual economic segments where consumer doubt is directly impacting   retailers and manufacturers  foreign and domestic   Given what we interpret about a  manufacturing recession  it is not at all surprising to find so many retailers struggling to the point of bankruptcy and downsizing  If it looks like recession across so many different points of view  especially those closest to the real world rather than stochastic models  chances are very good there isn t the slightest hint of  overheating  ",2016-03-22,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/retailers-seem-to-agree-with-global-manufacturing-200122422,200122422
144561,366076,KSS,SodaStream  SODA  Q1 Earnings  Will The Stock Surprise ,opinion,"SodaStream International Ltd    NASDAQ SODA   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 10  before the market opens  Last quarter  the Israel based manufacturer of household soda makers delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41 18  

	The company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 138 45  



	Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 

Factors to Consider

	The company s sales figures have been weak in the U S  over the past few quarters due to low demand for its products like soda sparkling water machines and flavored syrups  SodaStream s products are primarily sold at major retail stores like Kohl s  Corp    NYSE KSS    Macy s and Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  

	The U S  carbonated soft drink  CSD  market is suffering as consumers are shifting away from traditional soda toward more natural  water based beverages with fewer calories  Keeping in line with this  SodaStream is pursuing a global restructuring and growth plan  The company is repositioning itself as a water based brand under a health and wellness plan and making significant changes in its growth strategies to boost business 

	As part of the aforesaid plan  the company rolled out a range of natural water enhanced flavors in the U S  and some international markets as well as an automated sparkling water maker   Power   in the last year s second half  The company is also supporting the launches with integrated marketing campaigns as well as improved retail execution 

	Also  the company is working on the transformation of its manufacturing base and operating structure   which includes consolidating production under the new Lehavim facility in Southern Israel and closing other legacy facilities   to enhance efficiency 

	The company achieved better sales trends in the fourth quarter of 2015 supported by new flavors on the shelf and the fully functional Lehavim production facility 

	We believe that the company will be able to maintain the improved sales trends in the first quarter of 2016  However  currency headwinds might limit sales growth as many foreign currencies such as Euro  Australian dollar and Swedish krona continue to weaken against the U S  dollar  Also  advertising costs are expected to go up as the company works on driving consumer demand for the new products 

Earnings Whispers

	Our proven model does not conclusively show that SodaStream is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 

Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 14 cents 

Zacks Rank  SodaStream s Zacks Rank  3 is favorable but a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 

	We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 

Stocks to Consider

	A couple of stocks in the broader consumer products sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 

	Prestige Brands Holdings  Inc    NYSE PBH   with an Earnings ESP of  4 08  and a Zacks Rank  2 

	Electronic Arts Inc    NASDAQ EA   with an Earnings ESP of  6 67  and a Zacks Rank  3 ",2016-05-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sodastream-(soda)-q1-earnings:-will-the-stock-surprise-200128541,200128541
144562,366077,KSS,Will Lower Margins Dampen Kohl s  KSS  Earnings In Q1 ,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   is set to report first quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on May 12  Last quarter  this specialty retailer posted a positive surprise of 1 94  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement 
Factors to Consider
For the first quarter of 2016  the company expects a significant drop in gross margins as the company plans to aggressively clear excessive merchandise that resulted from lower than expected fourth quarter sales  SG A expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are also expected to rise 3  to 4   mainly due to higher advertising expenses 
Kohl s remains cautious about its fiscal 2016 results and plans to close 18 stores after reporting weak fourth quarter fiscal 2015 results  due to retail uncertainty as well as cautious spending by US consumers  The company is witnessing lower spending on apparel and accessories  A general slowdown in consumer spending is also hurting sales at department stores 
Kohl s Corporation s turnaround initiative named  Greatness Agenda  is showing weakness of late  The initiative  which began in the first quarter of 2014  was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in the last five consecutive quarters after persistent declines for more than a year  the quarterly growth rates have become successively smaller  This is raising concerns over the near term  Estimates are also declining for first quarter 2016 since the past 30 days 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kohl s is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  ESP for Kohl s is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 37 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Kohl s carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the retail sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank and are therefore worth considering include

The TJX Companies  Inc    NYSE TJX   with an Earnings ESP of  1 43  and a Zacks Rank  2

144591,366106,KSS,Buy This Bargain Stock While You Still Can  KSS,opinion,"Shakespeare once implored us to  be not afraid of greatness  
And while I m sure every CEO in the world agrees in theory  not all of them follow through 
That s what makes Kevin Mansell so interesting 
He s the CEO of America s largest department store chain   and his  Greatness Agenda  has positioned the company and its 1 100 plus stores for long term success 
Yet the company s stock remains surprisingly cheap  in large part because of a  disappointing  first quarter 
Fickle investors have given us a real opportunity here  This low price isn t going to last  so don t wait too long to do some bargain shopping 
Indeed  investors may be down on Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  right now  But the underlying business looks strong 
About a year ago  Kohl s unveiled its customer centric Greatness Agenda  According to CEO Kevin Mansell   The Greatness Agenda was built on five pillars  amazing product  incredible savings  easy experience  personalized connections  and winning teams  
The first Greatness Agenda initiatives included new beauty shops in stores   as well as a new loyalty program that benefited all customers  not just Kohl s cardholders  
More recently  Kohl s implemented a buy online pick up in store program that was long overdue 
Additionally  it announced a plan to sell returned merchandise at brand new off price stores  This initiative alone could launch Kohl s cost savings into the billions  Returned items are a huge drain on most clothing retailers  Some   like Victoria s Secret   shred every item that s returned to them  If the idea takes off  Kohl s should reap huge benefits 
Considering the stock s recent trajectory  though  it appears that investors aren t seeing the light just yet 
Finding Value in the Bargain Bin
Kohl s stock took a massive 13  hit after its first quarter earnings report  For perspective  that s the largest single day drop in the stock s entire trading history  according to MarketWatch 
Yet the news wasn t as bad as a drop of that magnitude would imply 
The company reported same store sales growth of 1 4   That s good compared to the same period last year  which saw a decline of 3 4   Still  it was well below the market s expectation of 2 6  growth 
On top of that  Kohl s reported revenue of  4 12 billion  It represents a 1 3  increase from the same period last year  But it s a bit below the  4 19 billion figure analysts had predicted 
Either way  investors fled the scene immediately  which is good news for us  The current price looks like a decent entry point into KSS 
Just to make sure  though  let s take a look at Kohl s current valuation  As you ll see  it s quite appealing compared to both its competitors and the market as a whole 

Furthermore  Kohl s is trading at a significant discount to several of its own 10 year averages

Of course  we don t just want cheap stocks  We want decent yield and solid dividend growth  too 
Kohl s pays a quarterly dividend of  0 45  good for a respectable indicated yield of 2 74   And because of an extensive share buyback program  the stock has a nice total yield of 7 47  
Most recently  the company boosted the payout by more than 15   and it s grown the dividend 80  since 2011 
Finally  because of its niche  Kohl s should be able to weather any potential economic downturn better than many of its competitors  The company sells affordable clothing to middle class families  making it less prone to economic uncertainty than high end retailers like Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF  or Coach Inc  NYSE COH  
Bottom line  It s tough to find decent businesses trading at a discount these days  Thus  while Kohl s may be reeling from its poor earnings report  its current level could be an attractive entry point into a solid business

The Markets

Stocks ended lower on Friday as investors reacted to the employment report for the month on December  The number of new payrolls added for the month was a better than expected 252 000  down from the 353 000 added last month  but still showing healthy economic growth  The number that had investors concerned was the average hourly wages  which ticked lower by 0 2  for the month 
Over the past year  hourly earnings have risen a mere 1 65   inline with the pace of inflation  implying that real wage growth was absent  Inflation remains the key variable that has investors concerned  In Europe  the threat of deflation remains a probable outcome  Back in the US  inflation  as gauged by the Consumer Price Index  CPI   remains stubbornly low  well below the 2  objective set by the Fed  Looking at the Treasury Inflation Protected ETF  ARCA TIP  relative to the 7 10 Year Treasury Bond Fund  ARCA IEF   inflation expectations continue to trend lower  following the direction of commodity prices  mainly oil  Pring s Inflation Index  which seeks to replicate a group of stocks that are sensitive to inflationary conditions  is showing a similar declining trend 
A seasonal analysis on this index shows that inflationary pressures start to pick up at the end of January  running through to May  thanks to the seasonal rise in energy commodities  Evidence of a bottoming pattern in the price of oil and energy stocks continues to be sought ahead of the period of seasonal strength  which could get underway at any time now 



Declining inflation expectations and a rising US dollar continues to threaten the commodity market over the near term  however  a couple of metal commodities are showing signs of a base building pattern within their period of seasonal strength 
With the recent volatility in equity markets  Silver and Platinum have began to stabilize  attempting to halt the downward trend in prices that saw significant losses since July of last year  A double bottom with respect to the price of Silver may be becoming apparent 
Looking at the Silver ETF  ARCA SLV   support at  14 64 has held for the past couple of months  a break above short term resistance of  16 49 would imply a new intermediate uptrend  A similar pattern is evident on the chart of the Platinum ETF  NYSE PPLT   which has held support around  114  Both Silver and Platinum remain seasonally strong through to a least the end of February  benefiting from the uptick in industrial production ahead of the spring 




Typically  as investors become confident that a tradable low in commodity prices has been charted  the stocks of the producers start to outperform  The chart of the Silver Miners ETF  NYSE SIL  versus Silver  SLV  is showing a similar double bottom pattern as the producers show strength relative to the commodity  The chart of the Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDX  versus the price of Gold  ARCA GLD  is showing the same  suggesting that miners of these precious metals  whether it be Gold  Silver  or Platinum  are setup for a move higher  with the expectation that the commodities will do the same  The miners remain in a period of seasonal strength through February  similar to the commodities

Factors to Consider
Walmart has not had the best of times of late  as the company delivered weak results for five consecutive quarters due to declining comparable store sales owing to a highly volatile retail sales environment and weakness in international markets 
In the last quarter  the retail giant s earnings also declined year over year due to softer comps and high direct costs related to harsh weather conditions  Revenues increased only marginally due to unseasonably cold and disruptive weather and currency headwinds  A challenging retail environment in the U S  as well as in most international markets due to cautious consumer spending also hurt the top line in the quarter  despite growth in the e commerce business 
Walmart International has also been witnessing weakness in Mexico  Brazil and China  Walmart s international revenues grew by a mere 1  in fiscal 2014  We anticipate economic strains in the U S  and abroad to likely pressurize its low income shoppers in the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2015 as well  The company also expects macro economic headwinds like reductions in government benefits  higher taxes  tighter credit and higher group health care costs to impact results in fiscal 2015 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2015  Walmart expects its adjusted earnings to range between  1 15 and  1 25 per share  Walmart expects U S  comp sales to be relatively flat for the 13 week period ending Aug 1  as against a decline of 0 3  last year  Sam s Club comp sales  without the impact of fuel sales  are expected to remain flat compared to a 1 7  increase last year  The company expects second quarter tax rate to be at the higher end of the full year forecasted range of 32  34   The Zacks Consensus Estimates are also showing declining trend over the past 7 days for the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2015 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Walmart is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The ESP for Walmart is 0 00  as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate stand at  1 15 per share 
Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Walmart s Zacks Rank  3 when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum 
Other Stocks to Consider
Other stocks in the retail sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 
SuperValu Inc   NYSE SVU   with an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Inventure Foods Inc   NASDAQ SNAK   with an Earnings ESP of  5 56  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS   with an Earnings ESP of  1 87  and a Zacks Rank  3 ",2014-08-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-walmart-disappoint-yet-again-222589,222589
144622,366137,KSS,Here s Why Shares Of PVH Continued To Drift Higher After Jumping 9 ,opinion,"Shares of   NYSE PVH  climbed 10  higher on Thursday after the producer of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein clothing brands reporting better than expected earnings  but missed on overall sales  
In its second quarter of fiscal 2015 PVH profited  1 51 per share  topping the Estimize consensus of  1 43  The move represents an increase of 12 cents per share compared to the  1 39 reported in the same quarter of last year 

Total revenue came in at  1 976 billion  up 1  from the  1 965 billion reported in the same quarter of last year  Although overall sales were mostly flat  Tommy Hilfiger was an exceptionally strong brand throughout the quarter  its revenue increased by 9  
In addition to posting stronger than expected profits in the second quarter  PVH management also reaffirmed its optimistic guidance for the remainder of the year  The company is expecting full year earnings per share to fall between  7 30 and  7 40  up roughly 4 5  compared to calendar 2013  PVH must be anticipating a robust 3rd and 4th quarter to achieve those results after profits fell 23  on a year over year basis in the first quarter of the year 

Although sales were lower than predicted the strong bottom line performance at PVH rubbed off on department stores and retail stocks too  On Thursday   NYSE M  stock was up over 1     NYSE KSS  was up 2   and   NYSE JCP  shares spiked over 5  higher 

At Estimize we crowdsource expectations from the buy side and independent contributors to come up with an earnings consensus that is more honest than the traditional sell side analysts who have a habit of setting the bar too low  In June the Estimize community had predicted earnings that were way above the Street s consensus  When PVH narrowly missed the Wall Street number  the company s stock got hammered and dropped 8  
After being disappointed last quarter  contributing analysts on Estimize were more in line with the Street this time around  When PVH crushed the market s expectations  the stock took off like a rocket ship 

 Graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings 
After a company beats the Estimize earnings consensus  on average that stock tends to drift higher over the next 3 days of trading  This drift is independent from the interday gap before the market reopens  News of strong earnings at PVH had a positive impact across retail  but the PVH Corp  was still the big winner on the day  The price of PVH stock initially jumped  9 41 higher when the market opened before drifting an additional  1 88  1 5   to the upside throughout the rest of the day  The post earnings drift from Thursday is highlighted above

144627,366142,KSS,3 Retail Stocks That Outperformed Wal Mart In 2014,opinion,"The retail sector had a roller coaster ride in 2014  Most of the retailers got off to a weak start in 2014 due to a harsh winter which resulted in store shutdowns and disrupted shopping 

Though weather conditions and the job scenario improved in the second quarter  the overall economic environment remained sluggish due to lower consumer demand  The heavily promotional environment forced big brick and mortar retailers to offer discounts to stay relevant even as they dealt with the growing shift to online sales 

A volatile retail sales environment and lower consumer confidence adversely impacted traffic at retailers like Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS   Macy s Inc  NYSE M   GameStop Corp  NYSE GME  and Myers Industries Inc  NYSE MYE  in 2014 

However  the challenges for Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT  were far more than seasonal  Weak comparable store sales for more than a year shattered Wal Mart inside out  After six weak quarters in a row  Wal Mart s third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings came in line with estimates  while revenues were better than expected  However  the company again disappointed its investors by narrowing its earnings guidance for fiscal 2015 

The weak guidance reflected higher investments in e commerce and higher U S  health care costs  apart from incremental investments in Sam s Club and volatile tax rates  Not only this  but also currency headwinds  cuts in food stamps  pressure to increase minimum wages  and sluggish economic environment are expected to hurt the top line in the upcoming quarters   Read   

Also  in order to compete with online retailers like Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN   the company has been making huge investments in the e commerce business  This in turn will hurt profit margin in the upcoming quarters owing to shipping costs and price competition involved in it 

However  there were retailers which managed to beat expectations and outperform Wal Mart in each sense in spite of a slowdown in China  turmoil in Russia  sluggishness in Japan and a struggling Europe 

3 Retail Stocks Which Performed Better Than Wal Mart

Here  we have identified 3 stocks with an impressive Zacks Rank  positive  and long term EPS growth rate of above 9   These have posted impressive results in the past one year and have potential to outperform in 2015 

Shoe Carnival  LONDON CCL   Inc  is a value oriented retailer of family footwear  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company posted solid earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 last month and also provided an impressive guidance for the full year  The company also expects positive year over year earnings growth for the fourth quarter 

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter also reflects an increase of 200  year over year  This Indiana based stock has an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and is expected to report fourth quarter results on Mar 19 

Shoe Carnival currently trades at a forward P E  price to earnings  multiple of 20 29x  lower than the peer average of 20 92x and has a long term earnings growth rate of 12  

CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  has an Earnings ESP of  0 83  and is expected to report its fourth quarter 2014 results on Feb 10  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2014 indicates an increase of 7 6  year over year 

This Woonsocket  RI based provider of integrated pharmacy health care services in the U S  has succeeded in delivering superior health care services to people and registered an average positive earnings surprise of 0 4  over the trailing last four quarters  The company has a long term earnings growth rate of 13 8  

Pittsburgh  PA based American Eagle Outfitters Inc  NYSE AEO  is a specialty retailer of clothing  accessories  and personal care products  The company posted record third quarter fiscal 2014 results in Dec 2014 on higher margins attributable to the company s cost reduction initiatives 

In addition  very recently  the company raised its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014  scheduled to be reported on Mar 10  owing to solid holiday sales  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 indicates an increase of 18 5  year over year 

American Eagle Outfitters has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of  3 13   The company registered an average positive earnings surprise of 1 9  over the trailing last four quarters  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 30   Though the stock looks a bit pricey with a forward P E  price to earnings  multiple of 24 93x  higher than the peer average of 17 29x  this should not bother investors given the company s strong fundamentals 

Our Take

2014 is gone and the year 2015 looks promising for retailers as they see gradual recovery in the housing market  a strengthening manufacturing sector  an improving labor market and falling gasoline prices  We believe this would help the retail stocks take center stage ",2015-01-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-retail-stocks-that-outperformed-wal-mart-in-2014-238008,238008

144635,366150,KSS,Retailers Under Pressure,opinion,"Many of today s leading retail stocks have come under early selling pressure  It s important to follow the retail sector as it s usually a decent gauge for U S  consumer spending  Remember  U S  consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of the gross domestic product  GDP  in the United States  Today s weak retail stocks are telling us that consumer spending is waning   Some of the leading retail stocks that are declining today include The TJX Companies Inc   NYSE TJX   Wal Mart Stores Inc   NYSE WMT   Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD  and Kohl s Corporation  NYSE KSS  
Short term day traders should watch for intra day support on TJX stock around the  58 60 level  WMT stock should have decent intra day support around the  70 level  Both of these stocks could see intra day bounces from these levels ",2014-04-09,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retailers-under-pressure-209164,209164
