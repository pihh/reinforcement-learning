8951,230466,CBRL,Will Chipotle s  CMG  Dominance Continue With Its Q3 Earnings Report  ,opinion,"Chipotle   NYSE CMG   is set to report its third quarter results after the closing bell Tuesday  October 22  The restaurant giant s shares have nearly doubled in 2019  rising 92 9  and easily outpacing industry peers like Cracker Barrel   NASDAQ CBRL    Starbucks   NASDAQ SBUX    and McDonald s   NYSE MCD   

The company s impressive run in 2019 is thanks  in part  to the growth initiatives CMG has undergone to drive traffic  Chipotle s innovation has helped get it back to the growth stock it had been before a two plus year selloff 
Let s take a look at what has fueled the company s recent performance and how Chipotle might perform in Q3 
Brian Niccol Spices Things Up 
In February of 2018  Chipotle appointed former Taco Bell   NYSE YUM   head  Brian Niccol  as its new CEO  replacing founder and chairman Steve Ells  The move came after Chipotle was not where it wanted to be and struggled to restructure its brand after E  Coli outbreaks linked to its food tarnished its reputation with consumers  Niccol was able to rejuvenate the company and brand through his innovative initiatives 
Chipotle has ramped up its menu innovation by adding items like queso  chorizo  and recently carne asada  The company is actively thinking of new things to add to the menu that will keep consumers coming back to try the latest add on  Analysts believe the carne asada addition should drive the average transaction ticket up  which should bode well for the company in its final quarter of the year 
With Niccol at the helm  Chipotle has also ramped up its digital presence  which has driven its same store sales to the strong levels they are at today  The rollout of its rewards program was also a catalyst for the growth in comp sales  Digital sales were up 99 1  year over year in Q2 and accounted for 18 2  of total sales  Further highlighting how rapidly digital sales have grown for Chipotle  last quarter s digital sales were equal to all of its digital sales for the entire year of 2016 
Outlook 
Apart from its carne asada rollout  Chipotle made headlines this week by offering to cover 100  of tuition for 75 different types of business and technology degrees through a partnership with Guild Education  one of the leading education benefits companies in the country 
Chipotle s commitment to paying employees  tuition ties the employee to chipotle for the years required to earn the degree  This employee commitment helps Chipotle hold onto employees in a tight job market where companies like Target   NYSE TGT   and Walmart   NYSE WMT   compete for the labor force 
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast Chipotle s earnings to surge 46 3  to  3 16 per share on the back of a 12 65  sales increase to  1 38 billion  Our  anticipate same store sales to grow 9 44   Looking ahead to CMG s full fiscal 2019 figures  estimates project earnings to soar 47 68  to  13 38 per share while revenue jumps 12 9  to  5 49 billion  Meanwhile  fiscal 2019 comp sales are precited to pop 9 1  
Takeaway  
Chipotle s new CEO has been able to substantially grow the business  digital presence to help revive the company from the ground up  Its menu innovations have also kept consumers coming back  Chipotle is currently testing a quesadilla that has been received well in its test runs  Plus  the oven used to make the quesadillas can lead to more items like nachos and desserts 
The restaurant giant s commitment to pay for eligible employee s college tuition should help it retain a solid and loyal workforce for the foreseeable future  Chipotle s stock is currently trading around 3  below its 52 week high of over  857 per share  and a solid quarterly report may send the stock to a new high 
CMG s earning estimate revisions have trended higher recently to help Chipotle earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

9035,230550,CBRL,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Domino s Pizza  Wendy s  Brinker International  Dave   Buster s Entertainment And Cracker Barrel Old Country Store,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   April 4  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Restaurants  Part 3  including Domino s Pizza   NYSE DPZ    The Wendy s Company   NASDAQ WEN    Brinker International   NYSE EAT    Dave   Buster s Entertainment   NASDAQ PLAY   and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store   NASDAQ CBRL   Industry  Restaurants  Part 3Link  The restaurant industry has been troubled by soft consumer spending environment over the past few quarters  Although the current economic backdrop is favorable with rise in in wages  jobless claims at a record low and upbeat consumer confidence  the benefits have not trickled down to the restaurant space yet The net result is an extended period of negative comps  sluggish traffic along with rising costs  Below we discuss some of the headwinds that restaurant stocks faced and will continue to face in the near and midterm These issues have been weighing on the industry s stock market performance lately as well  which has been a tad below the S P 500 index s recent performance  Stocks in the Zacks Restaurants industry are currently down  3 5  this year  compared to the  3 2  decline for the S P 500 index and the flat performance for the Zacks Retail sector of which the Restaurant industry is a part Expenses Continue to ClimbA difficult operating environment has forced restaurant operators to increase comps and sales initiatives  which has led to an increase in costs  Rising costs have been weighing on margins for companies like Domino s Pizza  The Wendy s Company and Brinker International  Though these initiatives offer long term advantages  related costs are expected to continue in the near term  Additionally  resorting to discounting and value bundling further puts pressure on casual dining operators  already tight operating margins Moreover  restaurants like Dave   Buster s Entertainment and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store intend to make additional unit openings going forward  Thus  higher marketing and pre opening costs are expected to hurt profits Also  there has been considerable debate in the recent past over restaurant workers  wages  Workers at quick service restaurants claim that their employers  profits have not translated into substantial hike in their pay  resulting in strikes for wage hikes  These incidents significantly hurt the reputation of restaurants  As a result  the companies have been compelled to make minimum wage increases  which again lead to narrower margins  Moreover  higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue to keep profits under pressure Meanwhile  increasing cost of turnover poses a serious challenge for restaurant operators  As the economy keeps improving and employment levels rise  there is more competition for qualified employees to fill vacant restaurant positions  Restaurant management turnover is a critical headwind for operators as turnover rates continue to rise  per a report by TDn2K s  This is further compelling restaurants to either hike wages or provide benefits  at the cost of margins  to retain or attract employees Weak Comps and Low TrafficIn the past few quarters  consumer behavior has been volatile and their willingness to spend  especially on eating out  is showing signs of decline  Most of the restaurant companies are thus bearing the brunt of soft comps and traffic trends  Foot traffic declined 3 2  in 2017 and thereafter 3  and 3 1   in January and February of 2018 respectively Same store sales that account for traffic declined 2 2   1 6  and 1   respectively  in the first three quarters of 2017  Although the fourth quarter witnessed a positive same store growth of 0 4   the metric fell 0 3  in January and 0 8  February  per TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence The chief reason for the drop in same store sales is an increase in the number of new restaurants amid limited growth in eating out budgets as well as increased pressure from grocery stores  Supply glut and limited demand are hampering traffic as well as stock prices for restaurants  Instead of generating added sales  each new restaurant is eating up share from others  This has resulted in

9050,230565,CBRL,Starbucks  SBUX  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 25  after the closing bell In the preceding quarter  the company s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In fact  the coffee chain giant reported in line results on earnings in the trailing four quarters  However  the company failed to meet the consensus estimate for revenues in each of the trailing four quarters Nonetheless  we expect Starbucks  earnings to increase in the to be reported quarter banking on higher revenues  lower tax rate and share repurchases  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Factors at PlayThe company s top line is likely to experience a noticeable boost in the to be reported quarter on the back of higher revenues from new store additions  expansion in China  positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth and higher revenues from its business segments In fiscal 2018  Starbucks expects to expand globally by adding 2 300 net new locations  excluding Teavana closures   marking an increase from roughly 2 250 net new locations in fiscal 2017  Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s total stores of 27 821  as of Dec 2017  reflects 8 1  year over year growth Again  in order to boost its comps growth  Starbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages  refreshment  health and wellness  tea and core food offerings  The company holds a leading position in digital  card  loyalty and mobile capabilities  Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams  Starbucks projected global comp growth at 3 5  for fiscal 2018 The company has also been streamlining its business and directing investments toward operations where growth prospects and returns are the greatest  For this  Starbucks will acquire the remaining 50  of its East China operations  refranchise 700 company owned restaurants in Singapore  Germany  and Taiwan  and close Teavana stores and its e commerce platform  Although these efforts will benefit the company in the long run  it will likely impact Starbucks  revenues in fiscal first quarter Overall  for the fiscal first quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  6 15 billion  implying 7 2  year over year growth Segment Wise  Starbucks  Americas segment revenues  inclusive of the United States  Canada and Latin America  comprising 70  of its total revenues  is expected to witness 8 3  growth year over year and 9 4  sequentially  per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues in the China Asia Pacific segment are likely to witness 12 8  year over year and 1 2  growth sequentially  Channel Development is projected to report revenues of  588 million  higher than  554 million in the year ago quarter and  515 million in the preceding one  Additionally  the consensus estimate for Europe  Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of  283 million indicates an increase from  262 million in the year ago quarter and  270 million in the prior quarter Meanwhile  apart from higher revenues  lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings  Starbucks expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 27   including approximately 6 points of favorable impact from the planned acquisition of East China  The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33 2  Again  the company has 80 3 million of shares remaining authorized for repurchase  as of Oct 1  2017  under its ongoing share repurchase program  Hence  share repurchases will help earnings per share to grow more each quarter  However  these positives are likely to be partly offset by lower margins owing to the costs associated with restructuring its operation  Overall  for the fiscal first quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 57 cents  reflecting a 9 6  year over year increase All these positive factors have aided the company to post higher earnings despite the tepid comps and are also reflected in the price movement of the company  Shares of the company have rallied almost 13   outperforming the broader  s growth of 9 2  in the last three months Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts Starbucks does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   to increase the odds of an earnings beat You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  Starbucks has an Earnings ESP of  0 24  Zacks Rank  Starbucks

9057,230572,CBRL,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Domino s Pizza  Wendy s Company  Brinker International  Cracker Barrel Old Country Store And Dave   Buster s Entertainment,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 30  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Restaurants  including Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE DPZ    The Wendy s Company   NASDAQ WEN    Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT    Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc    NASDAQ CBRL   and Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   Industry  Restaurants  Part 3Link  Troubles simmering in the U S  restaurant industry over the past few quarters are known to all  This is reflected in the industry s recent stock market performance as well  which has lagged the broader market in the year to date period Stocks in the Zacks Restaurant industry are up  12 1  this year  which compares to a  17 7  gain for the S P 500 index in the year to date period  Negative comps as a result of sluggish traffic  along with rising costs  are the contributing factors to this underperformance Below we discuss some of the downsides hampering the restaurant industry High Expenses  Higher payroll expenses and costs related to various comps and sales boosting initiatives along with restaurant re imaging expenses are hurting margins for companies like Domino s Pizza  Inc   The Wendy s Company and Brinker International  Inc  Though these initiatives offer long term advantages  the costs related to them are expected to continue to dampen margins in the near term  Additionally  resorting to more discounting and value bundling might further put pressure on casual dining operators  already tight operating margins Moreover  restaurants like Brinker  Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc  and Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc  intend to make additional unit openings going forward  Thus  higher marketing and pre opening costs associated with the same are expected to hurt profits Also  there has been considerable debate in the recent past over restaurant workers  wages  Workers at quick service restaurants claim that their employers  profits have not trickled down to them proportionately  which is leading to strikes for wage hikes  These incidents significantly hurt the reputation of restaurants  As a result  the companies are compelled to make minimum wage increases  which again lead to narrower margins  Moreover  higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue to keep profits under pressure Additionally  recruitment and retention of employees has emerged as a top challenge for restaurant operators  As the economy keeps improving and employment levels rise  there is more competition for qualified employees to fill vacant restaurant positions  Meanwhile  restaurant management turnover is a critical headwind for operators as turnover rates continue to rise  as per a report by TDn2K s  This is further compelling restaurants to either hike wages or provide benefits  at the cost of margins  to retain or attract employees Comps Under Pressure  Over the past few quarters  consumer behavior has been volatile and their willingness to spend on most goods  especially eating out  is showing signs of decline  which is resulting in low consumption  This is because  along with wage growth  inflation is also on the rise  which translates into lower real income and thus less disposable income  The situation has taken a turn for the worse  thanks to higher health care costs and tightened credit availability in the United States Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  grocery stores are being forced to decrease their food prices to remain competitive  This is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices Most of the restaurateurs are thus bearing the brunt of soft comps trends  In fact  the third quarter of 2017 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  per a report by TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  Given the persistent negative comps trend  there has been a lot of buzz over the restaurant industry hitting recession But it is to be noted that the chief reason for the drop in same store sales is a significant decline in traffic  In fact  per market analysts  diners are spending more per visit instead of visiting chain restaurants more often  which is hurting traffic  An increased number of new restaurants amid limited growth in eating out budgets as well as increased pressure from grocery stores add to the woes  Also  increases in menu prices are at times preventing people from dining out  This unwillingness of Americans to dine out is thus pulling down restaurateurs  sales Slowdown in New Restaurant Openings  As the operating environment has become increasingly challenging  the decline in sales volumes have begun to impact the returns on new restaurant openings  As a result  some of the restaurants are slowing down their development plans Follow us on Twitter   Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research is under common

9082,230597,CBRL,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Domino s Pizza  The Wendy s Company  Brinker International  Cracker Barrel Old Country Store And Dave   Buster s Entertainment ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 17  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Restaurants  part 3  including Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE   NYSE DPZ       The Wendy s Company  NASDAQ   NASDAQ WEN       Brinker International  Inc   NYSE   NYSE EAT      Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ CBRL      and Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ PLAY      Industry  Restaurants  part 3Link  The restaurant industry s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained given the soft consumer spending environment  This makes it prudent for investors to take a closer look at the dampeners threatening growth in the restaurant industry  Particularly  negative comps  given sluggish traffic along with rising costs  are taking the sheen out of restaurateurs These headwinds are a major reason for the industry s sub par stock market performance lately  with stocks in the Zacks Restaurant Industry up 5  over the past year  underperforming the S P 500 index s  12 8  gain Below we discuss some of the downsides hampering the restaurant industry High Expenses  Costs related to various comps and sales boosting initiatives along with restaurant re imaging expenses are hurting margins for companies like Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE       The Wendy s Company  NASDAQ      and Brinker International  Inc   NYSE       Though these initiatives offer long term advantages  the costs related to them are expected to continue to dampen margins in the near term  Additionally  resorting to more discounting and value bundling might further put pressure on casual dining operators  already tight operating margins Moreover  restaurants like Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc   NASDAQ      and Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc   NASDAQ      intend to make additional unit openings going forward  Thus  higher marketing and pre opening costs associated with the same are expected to hurt profits Also  there has been considerable debate in the recent past over restaurant workers  wages  Workers at quick service restaurants claim that their employers  profits have not trickled down to them proportionately  which is leading to strikes for wage hikes  These incidents significantly hurt the reputation of restaurants  As a result  the companies are compelled to make minimum wage increases  which again lead to narrower margins  Moreover  higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue to keep profits under pressure Meanwhile  recruitment and retention of employees has emerged as a top challenge for restaurant operators in 2017  As the economy keeps improving and employment levels rise  there is more competition for qualified employees to fill vacant restaurant positions  Meanwhile  restaurant management turnover is a critical headwind for operators as turnover rates are now nearing a 10 year high  as per TDn2K s People Report  This is further compelling restaurants to either hike wages or provide benefits  at the cost of margins  to retain or attract employees Soft Comps   Traffic Trends  Over the past few quarters  consumer behavior has been volatile and their willingness to spend on most goods  especially eating out  is showing signs of decline  Most of the restaurateurs are thus bearing the brunt of soft comps and traffic trends  In fact  the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comparable sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  per a report by TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  Given the persistent negative comps trend  there has been a lot of buzz about the restaurant industry hitting recession But it is to be noted that the chief reason for the drop in same store sales is an increased number of new restaurants amid limited growth in eating out budgets as well as increased pressure from grocery stores  Moreover  per market analysts  diners are spending more per visit instead of visiting chain restaurants more often  which is hurting traffic  Also  increase in menu prices is at times preventing them from dining out  This unwillingness of Americans to dine out is thus pulling down restaurateurs  sales Slowdown in New Restaurant Openings  As the operating environment has become increasingly challenging  the decline in sales volumes have begun to impact the returns on new restaurant openings  As a result  some of the restaurants are slowing down their development plans for 2017 Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification  health insurers are broadly

9085,230600,CBRL,Cracker Barrel Counter Challenges With Initiatives  Cost Cuts,opinion,On Sep 14  we issued an updated research report on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc    NASDAQ CBRL   Notably  Cracker Barrel s distinctiveness in the retail restaurant space lies in the fact that apart from serving food  its restaurant establishments have old country feel along with unique gift shops This week  the company posted mixed fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while the top line lagged the same Key Growth DriversIn fourth quarter fiscal 2016  Cracker Barrel had launched its new fast casual concept  Holler   Dash Biscuit House  with operating hours limited to breakfast and lunch time  This new concept is expected to add considerably to the top line and boost shareholder value over the long term  Also  the company plans to expand its long standing brand s footprint in new and developing markets  In fact  continuous expansion plans of the company reinstate our belief in the brand s demand across the country We note that Cracker Barrel relies heavily on seasonal promotions and limited time offers to boost its top line performance because they are appealing to both regular users and less frequent guests  Going forward  the company aims to continue investing in new product news that will drive business frequency In fiscal 2018  the company aims to meet consumers  need for convenience via growth in its off premise business  Moreover  it has also been testing an enhanced everybody value platform at breakfast  lunch and dinner to further engage as a value player in the restaurant space  Coming to menu innovation  Cracker Barrel plans to introduce a new coffee platform this year  which should further boost check averages On the retail side  the company is likely to increase its emphasis on value to better compete in a very promotional environment  grow its sales gap and achieve its long term business growth  Thus  in fiscal 2018  along with the affordability of its merchandise offerings  the company will also be working on the quality and exclusivity of its assortments  placing greater emphasis on price value relationship Meanwhile  in a bid to address the challenges of the competitive restaurant industry  Cracker Barrel is undertaking extensive marketing efforts  mainly focused on the brand s differentiation  menu offering and its value  In fact  the company expects its extensive advertising and marketing efforts to favor sales mix in the near term This apart  Cracker Barrel also has an effective cost cutting mechanism in place and undertakes various measures to keep costs under control  All these efforts coupled with ongoing commodity cost deflation helped it to achieve its target of removing  50 million in annual cost from the business by fiscal 2017 end as outlined in fiscal 2014  These initiatives are expected to aid the company in combating some of the wage inflation pressures as well   Consequently  Cracker Barrel expects to deliver between  7 million and  8 million in annual cost savings for fiscal 2018 ChallengesCurrently  the company operates 645 Cracker Barrel outlets and five Holler   Dash Biscuit House locations across 44 states in the United States  In fiscal 2018  it expects to open eight or nine new Cracker Barrel stores and three or four new Holler   Dash Biscuit House restaurants However  Cracker Barrel loses out in terms of international presence  While the other restaurant chains like Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM    McDonalds Corporation   NYSE MCD   and Papa John s International  Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   are following aggressive global expansion policies  Cracker Barrel seems to be weak on this front Furthermore  a soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space might continue to affect traffic  Meanwhile  management notes that Cracker Barrel s retail business has been affected by the challenges faced by the retail industry  as a whole  Thus  given the continued challenges facing the restaurant and retail industry  the company s top line is likely to remain under pressure Additionally  higher labor costs along with expenses related to various sales boosting initiatives as well as opening of new units are anticipated to continue hurting margins Resultantly  Cracker Barrel s shares have declined 10 7  year to date  as against 6 5  growth of the  it belongs to Bottom LineGoing forward  we expect the company s enhanced focus on convenience  value and menu innovation along with cost cutting initiatives to help fight revenue and cost woes Cracker Barrel carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside

9103,230618,CBRL,These 5 Restaurant Companies Have Got It Right ,opinion,"This year hasn t been a great one for restaurants    not by a long shot  They have been hit on the revenue line as well as on the profit line  Moreover  despite higher employment  lower oil prices and growing GDP  all of which indicate more disposable income  footfall remains a major issue for most 
So What Could Be Going Wrong 
Health and fitness experts have been going on for years and it s finally sinking in that we should be extra cautious about what we eat and pay attention to how it s prepared  So cut out that salt and that sugar please  and make sure it s grass fed beef and free range chicken  Also  how about showing me that it s all freshly baked  fried or cut  Oh  and did you know that beans are actually so nutritious  Good for vegetarians like me  because finally  vegetarian doesn t mean under nourished 
All this is great for the younger generation when they are eager to show difference as a sign of independence  Everyone s been through those years  But imagine what it means for restaurants that have built their business around convenience  speed  indulgence  etc  It s practically a war between food at home and food away from home  Thank god for those demanding careers that make it more difficult to cook at home 
Jokes apart  this problem is not going away  The goal for restaurants is to look for opportunities within this philosophy  one of which would be snacking  Weight watchers and fitness freaks are often advised to eat small meals all through the day  This is a big positive for restaurants because smaller portion sizes would mean lower input cost that can mean bigger profits 
Second  you get to sell a larger number of meals  Third  it is a fact that controlling cravings lead to binge eating every now and then  which is something you can capitalize on  For example  a recent study found that while millenials wouldn t recommend fast food restaurants like McDonalds   NYSE MCD   and wouldn t talk about their visits to the places  they continue to frequent them 
Declining cost of groceries is a double edged sword for restaurants because on the one hand  it means lower input cost  but on the other  it makes home cooked meals more affordable  So it isn t just Gen Y shying away from restaurants  but also anyone else that can cook and has the time to do it     
The other major problem stems from the higher minimum wage and overtime laws that a number of states have adopted  This has increased costs for restaurants at a time when traffic is anyway on a decline  forcing them to raise prices  Higher prices are a big turnoff  especially for lunch customers because the lunch hour is not a very big period and people may need to squeeze in other jobs into the time as well  So they don t want to spend too much time or money on a meal they re not planning to wind down with 
An NPD report from earlier this year said that higher prices were having a serious impact on lunch traffic  which makes up a third of total traffic  Other than prices  NPD also found that more people working from home and shopping online were resulting in a smaller number of office goers and shoppers  which were impacting restaurant traffic in the afternoons 
Restaurants Need to Invest in Technology
Like it or not  technology is too much a part of our lives now  Most people that shop online are also attracted by other things they can do online and that includes ordering food  While taste is and has always been an important factor  when you re ordering online  you may also have a bit of time to research food  This gives restaurants a chance to put across their unique selling points  Partnering with online ordering and delivery companies  or even Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   helps restaurants generate a feedback system wherein customers can vote for the place and write recommendations thus driving sales   
What s Going for Restaurants Now 
Despite the many problems the segment is facing now  it s important to remember that certain restaurants have become part of our culture  so they aren t going away  Also  the older we get  the more we revert to familiar tastes and experiences  with some moderation of course   There are also new restaurants coming up to fill in the gaps created by changing perceptions and choices  which create interesting opportunities for investment 
The five restaurant stocks I ve picked look good right now because they have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   you can also see    My picks also carry a VGM Score A or B  meaning that value  growth or momentum investors wouldn t be disappointed   a positive surprise history and reasonable valuation  So read on

Potbelly Corporation is a neighborhood sandwich shop concept  While the main focus is on sandwiches  which are sold through its 396 Potbelly Sandwich Works shops across 28 states  the company also sells salads  soups  chili  chips  cookies  ice cream and smoothies  Of these  372 shops are company operated while 24 are franchisee operated  The company also has 12 internationally franchised shops  of which 11 are in the Middle East and 1 is in the UK 
A typical quick service restaurant  QSR  offers a simple menu using standard ingredients that can be served up in high volume and at cheaper prices  But customers are reluctant to sacrifice quality for price at all times  which actually means that they want the best of both worlds  This has led to smaller chains that attempt to fill this gap  such as Potbelly  Culver s  Chick fil A  Freddy s Frozen Custard   Steakburgers  El Pollo Loco  In N Out Burger and Pita Pit 
With eating at home getting much cheaper and healthier  the only reasons to eat out are convenience and desire for most  That s why QSRs that have traditionally touted price as a lure to increase footfall are taking it on the chin  This environment is more favorable for the emerging category that some have called QSR Plus  i e  not as expensive as fast casual but offering better quality than QSR     
An additional growth factor for Potbelly is its catering business  which at 14 15  of sales and growing double digits  can become an important driver of its business  Investments in digitization will drive millenials  digital menu boards to facilitate in shop messaging and a new and improved app will likely be launched soon  
On the cost front  the company expects to pilot a new system of hourly wages early next year in the hopes of mitigating the impact of rising wages

9104,230619,CBRL,Restaurant Stocks That Could Be The Next Dave   Buster s,opinion,Restaurant stocks have failed to find favors with investors so far in 2016   As a result  most of the restaurateurs have been grappling with sluggish comps and soft traffic growth Also  the Zacks Industry Rank for the Retail Restaurants industry currently stands at  156  This puts the industry in the bottom 41   corresponding to a negative outlook However  while the restaurant industry is struggling through its worst year since the end of recession  there are some big players that seem to be untroubled by the ordeal  One such company is Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY   that got listed in Oct 2014 and has exceeded expectations each time since We note that the company s shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail  Food   Restaurant industry year to date  While the stock gained 36 6   the broader market has witnessed a modest gain of 0 4  over the same time frame  In fact  since the launch of its IPO  shares of the company gained nearly 190   Propelling this multi year stretch of outperformance is the company s unique business style and its strategic initiatives Therefore  notwithstanding a long list of apprehensions  there are a few other restaurant stocks as well that are expected to follow Dave   Buster s footsteps  all of which carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see  Other Prospective WinnersDemand for pizza is hardly ever going to go down and pizza giants are riding high on this assurance  Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE DPZ   and Papa John s International  Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   are two such Zacks Rank  2 companies that reign the quick service restaurant space Both these widely loved companies need no introduction as far as their scale of operations and market presence is concerned  Both these companies  strong digital ordering platforms  international expansion story and sales boosting initiatives are likely to drive revenues and earnings  going forward Notably  while Domino s outperformed the broader industry year to date  with growth nearing 51  compared with 0 4  of the latter  Papa John s witnessed growth of above 58  Moreover  Papa John s has delivered the highest return on equity compared to its peers in the trailing 12 months  providing a return of 4985  Both the companies also carry a Growth Style Score of  A   Back tested results show that stocks with Growth Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space Upward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock s prospects going forward  For Papa John s  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 and 2017 has climbed 2 5  and 1 5   respectively  over the last 60 days  Further  for full year 2016  EPS is expected to grow a healthy 19 9   while sales growth is projected to be 4 93  Similarly  Domino s prospects also seem bright  Estimates for 2016 and 2017 have climbed 2 9  and 4 5   respectively  over the last 60 days  Also  for full year 2016  EPS is expected to grow 23 1   while sales growth is likely to be 9 7  Adding to these great growth stories is another pick of ours  The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE    carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Headquartered in Calabasas Hills  CA  it operates many upscale  high volume casual dining restaurants  Notably  Cheesecake Factory restaurants have posted positive comps in 27 consequent quarters  Going forward  various initiatives to boost sales and traffic volumes coupled with menu innovation should

functional items  setting it apart from other restaurant outlets  Moreover  the company s excellent margins  historic return on equity delivered  and consistently strong revenue growth story make it a great pick  Some key stats to note are Performance year to date  32  growth  almost consistently outperforming the industryChange in Full Year Estimate Revision  over 30 days   2 1 Change in Next Year

effective sales initiatives undertaken by the companies should keep it going  We expect the industry to get its groove back going ahead  and thus investors should not shy away from investing in this

9105,230620,CBRL,5 Stock Earnings Releases To Watch Tomorrow,opinion,"Macy s Inc  NYSE M   Macy s efforts to lift financial performance include focusing on price optimization  inventory management  merchandise planning and private label offerings  But the primary drivers lately have been its ecommerce and off price business  Macy s backstage  that continue to keep the Macy s brand afloat  Furthermore the company plans on shutting the door on over 100 unprofitable stores to maintain modest margins  Meanwhile  there is ongoing pressure for Macy s to spin off its real estate into a REIT  a move believed to be worth billions and provide an injection of capital
With that in mind  the competitive retail landscape following Amazon com s  NASDAQ AMZN  onslaught on the industry continues to pressure traffic and top line performance  Macy s already indicated that the holiday season fell short of initial expectations  Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis fell 2 1  while owned basis decreased 2 7  during the final two months of 2016 
Walmart  NYSE WMT   In the past 6 months shares of Walmart tumbled about 5 5  owing to Trump s rhetoric surrounding immigrant workers and a border tax  both of which would severely hamper financial performance  Walmart currently employs 2 3 million associates worldwide  many of which hold an immigrant status  while also offering everyday low prices  largely due to overseas production and manufacturing  Any comments or insights on the new administration s impact on future quarterly results will break investors historically indifference to an earnings report 
Otherwise  Walmart continues to work tirelessly to modernize its brick and mortar stores and expand the online platform  The acquistion of Jet com in the past 6 months should theoretically close the gap on Amazon s dominance in online retail  But most analysts don t believe the combination of Walmart and now Jet will make any meaningful progress at catching Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
On a constant currency basis  ecommerce sales grew 20 6  with gross merchandise value up 16 8  in the third quarter  both reflecting a continued acceleration from previous quarters  This contributed to a 2 5  increase in domestic Walmart sales while international volume decreased by nearly 5   The combination of macroeconomic volatility  weaker brand recognition overseas and currency headwinds play a considerable role in lackluster overseas sales  As for Sam s Club  Walmart s wholesale arm  net sales grew 1 1  to  14 27 billion from  14 08 billion with comp sales up 100 basis points 
Walmart s biggest advantage over Amazon and other online retailer is its expansive grocery and fresh food offerings  Walmart s are often considered one stop shops for families to do their weekly grocery shopping and to pick up anything else they might need  The adoption of these services amongst online retailers have yet to gain traction  Amazon of course opened up its first grocery store in Seattle that will eventually pose a problem for Walmart down the road  In the meantime stores like  Walmart  Target and Costco  NASDAQ COST  hold the upper hand in this segment 
Home Depot  NYSE HD   Home Depot continues to benefit from the persistent housing market recovery along with a greater focus on improving customer experience and expanding its omni channel capabilities  Many of these moves have supported financial performance in the past few years  despite ongoing difficulties in the retail space created by Amazon  Home improvements have remained resilient from Amazon s wrath where clothing or electronics retailers continue to struggle  The biggest concerns moving forward include currency headwinds  soft consumer spending  and the ongoing rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration 
First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   From a financial perspective  First Solar is one of the only solar companies that hasn t consistently posted a loss  Its primary focus has been on large commercial markets where its competitors have been tied to less profitable residential and small commercial markets  In the previous earnings call the company lowered its revenue guidance for 2016 to  2 8   2 9 billion from earlier projections reaching as high as  4 billion  Some of this should be offset by the sale of large scale utility projects such as the one signed with MCE last quarter   First Solar robust pipeline and unique technology gives them the upperhand against its peers but an industry wide pullback doesn t mean it won t suffer  Meanwhile  Trump s appointment of Scott Pruitt to the EPA sets the stage for a rollback in renewable energy policies that supported financial performance 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  NASDAQ CBRL   The restaurant continues to outperform the broader restaurant industry owing to a differentiated brand experience  strong marketing efforts and sound operations execution  In each quarter of the past 2 years Cracker Barrel posted positive comparisons on both the top and bottom line  Its most recent report recorded a 1 3  increase in comparable store sales  marking a 10th consecutive quarter of positive growth for this metric  Retail sales  on the other hand  remain a point of concern after comp sales decreased 4 0  from a year earlier  Meanwhile traffic continues to decline across both restaurant and retail stores likely from a 2 2  increase in average menu prices ",2017-02-21,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-that-report-earnings-tomorrow-200176318,200176318
9106,230621,CBRL,Fundamentals Show Why Cracker Barrel Is Heavily Shorted,opinion,"Short sellers are keeping an eye on   NASDAQ CBRL  as the company is expected to announce earnings Wednesday  September 14th before the market opens  The stock s current short interest as a percentage of the float is extremely high standing at over 20  
Historical Performance
Over the last five years  Cracker Barrel s shares have outperformed comparable companies    NASDAQ BOBE     NYSE EAT     NASDAQ CAKE     NYSE DRI  and   NASDAQ TXRH  
This can generally be attributed to Cracker Barrel s superior financial performance as shown in the historical five year compounded annual growth rates  CAGRs  below 
Projected Performance
Although Cracker Barrel has outperformed over the last five years  investors care more about how the company is expected to perform over the next five years  Outside of Brinker International  Cracker Barrel s revenue  EBITDA and net income is expected to grow at a lower rate than its peers 

When a company is projected to grow at a lower rate relative to its peers  its stock typically trades at a lower multiple  However  notice Cracker Barrel s EBITDA multiples trade at a premium to every comparable company  except for Texas Roadhouse  

The group s EBITDA multiples have typically traded within a tight range over the previous five years  However  Cracker Barrel and Texas Roadhouse appear to have gone rogue since the beginning of the calendar year 

Cracker Barrel is currently trading at 10 5x EBITDA which is above almost every comparable company as well as its own 5 year average of 9 5x 
The company certainly looks to be trading off its intrinsic value on a relative basis  Cracker Barrel also looks overvalued on a discounted cash flow  DCF  basis as shown in finbox io s fair value estimate 
While CBRL shares have traded lower over the last three months  the stock still looks fundamentally overvalued  With a high short ratio  value investors may want to stay on the sidelines with earnings expected Wednesday morning ",2016-09-13,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fundamentals-show-why-cracker-barrel-is-heavily-shorted-200153189,200153189
9108,230623,CBRL,Learning From Buffett As Markets Drift Higher,opinion,"All intelligent investing is value investing   acquiring more than that you are paying for  You must value the business in order to value the stock   Charlie Munger

Each year during the last week of February  Warren Buffet releases the annual report and shareholder letter of his controlled company  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   For many owners of Berkshire s stock  it is a chance to marvel at the wisdom of the legendary investor and laugh at his unique way of imparting cherished knowledge  Starting from a whopping number of 7 attendees when he first began holding his annual meeting  this year s rendezvous will draw close to 40 thousand 
The biggest reason for such a dramatic increase is the incredible wealth Mr  Buffett has created for it s owners  Just as important are his writings and unique way of imparting his business experiences in an easy to understand and memorable way  Consequently  the annual letter to shareholders is literally required reading for participants in the investment industry  As such  let me share some observations after digesting this year s version 
The first area I found interesting was where the bulk of Berkshire s investment gains in current holdings come from  The answer  in terms of absolute performance and market value  is primarily in three holdings  Coke  NYSE KO   American Express  NYSE AXP   and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC   The first two have market appreciation close to 10 billion dollars on investment of around one billion  The latter also has a gain of fifteen big ones  but the capital used is much higher  nearly  13 billion 
Next  Mr  Buffett remarked on his experiences with acquisitions and how he made mistakes by using stock in acquiring a few companies which subsequently performed poorly  Cash is now probably the preferred currency in ongoing purchases of additional companies  As an individual investor  it is a reminder to pay close attention to the deal structure of companies you own when they make acquisitions 
Cash is the most conservative approach  but probably not the most tax efficient  Third  when you look at the operating earnings of the non insurance and utility businesses that Berkshire owns  the clear emphasis is business quality  The investment holdings Coke and American Express are prime examples of high quality businesses which were purchased and produced massive gains because of later growth 
The common characteristic is for the company to take operating profits and reinvest that capital back in the business at high rates of return  fueling profit expansion in future years  Fourth  Mr  Buffett makes positive remarks about companies buying back their own stock  which is contrary to what some investment analysts believe  Probably the biggest takeaway there is paying attention to the leading quote from Mr  Munger  Buffett also gave his opinion about why passive investing  through indexes  is probably the best way to invest for most people 
Essentially  professional investors  mainly hedge funds  cannot beat indexes because of the high fees they charge  I would note Buffett has changed his tune over the years on this subject  As he was growing his business empire  Buffett routinely made the observation on how beating the S P 500 by small or large amounts over a long period of time could make a dramatic difference in how much wealth is accumulated  I guess it is a case of do as I say  not as I do  which is understandable  Buffett s position has changed a great deal so it is probably better for him to be more conservative in how he advises the general public  The great thing about investing is you can choose whatever approach which bests suits you  either  both  or neither 
Additionally  let me offer this copy of a funny story  which  in full disclosure  comes straight from the annual report this year  Pg 25  2016 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report  

Long ago  a brother in law of mine  Homer Rogers  was a commission agent working in the Omaha stockyards  I asked him how he induced a farmer or rancher to hire him to handle the sale of their hogs or cattle to the buyers from the big four packers  Swift  Cudahy  Wilson and Armour   After all  hogs were hogs and the buyers were experts who knew to the penny how much any animal was worth  How then  I asked Homer  could any sales agent get a better result than any other  Homer gave me a pitying look and said   Warren  it s not how you sell  em  it s how you tell  em   What worked in the stockyards continues to work in Wall Street 

If you want to read the letter  click  
In the financial markets  the week was full of earnings reports  including from heavyweights in the retail sector like Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Macy s  NYSE M   Kohl s  NYSE KSS   JC Penney  NYSE JCP   and L Brands  NYSE LB   Expectations remain very low about this group because of the competitive dynamic regarding the big A  In case you don t quite get it  see the prior comment about reinvesting capital  Another area where quite a few companies reported was in quick service dining  Jack In The Box  NASDAQ JACK   Cracker Barrel  NASDAQ CBRL   and Red Robin Gourmet  NASDAQ RRGB  announced results which were varied but pretty much as expected  December proved a difficult month for the industry because of tough weather 
Finally  beware of companies  coaches  and politicians heralding their previous victories  People care about current and future results and not about a prior battle  Our current President continues to relive the election results in November  Advisors to Mr  Trump should politely explain there are all kinds of substantive matters which the country needs to address  with his leadership  Maybe the State of the Union will be the place to start detailing those plans  On the Democratic side  today is the election of the DNC Chair with the choice between ultra liberal and ultra ultra liberal  Hard to see how either person can help the party begin to address the lack of a coherent plan regarding growing the economy  Maybe they can get some guidance from Mr  Buffett  a long time Dem

9127,230642,CBRL,3 Top Ranked Stocks For Women s Day,opinion,"A  conducted by Mintigo proves that women are now indeed on par with men  The study claims that companies with female CEOs yield better results than those run by their male counterparts 
Further  according to the latest available data  Fortune 1000 companies with women CEOs have returned 103 4  on average under their tenure  compared with an average return of 69 5  for the S P 500 index over the same period 
Relegated for a very long time as the second sex  not given property rights  the right to vote  earn a decent living or have access to proper education and basic health care  haven t women successfully beaten down the doors  It is to those gritty women  over the ages  that International Women s Day   IWD   is dedicated 
HERstory
A flash back to the turn of the 20th century and we find IWD has had its origins in the socialist movements of North America and Europe  In the U S   the first National Woman s Day was celebrated on February 28  1909 in remembrance of the 1908 garment workers  strike in New York 
Women workers had taken to the street protesting against dismal working conditions and poor pay  not far from the financial nerve center today  where the Wall Street Bull is   When the bell rings and the markets open  you can measure the progress that has been made by the women s movement  from then and now 
Women in Today s Corporate World
Women have  a century later  broken into the male bastions of business and politics  the armed forces and the hallowed corridors of learning 
Corporate America hangs on every word the Fed Chair Janet Yellen utters  Ranked  6 on Forbes  The World s Most Powerful People  just after the German chancellor  and another woman of substance  Angela Merkel  Yellen has a mission of repairing the American dream of equal opportunities for all 
And if you see the list of S P 500 companies  women currently hold 23 CEO positions  According to a Business Insider article published last month  the stocks of these 23 women led companies have surpassed the Dow  the NYSE  and the S P 500 over the last 12 months 
Women lead some of the most powerful companies in the U S  today  The shift has been from traditionally perceived  women s spheres  like advertising and media  where the emphasis is on creativity  to minding tough jobs like heading the world s top defense company Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   or being at the helm of one of the biggest car makers  General Motors  NYSE GM  
The male domains of defense  health care and technology are now taken over by some very smart  qualified and extremely poised women  Leading generic and specialty drug maker Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  has a woman CEO and so is the top brass of the tech companies Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO  and IBM  NYSE IBM   Xerox  NYSE XRX  is led by Ursula M  Burns   the first African American to rise to the top of a Fortune 500 company 
3 Top Ranked Stocks that Bet on Women
Below  we take a quick look at three stocks that are topped by women and have massive upside potential 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc   NASDAQ CBRL 
Headed by Sandra B  Cochran  this restaurant operator has seen its shares rise over 50  in the past year  The company has surpassed earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 8 5   Also  the company s latest activities have won analysts  confidence  as reflected by the 7 2  upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal over the last 30 days  Consequently  the stock achieved a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicating further potential for price gain 
Gannett Co  Inc   NYSE GCI 
Led by the veteran Gracia Martore  Gannett is a media and marketing solutions company with a return of about 20  in the past year  Gannett s earnings surprise history is also unblemished over the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 4 2   Analysts have also been positive on this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 climbing 1 2  in the last 30 days 
Ross Stores Inc   NASDAQ ROST 
At the helm of off price retailer Ross Stores is Barbara Rentler  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company has seen its shares rise above 45  in the past year  The company has also beaten earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters  with a positive surprise of 4 7   The Dress for Less retailer has also elicited bullish estimate revisions with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal moving up about 1  in the last 30 days 
Secrets Behind Their Incredible Success
Of course  the toil has been hard but the  will to lead  stronger  It is also believed that the turn from an industrial to a post industrial economy  where the emphasis shifted from the application of brute force to the intellect  from brawn to brain  has helped women to come up  Hence we see so many women in the tech space climbing the very male dominated corporate ladder   their degrees in STEM  Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics  have made it possible 
Add to this a sea change in the mindset where marriages are based on a 50 50 partnership  household chores and child raising are shared by both partners  and the support pitched in by the extended family  have helped women to not only stay in the work force but also to work their way up 
Women have made quite a few cracks in the glass ceiling  And some even claim there isn t a glass ceiling any more  but a sunroof 
The Other Side of the Story
But this is only one half of the story  To admit an uncomfortable fact  the large majority of these  ceiling crashers  come from a privileged section of the society and are mostly white women  There is less and less representation of women of color in the higher echelons   admittedly there is the pop star CEO of PepsiCo Inc   NYSE PEP  Indra K  Nooyi and Ursula Burns at Xerox  but they re more of an exception than a rule 
The idea of  leaning in  ignores the realities of women of color  of poor immigrants  of women on the margins  It is here the story of corporate feminism falls into crevices and miserably fails to retrieve the battle for those women who re not in a position to lean in  to do the motivational work that is required of them to succeed in life and find a place in corporate America 
Not taking anything away from the achievers   yes  the progress has been astounding   but we still have some way to go ",2015-03-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-top-ranked-stocks-for-women's-day-244198,244198

9129,230644,CBRL,Does Technical Analysis Still Work ,opinion,"On Friday morning  a trading friend of mine wrote me and asked me if I thought technical analysis worked anymore  His point and it s one I ve considered many times is  in this central banker planned world in which we now all live  do charts have predictive value anymore  I mean  let s face it  technical analysis had its own shaky reputation to begin with  In this modern age  with Yellen at the helm  are charts just a waste of time 
I suppose it comes as no great surprise that my answer was  no  they aren t a waste of time   After all  I ve devoted my adult life to this field  and in spite of what could be argued is a fair amount of personal bias  I still deeply feel that the underpinnings of technical analysis are still valid 
I will say  emphatically  that technical analysis is hampered greatly by central bank intervention  and I ve noticed a marked improvement in its efficacy since QE was removed back in October  
With one exception  which I ll point out   these were all short ideas  and in spite of the market being near the highest levels of human history right now  I think you ll agree they did pretty well  I ve circled in red the approximate price level where I suggested the short idea   Here we go

Sonic lasted until it reported earnings March 24th  With a supersonic run higher the few days prior to earnings and in between illiquid options strikes  so no way to protect it  we exited the stock ahead of earnings  Following the report  the stock plummeted and then proceeded to drift lower 

Since mid April though  the stock has been consolidating in a rounded bottoming pattern and against resistance at 31 40  Thursday marked the third touch at resistance and from a higher low  creating an ascending triangle  This is a bullish set up that would target a move to 34 50 on a break higher 
The momentum indicators are supportive of a move higher as well  The RSI is rising and about to cross into the bullish zone  while the MACD has crossed up and is rising too  The Bollinger Bands  are also hinting a shift to the upside 
When examining the options table  there is very large open interest for next week at the 35 Call Strike  another possible catalyst for a move  Burgers in general have come back in favor  and Sonic reports again on June 22nd after the market close  Keep an eye on this one for a break out higher and another supersonic run

9131,230646,CBRL,Lower For Longer Lives As The Fed Blinks,opinion,"The commander must decide how he will fight the battle before it begins  He must then decide who he will use the military effort at his disposal to force the battle to swing the way he wishes it to go  he must make the enemy dance to his tune from the beginning and not vice versa   Viscount Montgomery of Alamein

On Thursday at 11 am  all eyes were glued on the Federal Reserve to see if they would  after nearly six years at rock bottom  finally raise interest rates  We are not talking about a huge jump either  a pin prick of a raise  25 basis points  Won t hurt one bit  It will be fine  Could they pull the trigger  And that would be a great big  giant  no  no  no  no  no  NO     Naturally  market participants decided to view this in a negative light  wondering whether global growth is not just slowing down  but maybe dramatically so  The growth question has to be asked  because  if economic activity is increasing and inflation is indeed picking up  the textbook policy play is to raise interest rates  As such  our markets sold off some on Friday because the Fed could not do the deed 
In examining the decision by Mrs  Yellen and the rest of her highly regarded and well educated colleagues at the Fed  it is apparent there are a few main issues  Inflation is not where it needs to be  there is still too much  slack   in the job market  and adding a third leg to the stool  global growth is precariously thin  Weakness in emerging market currencies and market volatility in China also helped contributed to the deferment  If you add in the pressure on commodity prices and it s effect on big producers like Brazil  and Canada  among others  it becomes clear the urge to surge went bye bye as soon as China s markets went kaplooey  Throw in the continuing effort by the ECB to bolster European economies through their version of quantitative easing  and you have to think the Fed was also very aware of how different directions in interest rate policy might make markets even more skittish  The bottom line for investors is we are currently in an environment where the glass is clearly viewed as half empty  If interest rates are believed headed higher  markets sell off  When interest rates stay the same  markets sell off  Not good if you are long  Of course  if you are a buyer  lower prices are always sweet  Hmmm  which way are you going  Never mind  I know  you keep the good ideas for yourself 
Anyway  the rest of the news in financial markets was relatively sparse  The biggest event came when Altice NV  AMS ATCA  announced it would buy Cablevision  NYSE CVC  for nearly 18 billion bucks  Mr  Drahi s move this week was preceded earlier in the year with the acquisition of Suddenlink for  9 billion  Clearly  Mr  Malone s younger competitor knows how to take advantage of an attractive borrowing environment  Smart move  Still  the logistical implications of combining Cablevision with Suddenlink are going to prove challenging  Of course  you know I am biased  Why might that be  Long time readers know the answer  so maybe take a tour through the archives 
Cracker Barrel  NASDAQ CBRL  reported earnings which came in on target but guidance and revenues were a bit light  Still  it seems driving long distances through the Midwest and South makes people a little hungry  Imagine that  The next few weeks will probably be somewhat similar to this week  with few earnings announcements as the quarter finishes up  Friday was options expiration so that may have contributed to the volatility a little as well ",2015-09-20,Yale Bock,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/lower-for-longer-lives-as-the-fed-blinks,-and-the-2nd-debate-265602",265602
9132,230647,CBRL,Retail Earnings  Consumer Confidence Doesn t Equal Sales Growth,opinion,"Home Depot  NYSE HD  reported earlier Tuesday  with EPS for Q4 coming in at  1 00  topping both the Estimize and Wall Street consensus by a large margin and growing 37  over Q4 2013  In fact  the  0 11 beat against the Street was the largest beat by the home improvement retailer in over 15 years  Revenues were equally as impressive at  19 16B vs  the Estimize consensus of  18 73B  increasing 8  YoY  This bodes well for Lowe s  NYSE LOW  s which will report Wednesday 

Also Tuesday morning  we continued to see disparities in the restaurant industry  with Domino s  NYSE DPZ  releasing disappointing bottom line results and Cracker Barrel  NASDAQ CBRL  putting up extremely impressive numbers  Domino s EPS for Q4 settled at  0 91  three pennies shy of the Estimize consensus  Despite the profit miss  the company was able to post revenue of  643M   25M ahead of the Estimize prediction  Top line results were driven by stronger sales at home and a push to expand overseas  while margins suffered as the company struggled to expand domestically due to stiff competition in the pizza delivery space 

Cracker Barrel on the other hand posted EPS of  1 93  well ahead of the Estimize consensus of  1 61 and the Wall Street consensus of  1 60  growing 24  YoY  Revenues also came in better than expected at  756 vs   732M from Estimize  The company saw increased traffic in the fourth quarter due to mild weather and low gasoline prices  which encouraged consumer spending  As a result  the casual dining company now expects fiscal 2015 EPS in the range of  6 40    6 50 in comparison to the previous forecast of  5 95    6 10 

Lastly  Macy s  NYSE M   the second largest multi line retailer in the S P 500  posted weaker than expected results for the most recent quarter  Earnings per share of  2 44 missed the Estimize consensus by a penny  but managed to narrowly beat the Street s expectation by the same amount  Revenues of  9 36B fell short of both estimates  Despite a more confident U S  consumer that has more discretionary income to allocate  Macy s suffered from sluggish holiday sales as more people choose to spend on electronics  autos and healthcare  As a result  the retailer s 2015 outlook is for EPS in the range of  4 70    4 80  the top end of which misses analysts  predictions by about  0 05

Thursday  June 2


Michael Kors  NYSE KORS 
Consumer Discretionary   Textiles  Apparel   Luxury Goods   Reports June 1  before the open 
The Estimize consensus on  is calling for earnings of 98 cents per share on  1 153 billion in revenue  2 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on the top  Since the holiday season earnings estimates have fallen 3  while revenue has dropped only 1   Year over year comparisons are now projecting a 9  increase in profitability with sales anticipated to grow 11   KORS has a history of beating the consensus  surpassing bottom line expectations 81  of the time and revenues 88  of the time

What to watch  This year  many upscale apparel and accessories brands have been worse off as consumers opt for discounted goods and services  This season we have already seen losses from luxury retailers including Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  and Tiffany s  NYSE TIF   setting the stage for weakness from Michael Kors  Vera Bradley  NASDAQ VRA   and lululemon  NASDAQ LULU  over the next week 
In an effort to drive top line growth  Michael Kors has focused on opening new stores  Last quarter the company opened 34 new stores  15 in the United States and the rest in international markets  While the new stores will increase operating costs and contract margins  they should help generate higher revenue in the near term  Global stores should continue to see adverse impacts from weak currency conditions 
Regardless  Michael Kors continues to deliver positive growth in key financial metrics including revenue  net sales  profits and net income  Unfortunately  another setback will be the fact that Nordstrom has decided to no longer carry Michael Kors handbags  Nordstrom has been feeling squeezed by Macy s  NYSE M  and other mid priced department stores to price match and discount similar Kors bags  The ongoing promotions Macy s had been running was a major determinant for Nordstrom to stop carrying the bags  This clearly isn t a good thing for Michael Kors  which should expect to feel the aftermath for the remainder of the year 
Cracker Barrel  NASDAQ CBRL 
Consumer Discretionary   Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure   Reports June 1  before the open 
The Estimize consensus on  is calling for earnings per share of  1 81  one cent higher than Wall Street  Revenue expectations of  705 1 million are just slightly ahead of the sell side s  703 95 million  Estimates on both the top and bottom line have stayed flat since the Q4 2015 report  with EPS now expected to grow 22  YoY and revenues by 3   expectations increased 92  and revenues 8  

What to Watch  Despite a lackluster FQ2  Cracker Barrel has benefited from the resurgence in the casual dining space  The stock is up nearly 19  in the past 6 months and is poised to jump following its report 
Cracker Barrel has seen increasing interest in its brand despite not having made any major changes  The company continues to deliver positive comparable store sales on core values and offerings of the past 50 years  Recent results have also continued to outperform peers in the casual dining industry and even its own expectations 
In its Q2 analyst call  the company raised its fiscal year earnings for the second half of 2016 to reflect moderation in commodity prices and the opening of 5 to 6 new stores  Cracker Barrel also recently announced it will transition to cage free eggs in its commitment to provide high quality products  The company plans to source 100  of its eggs from cage free hens by 2026  The shift also feeds changing consumer preferences for healthy and organic ingredients 
Ambarella  NASDAQ AMBA 
Information Technology   Semiconductors   Reports June 2  after the close 
The Estimize community consensus on  calls for EPS of  0 33  6 cents above Wall Street  Revenue expectations from Estimize are also higher at  57 11 million as compared to the Street s  55 94 million  Estimates have come down over the last 3 months  with EPS expected to decrease 54   and sales down 19  YoY 

What to Watch  The GoPro  NASDAQ GPRO  chipmaker has had a great run since IPOing in 2014  beating the Estimize EPS consensus in all 7 quarters despite the struggles of its biggest client  However  those results started to crack last quarter  with the expectation that negative earnings growth will continue in FQ1 2017 
GoPro reported earlier in the season and severely missed on the bottom line  reporting a loss per share of   0 63  a YoY decline in profits of 363   with revenues declining 49   Shares of AMBA have been in a downward spiral as well  After reaching highs of  126 70 in June 2015  shares of Ambarella have plummeted 68  in the past 12 months  Fortunately  the semiconductor manufacturer is attempting to diversify its top line away from action cameras and drones and into less volatile products ",2016-06-01,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-5-31---wday,-asna,-kors,-cbrl,-amba-200133202",200133202
9151,230666,CBRL,One Sector Every Portfolio Should Have,opinion,"Every stock market portfolio should consider restaurant stocks if the risk tolerance allows for it 
This industry sector has a long track record of delivering good capital gains to investors  recognizing  of course  that all restaurant chains experience periods of turmoil and changes among consumer preferences 
Fierce And Slim
In the restaurant business  competition is fierce and because there are so many options  margins are slim 
Sonic Corp  NASDAQ SONC  just reported its financial results for its third fiscal quarter  ended May 31  2014  
The company s system wide store sales grew 5 3   with total revenues  including both company owned drive ins as well as franchises  growing to  152 million  compared to  147 million in the same quarter last year 
Sonic s two year stock chart is featured below 

Chart courtesy of 
The company expects earnings per share growth of between 14  and 15  in fiscal 2014  and the position is fully priced on the stock market 
Operationally  Sonic is experiencing renewed momentum in its business  with most new store openings being new franchises 
The stock did incredibly well from the late 1990s to the end of 2007  until the company s growth picture turned  It wasn t until the beginning of 2013  like so many other stocks  that the company was able to reenergize operations  The stock has doubled over the last 18 months 
Cyclical
All restaurant chains experience periods when they just can t produce the same growth as they used to  Combined with changes in consumer preferences  general economic conditions and the wholesale cost of food  these stocks are cyclical 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  NASDAQ CBRL  hit  118 00 on the stock market late last year but has since retrenched to the  100 00 per share level as the company s system wide sales slowed 
This well known chain has really done well over the last two years   See  4  and Rising  This Company Consistently Growing Investors  Income    From 1998 to 2008  the position did nothing on the stock market 
Timing Is Crucial
So the sector is very much about getting the cycle right  As the saying goes   timing is everything  
Cracker Barrel is an income producing stock  and with a current dividend yield of four percent and a forward price to earnings ratio of approximately 16  the position is attractive 
Earnings should grow about 12  this fiscal year and about 11  in fiscal 2015  according to current estimates 
What I like about Cracker Barrel  not to the exclusion of other operators  is that all of its stores are company owned  Franchising is great and it has proven to work many times in the past  but corporate ownership allows for strong control over system wide operations and typically  each location is more profitable 
Risk
Restaurant stocks are higher risk and they aren t blue chip  Today   fast casual  is the new buzzword for highly successful operations like Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  
For those with less tolerance for risk  a company like Cracker Barrel would fit the bill with its reasonable valuation  solid operations  and higher dividend yield 
The company opened 10 new drive ins during its fiscal third quarter and earnings grew to  16 8 million  or  0 30 per diluted share  from  14 8 million  or  0 26 per diluted share  for an earnings per share gain of 15  ",2014-06-30,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/one-sector-every-portfolio-should-have-217893,217893
9152,230667,CBRL,Thursday s Value Stocks At A Glance,opinion,"As incredible as it may be  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  NYSE CMG  recently spiked above  600 00 a share and is now closing in on  700 00  This position could no doubt benefit from a share split 
The stock is trading with a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of approximately 40  and the company s earnings estimates for this fiscal year and next continue to tick higher 
A more aggressive portfolio of stocks is typically well served by exposure to the restaurant sector  Many chains are consistently good earners  but you can t get too attached to any positions  consumer tastes change and competition is fierce 
Restaurant stocks also experience waves of enthusiasm on the part of investors and because of this  you can actually find value among established brands 
Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI  is the owner of the  Olive Garden  and  LongHorn Steakhouse  chains  The company recently sold  Red Lobster  for  2 1 billion in cash  using  1 0 billion to pay down its debt with the rest to be spent on share repurchases 
This stock hasn t done much over the last couple of years due to operational problems  but it now boasts a dividend yield of just less than five percent and is not expensively priced 
Value among restaurant stocks can also be found with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  NASDAQ CBRL  
This position has been flat since February  and its dividend yield has now crept above the four percent level 
The company should soon report its financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2014  In its third fiscal quarter  ended May 2  2014   Cracker Barrel s revenues grew 0 5  over the comparable quarter to  643 million  Earnings grew 17  to  25 7 million  or  1 20 per diluted share  up from  24 6 million  or  1 02 per diluted share  in the comparable quarter   See     
Revenue from the company s store items typically represents about 18  of the total  Cracker Barrel has lots of cash in the bank  and management recently approved a 33  increase to its quarterly dividend 
Restaurant stocks can definitely be volatile as operational problems  changing tastes  food costs  usually the biggest expense   and consumer spending directly affect the bottom line 
But institutional investors consistently bid these stocks when operations turn around  With this potential and a higher than average dividend yield  both Cracker Barrel and Darden Restaurants now seem attractive 
There is a reason why stocks like Chipotle Mexican Grill can be so expensively priced 
The company had an excellent second quarter  producing revenue growth of 29  to  1 05 billion  Earnings grew 26  to  110 3 million  which is very good profitability for a restaurant enterprise with 45 new locations having opened during the quarter 
Restaurant stocks do experience the impact of a herd mentality among investors  and growth stories  like Chipotle Mexican Grill  tend to get way overpriced 
But they often remain that way until there is a dramatic change in operational growth  With increasing traffic and an increasing average check  I wouldn t be surprised at all if this stock sails past  700 00 a share for a new breakout 
With the current wave of enthusiasm passing through these restaurant stocks  investors can find value in this sector

9153,230668,CBRL,Loading Up On Cracker Barrel,opinion,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  NASDAQ CBRL  is about as American a restaurant as you can get  Macaroni and Cheese  Fried Chicken  Meatloaf  Hush Puppies and large portions  Rocking chairs on the porch  I love it  Unfortunately for me my health conscious Pilates instructor wife will never even let me drive in the parking lot  So when the stock sets up for a move higher it is my only chance to get involved in the company  otherwise I have to live vicariously through others  Well it just happens that now is one of those times 

The chart above shows the weekly price action in the stock since September 2012  It had a great run higher until December 2013  Since then it has pulled back and gone through a consolidation  As it is bouncing up against the resistance line at 103 the momentum indicators are supporting more upside and a break higher  How high could it go  One view is that the break would trigger a AB CD pattern  And that pattern would target a move to 174  possibly by the end of next year  Please pass me the green beans

9154,230669,CBRL,Alibaba Is Entertaining   And Profitable For Some,opinion,"As the above quote indicates  remaining cool while the rest of society trembles in trepidation is not only admirable  it has the potential for being lucrative  You saw a real life example of this quote in the investment world at the start of the week  it seemed the overwhelming sentiment was we would be in for a rough time because the universe had to make room for the new star on the block  Alibaba  NYSE BABA   It had its IPO Friday  Others were nervous about what the Federal Reserve Board would do and Janet Yellen would say at her press conference after the announcement  Yellen proved remarkably consistent as the overriding theme still remains employment levels are the far bigger concern  rather than inflation  With no change in language regarding the time frame between finishing quantitative easing and potentially raising interest rates  maintained at considerable  or forever  whichever you find more appropriate   any thought of a non investor friendly Fed should go right out the window for the foreseeable future 
The phew of relief proved noticeable as the market proceeded to have a big day on Thursday  followed by a nice pop at the opening on Friday  Gee  could it have been the circus was in town  Nope  but the show that is Alibaba proved plenty entertaining  and profitable too  You see  the chosen few who received allocations to the IPO were treated to a 38  lift in the shares  They priced at  68 and closed at  93 89  for those of you interested in the specifics  BABA is now worth nearly  250 billion  and is one of the largest companies in the world by market value  earned or not  Interestingly enough  Yahoo ran up some before the IPO  but finished down a buck at the close  Having previously mentioned the Yahoo  s  NASDAQ YHOO   you might find comments regarding its potential strategy  shall we say  familiar 
Across the pond  the Scots decided they liked their fellow Brits after all and to not leave the United Kingdom  at least for now  Apparently  all across Europe the mood to divorce your parents is catching on  Catalonia wants to have a vote on detaching from Spain  There are also noticeable rumblings that Flanders may be intent on separating from the Netherlands as well  It seems the nanny state is not working so nicely  or not nicely enough  depending on your perspective 
In specific company news  Adobe Systems Incorporated  NASDAQ ADBE  and Oracle Corporation  NYSE ORCL  reported results which were below expectations  Larry Ellison decided he needed a break  so he stepped down as CEO  although he will continue as head dictator in the universe  In all seriousness  Mr  Ellison has built a powerful company and made plenty of shareholders very happy for a number of decades  let alone years  Cracker Barrel  NASDAQ CBRL  posted a surprising number but guided soft for the rest of the year  The blow up of the week was Rite Aid s  NYSE RAD  major miss  which also predicted substandard results for a while  Retail remains a very volatile area in any number of ways  which is also why there is opportunity  Good luck on that one 
Elsewhere in the business world  the NFL remains in the headlines with the repeated character issues of its players  if that is what you want to call them  other words might be more applicable   Certainly helping to cause this situation are the massive contracts the NFL has across the media spectrum  In sum  the league splits nearly  7 billion a year amongst them various teams  over  200 million per team each year  As an observer  do you really think owners care about the price of hot dogs for fans  Really  I don t think so either 
The issue is part of a problem which exists in almost every part of society  and that is compensating groups in amounts which are inconsistent with incentives  or well in excess of their production  In the corporate world  the typically management team is paid salaries  bonuses  stock options  and restricted stock units  Often times  the potential total compensation sums are staggering to the average working person  Much of it is based on operational performance of the business  and then  to a lesser extent  on how the stock fares  In the best managed companies  operations based pay takes the greatest percentage of the total amount awarded  There are a variety of metrics which are used to analyze operations  and a broad criteria is usually best  One such standard is Earnings Per Share  EPS   and it is used frequently in the investment world to help determine price to earnings ratios  EPS can be manipulated by creative management teams using a variety of accounting techniques which are considered  at best  low quality  At worst  they are illegal  These are typically related to some kind of compensation award  which again goes back to incentives  Charlie Munger has long spoken about the importance of incentives and now you know one reason why 
Next week  we are back at it and I suspect you will see some window dressing as those that have won during the quarter get bid up  Those which have not  which are typically the majority  remain unloved or disposed of  One way or another  I am sure you will be paying attention and you know I will  Thank you for reading the blog this week

The Q1 earnings season is now effectively behind us  though we are still waiting for reports from 11 S P 500 companies  We will see results this holiday shortened week from 71 companies in total  including 5 S P 500 members  The notable companies reporting results this week include Michael Kors  NYSE KORS   AutoZone  NYSE AZO   Costco  NASDAQ COST   Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL  and others  Most of the remaining Q1 earnings reports are from the consumer centric sectors  primarily the Retail sector  The coming reports are unlikely to change the picture that has emerged from the reports thus far  Strong results from a couple of retailers notwithstanding  it has been a tough environment for the sector  The sector s weak stock price performance year to date  the weakest among the 16 Zacks sectors  reflects this reality  Retail sector stocks in the S P 500 are down  5 3  year to date  which compares to positive  3 2  gain for the S P 500 index as a whole in that same time period  Total earnings for the 41 retailers in the S P 500 that have reported results already  out of a total of 43  are flat  0 0  on  3 3  higher revenues  with a low 43 9  of them beating earnings estimates and an even lower 39 0  coming ahead of top line expectations   Combining the Retail sector earnings for the 41 companies that have come out with the 2 still to come  the sector s total earnings in Q1 should be up 0 4  on  3 7  higher revenues and lower margins  Same store sales improved markedly in April  with pent up demand following Q1 s harsh weather and the Easter shift benefiting the numbers  The broad trends about the Q1 earnings are fairly well established by now and the coming reports are unlikely to change them in any material way  These trends pertain to anemic growth  fewer top line surprises and continued negative guidance that is prompting estimates for the current period to come down 
Scorecard for 2014 Q1  as of Friday  May 23rd 
Total earnings for the 489 S P 500 members that have reported results are up 1 2  from the same period last year  with a  beat ratio  of 67 7  and a median surprise of  3 96   Total revenues are up  2 6   with a revenue  beat ratio  of 51 3  and the median company beating top line expectations by 0 13   The table below shows the current scorecard for all 16 Zacks sectors  As you can see  the earnings season has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with results from just 1 8  of the index s total market capitalization still awaited 
 
The chart below shows how the earnings and revenue growth rates for Q1 thus far compare to what these same companies reported in 2013 Q4 and the 4 quarter average    The Q1 earnings growth picture is no doubt weak  But we should keep two things in mind while evaluating this growth picture  Firstly  it wasn t news to the market  as expectations had fallen sharply ahead of the start of the reporting season  As such  as shocking as the above picture seems to be  nobody was exactly shocked at seeing them  Secondly  the growth picture actually isn t as bad as the above picture is making it out to be once the drag from the Finance sector  which itself is a function of weak results at Bank of America  is excluded from the aggregate results  The comparison chart below of ex Finance results clearly shows this 

This chart of ex Finance growth is showing that the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q1 are roughly comparable to historical averages  Nothing exciting about that finding  but it is actually an improvement over what was expected just a couple of weeks back  Looking at the composite Q1 picture  meaning combining the actual results from the 489 companies that have reported with estimates for the 11 still to come reports  total earnings are expected to be up 1 3  on  2 7  higher revenues  The table below presents the  composite  summary picture for Q1  showing the year over year change in total earnings  revenues and margins for all 16 Zacks sectors 
  As we saw in the Q1 results  the low expectations made it easy for companies to come out ahead of them  Roughly two thirds of the S P 500 members beat earnings expectations every quarter any way and we are right around that level in Q1 as well  What we haven t seen for a while is positive guidance and favorable comments from management teams about business outlook  And Q1 is largely along those same lines  causing estimates for the current period to come down  as the chart below of evolving Q2 estimates shows 

The downtrend in Q2 estimates is consistent with the trend that has been in place for almost two years now  Stocks made impressive gains over the last two years even though estimates were coming down during that time period  with the Fed QE keeping alive hopes of an eventual growth recovery  It will be interesting to see if investors will respond any differently to the coming period of negative revisions   Monday 5 26

9171,230686,CBRL,4  And Rising  Cracker Barrel Consistently Growing Investors  Income,opinion,"When you walk into a Cracker Barrel restaurant  you pretty much know what you re going to get   And you know what kind of candy will tempt you on the way out   And when it comes to its action in the investing world  the situation isn t all that different 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  Inc   NASDAQ CBRL  is a successful restaurant chain that s had a very good run operationally and on the stock market  The position s come back from its all time record high quite significantly  and with a forward price to earnings ratio of around 15 and a 4 2  dividend yield  this company may be coming back into the  buy  zone 
Cracker Barrel s business is directly related to economic activity and travel spending  given the company s large number of locations on interstate highways 
Uncharacteristically  the company s most recent quarter produced a slight comparative reduction in total revenues  For the quarter ending January 31  2014  Cracker Barrel s sales were  698 5 million  compared to  702 7 million in the same quarter of the previous year 
But earnings held up  growing to  37 0 million from  35 0 million  comparatively  Management recently increased its dividend substantially  The company s stock chart is featured below 

Cracker Barrel reports its updated quarter results next week  Currently  the company is operating 625 stores in 42 states 
Management recently initiated a cost reduction program  looking for  50 0 million in annual savings by fiscal 2017 
The company s average check has been experiencing solid growth in recent months  but comparable restaurant traffic has been down  Citing bad weather  strong competition  and an overall reduction in vehicle traffic  weather related and shorter vacations   the company had to lower its fiscal third quarter earnings guidance to between  1 18 and  1 23 a share  down from the previous range of  1 20 to  1 30 
Naturally  like so many other corporations  when things get tight  management looks for ways to keep shareholders happy  The company just announced another dividend increase  This time  it was a 33  improvement in the quarterly dividend to  1 00 a share  payable on August 5 to shareholders of record on July 18 
One activist investor is advocating for a large special dividend to be paid to shareholders and or the outright sale of the company  But shareholders consistently vote against this strategy 
In any case  in order for Cracker Barrel to get its share price moving again  it s going to have to turn comparable restaurant and store sales around and that s no easy task 
From the investor s perspective  rising dividends are helpful and Cracker Barrel has done so for its fifth consecutive year  
Top line growth for this company is slow  But over the last several years  earnings have been a standout and growth should get back on track going into the next calendar year 
Below  90 00 a share  this position would become a decent value and an attractive investment to income seeking investors 
Restaurant stocks can really pay when traffic numbers improve  Cracker Barrel has proven it can increase its average check  now all the company needs to do is get more boots into its stores  so more advertising and promotions are likely

principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When

9424,230939,CBRL,Consumer Cracks Emerge as Banks Say Everything Looks Fine,news," Bloomberg     Jamie Dimon has been quick to trumpet the strength of U S  consumers  Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell calls them a bright spot that is countering weakness in the manufacturing sector 
But there are signs that U S  households are starting to feel stretched  possibly making it harder for them to continue propping up the economy 
The evidence is showing up on the debt side  Serious delinquencies on credit cards and auto debt have been creeping up in recent quarters  That s pushed some banks to set aside more money to cover bad loans and tighten lending standards for credit cards and other consumer loans 
Adding to the concerns was an unexpected drop in retail sales in September  the first decline in seven months  While economists don t see any serious problems yet  the numbers showed that consumers  who power some 70  of the U S  economy  may be on shakier footing  That s a potentially worrisome sign when the manufacturing sector slipped into a recession in the first half of the year and businesses broadly are cutting back on investments 
 We re in a more fragile situation where consumers are more skittish   said Diane Swonk  chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago   They re more susceptible to negative news shocks even though we ve got what should be these great underlying fundamentals  
 Late Cycle 
Many banks are already reacting  Even as JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM  Chief Executive Officer Dimon was calling the consumer  quite strong  earlier this month  his bank increased the money it was setting aside for loan losses in its consumer and community banking division to  1 3 billion  from  980 million a year earlier  It did so even as the amount of loans in that unit s books fell 
Discover Financial Services  NYSE DFS  lifted loan loss provisions by 8   saying consumers were  holding up well  but the company was being  disciplined and conservative and credit because it feels late cycle  
  American Express   Co   NYSE AXP  also increased the amount it set aside for loan losses by 8  for the three months ended in September  because it had to write off slightly more bad loans  and more borrowers are falling behind on their obligations 
Across the U S  in the three months that ended in June  auto loans that were 90 or more days late made up 4 6  of total balances  near the highest level since 2011  In credit card lending  5 17  of loans turned seriously delinquent in that period  the fastest rate since 2012  according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data 
Those rates remain well below levels seen during the financial crisis  but represent an uptick from earlier years in the recovery when banks were reluctant to lend to all but the most creditworthy borrowers 
 Why would firms go out there and take a big swing on risk   said Brett Ryan  a senior U S  economist for  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  
Smaller banks have been competing aggressively for new card customers  helping delinquencies on those loans spike to 6 3   compared with 2 4  for accounts tied to the 100 largest lenders  according to Fed data 
Some bank research analysts are now raising more questions about how any weakness among consumers will affect finance companies  JPMorgan equity analysts said they were turning more conservative on firms including Ally Financial Inc  and Santander  MC SAN  Consumer USA Holdings Inc   citing a potential economic slowdown and signs of weaker labor markets 
Wage growth has been strong for much of the last year  but it s since slowed to its lowest level in more than a year  to about 2 9  
 More Cautious 
Some corporate executives are also growing more wary  Gene Lee  chief executive officer of Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc  NYSE DRI    said in a conference call last month that  there s some uncertainty entering into the consumer  despite strong wage growth and employment 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc  s  NASDAQ CBRL  CEO Sandra Cochran said last month that the company had turned  more cautious  on consumer demand as they begin to feel the effects of tariffs and higher gas prices 
UBS Group AG  NYSE UBS  analysts said they re growing worried about lower income consumers who are showing signs of weakness in an otherwise strong market  A survey conducted by the bank found that debt burdens for many of those households have grown  and more are reporting credit problems like loan application rejections 
Of the people surveyed  21  said their mortgage loan applications aren t completely accurate  up 2 percentage points from a year ago  That s a sign that banks  credit tightening is  substantial enough to require some consumers to falsify part of their loan application   the analysts wrote  And fewer households reported that their financial condition had improved in recent months 
About 44  of consumers are not meeting their expenses  the UBS report showed  That s just a tick above the level a year ago but still the highest in five years 
 This is a two tier economy   said Matthew Mish  a credit strategist at UBS ",2019-10-28,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/consumer-cracks-emerge-as-banks-say-everything-looks-fine-2005654,2005654

9443,230958,CBRL,Wall Street Week Ahead  Restaurants  uptick offers hope for consumer discretionaries,news,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK  Reuters    An improving U S  economy has failed to galvanize the consumer discretionary sector so far this year  but a recent rally in restaurant stocks as the holidays approach could herald happier days ahead for other retailers 
The S P 500 consumer discretionary sector index is up about 3 percent for the year  with only the S P energy index performing worse 
One recent ray of sunshine  however  has been the performance of restaurant stocks  The Dow Jones U S  Restaurants   Bars Index index has risen about 4 percent since the beginning of September  The S P 500 consumer discretionary sector index is up less than 1 percent for the period 
Usually restaurant stocks correlate well with other retailers  but at the moment consumers are showing a preference for dining out over buying apparel  said Oscar Sloterbeck  senior managing director at Evercore ISI 
Shares of Buffalo Wild Wings Inc  Domino s Pizza Inc  Darden Restaurants Inc and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc have all risen sharply since the beginning of September 
A broadening job recovery and lower gas prices are encouraging middle income consumers to dine out again 
 The quickest path to the consumer might be through their belly   said Michael Arone  chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston  Other discretionary stocks will also see an effect  but with a lag  he said 
While the better performance at restaurants may have more to do with an increased check size for the average diner  there is a growing belief that consumer discretionary companies will see more spending thanks to lower energy prices 
The average price of a regular gallon of gasoline is  2 914  down from  3 186 a month ago  in the longest sustained decline for prices since 2008  according to AAA 
This is likely to boost consumer discretionaries in the next couple of months  said Charles Sizemore  chief investment officer at Sizemore Capital Management 
Retailers reported strong sales in October in an encouraging sign for the sector  Friday data showed 
Traders in the options market  however  do not seem to be expecting fireworks from the retail sector this holiday season 
The 30 day implied volatility  a gauge of the risk of large moves in a stock  for the SPDR S P retail fund was at 16 percent on Friday and in the 16th percentile of its 52 week range  Livevol Inc data shows 

 With overall volatility low  if consumer spending through the holiday season turns out to be better than forecast that would be a big win for anyone making that bet in the option market   said Ophir Gottlieb  chief executive of Los Angeles based Capital Market Laboratories
