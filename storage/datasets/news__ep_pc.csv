4573,226088,EP_pc,Kinder Shows The MLP Model is Changing,opinion,"This week Kinder Morgan  N KMI  did the right thing  after doing the wrong thing last year  By slashing their dividend they finally acknowledged that the MLP model of returning most free cashflow to investors and issuing new equity to finance growth doesn t work in the C corp structure they adopted in 2014  The square peg jammed in the round hole  Typical corporations pay out around a third of their profits in dividends and fund most growth with internally generated cashflow  KMI is conforming  Their mistake was committed last year  see Kinder s Blunder   as was ours in not recognizing it sooner 
KMI isn t an MLP  but they were once and most MLP investors also hold KMI  In many cases this is because they used to hold MLPs Kinder Morgan Partners or El Paso Energy Capital Trust I  N EP pc  before they were rolled up into KMI last year  We reduced our KMI position in recent months in favor of more attractively valued names  but KMI affects investor sentiment so much that we re all invested in KMI whether we own it directly or not  The MLP model isn t broken  It retains its advantage in holding energy infrastructure assets since its freedom from corporate income tax gives it a lower cost of capital  MLP distributions continue to be tax advantaged to investors  The MLP GP still looks like a hedge fund manager  see Energy Transfer s Kelcy Warren Thinks Like a Hedge Fund Manager   KMI abandoned all this for the C corp structure but kept operating like an MLP 
KMI s operating performance in 2015 hasn t been much different than expected a year ago  They budgeted  4 8BN of Distributable Cash Flow and are coming in at  4 6BN  EBITDA of  8BN  coming in at  7 5BN  Down 5 6   because they re not immune to crude oil prices  but no matter  Like their MLP cousins their stock price has sunk as investors look ahead to substantially worse operating performance next year  It may turn out that way but you won t find much support for that view from recent financial reports or company guidance  Plains All America  PAA  expects rising EBITDA next year and in 2017  at which time they plan to resume annual distribution increases  They could be wrong  crude oil could drop to  30 or lower   the Goldman forecast    and PAA may cut its distribution  We don t expect it but can no longer rule it out  Meanwhile  Plains GP Holdings LP  N PAGP  yields 9 4  based on its October 2015 dividend  which was  21  on a year ago   Energy Transfer Equity s  N ETE  CFO Jamie Welch was on CNBC noting their 7 5  yield  based on their last dividend   37  on a year ago  and predicting continued  albeit slower  growth 
But MLP stocks have collapsed this year so something must be badly wrong  Certainly the volatility of their securities has jumped  and investors will tread more warily for some time as a result  Most fundamental analysis and company guidance are severely at odds with market prices  The two will eventually reconcile 
An alternative interpretation is that the market is rejecting the industry s plans to finance its growth through issuing new equity and debt  KMI s problem is not unique  they re just bigger  more leveraged and have a more extensive list of growth projects than others  They tried to solve it by becoming a C corp and thereby accessing a bigger pool of investors  Their dividend cut was the traumatic acknowledgment of the problem 
It s easy to dismiss today s sellers as mistakenly expecting deteriorating operating performance next year  What s more interesting though is to ask where are the new investors who ought to find current values compelling  Their absence  which has allowed yields to drive higher  may signal that MLP investors don t want to provide the financing that s needed  The pool of traditional  K 1 tolerant investors isn t big enough to provide the new capital  An industry with decent operating performance and substantial growth plans ought to be funding more of that growth internally  Examining operating performance and distribution coverage is clearly not the solution to establishing the security of a payout  A company s growth plans and its commitment to them is just as important  KMI may not be the last company to accept this reality  Continued high yields on MLPs reflect a diminished appetite from traditional MLP investors to finance growth and make the use of equity financing increasingly uneconomic 
Many MLP management teams and investors  including us  believed MLP investors would willingly accommodate this growing appetite for capital  Smaller  retail investors were tapped via ETFs  mutual funds and other products that avoided K 1s  albeit in many cases inefficiently   But this class can sometimes be flighty  momentum investors and they have been leaving  The MLP structure is the cheaper legal entity through which to finance energy infrastructure  but the market is coming up short of enough interested capital 
We may be transitioning to a different type of security  with lower payouts that grow faster and more internally financed growth  It s not what original MLP investors signed up for  The shift is painful 
Casualties so far include investors who interpreted the shocking price collapse as portending something worse and sold as a result  We re most certainly not in that category  but our reputation as market timers has not emerged unblemished  and maintaining MLP exposure throughout 2015 hasn t been fun  It may not get any better for some time  Nonetheless  from where we sit last week looks like the low for the year in the sector  Of course  we ve put in the year s low numerous times already  and I for one possess the tire tracks across my back as evidence  Humility can be expensively learned  While the industry s prospects are good  the financing model may be shifting to one of lower payouts  less reliance on external finance and greater use of internally generated cashflow ",2015-12-14,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kinder-shows-the-mlp-model-is-changing-375664,375664
