6667,228182,THRM,Will Clean Energy ETFs Bounce Back ,opinion,Clean or renewable energy stocks have seen choppy trade since a couple of months as investors are fleeing high growth and high beta stocks on valuation concerns and profit taking activity  While the sluggish trend that stemmed from the broad sell off could continue in the near term  the long term outlook seems bright  This is especially true as global warming and high fuel emission issues are leading to rising popularity of clean energy sources  The demand for renewable energy  in particular solar and wind  is rapidly growing for electricity generation in the U S  As per the Energy Information Administration  EIA   renewable electricity generation in the U S  would grow by an average 1 9  per year until 2040 and total of 69  over 28 years  from 2012 2040   The alternative energy sector is seeing a global boom led by China  Europe  the U S  and Japan  and might outpace the rising shale oil and gas business in the coming years  The depletion of fossil fuel reserves  higher oil and gas prices  new and advanced technologies  and more efficient alternative energy applications have made clean power more viable  injecting optimism into the sector  Moreover  the sector is well placed in the top 13  as per the Zacks Industry Rank  suggesting bullish fundamentals for the green stocks in the coming months  Investors seeking to ride out this surging trend in the space could tap the beaten down stock prices in the form of ETFs given that America continues its green energy efficiency  Below  we have highlighted three ETFs that are not restricted to one source of energy but provide diversified exposure to various green energy sources PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy Portfolio Fund  PBW  This product follows the WilderHill Clean Energy Index and targets the stocks  which focus on greener and generally renewable sources of energy  as well as technologies that facilitate cleaner energy  The fund has amassed  205 3 million in its asset base and sees solid volume of more than 446 000 shares a day  Expense ratio came in at 0 70   The ETF holds about 56 stocks in its basket and is pretty well spread out across various securities  as each make up for less than 3  of total assets  Gentherm  THRM   Polypore International  PPO  and Maxwell Technologies  MXWL  are the top three elements in the basket  From a sector look  the focus is on information technology firms  42    but industrials and utilities also receive double digit allocations  PBW was down about 4 8  over the past one month First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund  QCLN  This fund provides exposure to clean energy companies across a wide range of industries  including solar power  biofuels  advanced batteries  as well as the installation of new technological systems  It tracks the Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy Index and manages assets worth  164 3 million  It charges 60 bps in fees per year while volume is good at over 125 000 shares  suggesting a relatively tight bid ask spread  In total  the product holds 50 securities in its basket with largest allocations to Linear Technology  LLTC   First Solar  FSLR  and Tesla Motors  TSLA   These firms combined make up for 23 2  of total assets  From a sector look  technology firms dominate this ETF  accounting for nearly two thirds of the assets while industrials round off to the next spot  QCLN lost over 4  over the trailing one month period but has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or  Buy  rating with a  High  risk outlook PowerShares Global Clean Energy Portfolio  PBD  This product provides global exposure to the stocks that focus in on greener and generally renewable sources of energy as well as technologies that facilitate cleaner energy  It can be done by tracking the WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index  Holding 105 stocks in its basket  the fund is widely spread with no single security holding more than 2 04  of PBD  The product is skewed toward technology and industrials  32 4   with over 32  share each  while utilities also receive a sizable allocation  In terms of countries  the U S  makes up about one third of the portfolio  followed by China  14 4   and Germany  6 1    The product has been able to manage assets worth  91 6 million and trades in solid volume of more than 446 000 shares per day  Expense ratio came in at 0 81   The ETF lost nearly 0 3  in the trailing one month period and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or  Hold  rating with a  High  risk outlook Bottom Line A pullback in the alternative ETFs is definitely a buying opportunity for long term investors given favorable green energy trends  Additionally  investors should note that many alternative energy funds still must go a long way to reach their all time highs  suggesting more room for upside in the coming months ,2014-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-clean-energy-etfs-bounce-back-212873,212873
7073,228588,THRM,This Red Hot Retailer Just Won Our  Buy  Rating,opinion,"On the merits of a surprisingly strong performance since mid May  the retail sector just inched into positive territory for the year 
Investment salvation  however  remains a long way off 
Coach  NYSE COH  is still the year s biggest dog of the S P 500  down about 39   Whole Foods  NASDAQ WFM   Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY  and Best Buy  NYSE BBY  are each down over 20  
Analysts are blaming the sector s poor performance on the polar vortex from earlier this year 
Some are even predicting a big rebound 
Everyone loves a turnaround play  right 
Well  before you invest alongside the Ralph Laurens and Calvin Kleins of the world  have a look at this chart 
A word of caution  though 
If you re in the retail business  this chart will likely ruin your day 
Last week s U S  jobs report was better than expected 
The U S  economy added 288 000 jobs in June  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Even better  the unemployment rate fell to 6 1   the lowest level since September 2008 
Americans are presently enjoying the best five month stretch of job creation since early 2006 
Spells of unemployment are getting shorter  too 
Back in late 2009  the average unemployment stint was 25 weeks  Today  it s only 12 weeks 
All of this good news has helped push the Dow past 17 000 for the first time in history 
Yet one chart in the jobs report is downright scary  and doesn t bode well for any sustained rally among retailers 
As it turns out  wage growth remains dreadfully muted  In fact  the labor force is earning the same amount it was in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis 

So how can the retail sector expand when consumers  wallets aren t expanding 
As a whole  it can t 
That being said  it s never prudent to throw the baby out with the bath water 
The way to invest in the retail sector is to identify the outliers  That is  the companies distinguishing themselves with innovative products 
One such company is Gentherm Incorporated  NASDAQ THRM   which presently trades for  45 per share 
Gentherm manufactures climate controlled  heated seats and steering wheels for the automotive market 
Business is booming  with profits up over 900  in the latest quarter  Since share prices always follow earnings  no exceptions   look for Gentherm to keep on truckin  above the  50 level  and beyond 
Even though this company is part of the beleaguered retail sector  its red hot growth is enough to warrant a  Buy  rating

TASER International Inc   NASDAQ TASR  had a nice day as 12 7 million shares traded  I haven t seen that kind of volume on Taser in a long time  and it may be the biggest in years  It did reach the top of the channel at 23 34 before backing off  and may be one of the reasons why it did back off  I m looking for this stock to extend  It s headed to the high 20 s  and then the low 30 s 
Stocks on the Short Side  
The Advisory Board Company  NASDAQ ABCO  had some pretty destructive patterns  It s amazing when you see this kind of technical destruction  It has a large topping pattern  breakdown  snapback to resistance  and is now in a major key area  The long term channel  and the long  massive  couple year top pattern after the run up  could lead to a retrace  So we ll be watching this one carefully to see whether the downside potential at 35 can be chief

7076,228591,THRM,Gentherm  Waiting For This Great Growth Stock To Come Down First,opinion,"The company in focus today is number 2 on the list  so it s supposed to have a lot of growth and potential  There are lots of companies I really like from this list  The catch is that a lot of them are growth stocks so it all comes down to price 
Remember what Howard Marks says as you go through this list 

 Value investing    is supposed to be about buying based on the present value of assets  rather than conjecture about profit growth in the far off future 

Gentherm  NASDAQ THRM 
What Does the Company Do 
Gentherm is in the thermal comfort technology business with majority of the revenues coming from the automotive industry 
But their business is broken down into three segments 
Climate controlled equipment for the automotive industry  Things like heated seats and heated steering wheels where their customers are Hyundai  Ford  GM  Fiat  Toyota  Nissan and Tata Motors 
Advanced technology like air conditioning system for electric hybrid batteries 
and W E T which is a global manufacturer of automotive seat comfort systems  Although the products overlap with the Climate Controlled Seats  it operates independently
Their products are mostly options for new car purchases  Some a standard on higher end cars  but heated arm rests and doors are options 
When my wife got her car  she wanted all the options and I remember wanting to choose specific upgrades because I didn t need things like heated steering wheel  a backup camera or an auto dimming rear view mirror 
But car manufacturers are obviously smarter than me  Instead of allowing me to choose and only upgrade the bare minimum  the only option was to choose between upgrade  packages   No surprisingly  my wife loves her heated seats  heated steering wheel  back up camera and auto dimming mirror 
What s to Like
It s dependent on the auto industry and downturns will obviously affect Gentherm  But because they are OEM s and not aftermarket or branded products  car manufacturers still require a solid and proven supplier to provide those heated seats and temperature controlled cup holders 
With so many recalls of late in the auto industry  the last thing car manufacturers want to do is recall thousands of cars due to a faulty thermal electronic module that is a fire or safety hazard 
In fact  there s quite a lot to like about the business 
Gentherm s business and fundamentals actually boomed due to the acquisition of W E T in 2011  If you take a look at the financials  revenues increased by 230  in 2011 compared to 2010  Growth has come rapidly as more people started to replace their cars as we eased out of the recession 
Wide Customer Base with Significant Customers
Their customer base is spread out so it s not reliant on a single company 
Check out their list of customers 

The big names in the auto industry are all there  5 manufacturers exceed 10  of revenues and although a customer making up more than 10  of revenues looks risky  you have to understand that in the auto industry  getting a part into a car takes a very long time  A few years back  I used to monitor the testing of bluetooth audio systems for different car manufacturers  One thing I learned is that the process to get the bluetooth system into a car took about 4 years 
Unlike the mobile phone industry where suppliers are replaced in a matter of months  the life cycle of a car is much longer  A design update takes about 4 years and until then  it s highly unlikely that any significant change is released year over year 
So once you ve won a contract  provide quality items at a competitive price and it s unlikely that you ll get replaced 
Patented Technology
The business has a patent for most of their products and despite the company manufacturing  boring  products  they spend a lot of money into their technology and coming up with new things  Instead of just being branded as a heated seat company  they work to break that mold by aiming higher with thermo electric products 
Here s a look at how Gentherm has been spending money 

Compare Gentherm to peers like Johnson Controls  JCI  or Lear Corp  LEA  who don t even have an R D expense line on their income statement  I don t think it will be easy to win contracts when competing against Gentherm 
Global Supply Chain
With customers located all over the world  getting everything done in China isn t going to be efficient  Heated seats or thermoelectric units aren t small electronics you can wrap in bubble wrap and ship to your customers  These are oversize products and there s a limit to how much can fit inside a freight container  They manufacture in Mexico  Ukraine and China  This way  Gentherm can ship their stuff to the Americas  Europe and Asia efficiently  Political issues with Russia is a real threat to the Ukraine location 
What s to Dislike   Slowing Growth
Gentherm isn t a perfect company though  When the company was ranked number 2 on the list of Best Small Companies from Oct  2014  the growth rate from the data is 53   That s clearly not sustainable and it s showing up in the numbers now 
Wall Street loves growth  and if a stock with lots of growth expectations doesn t deliver or it looks like the magic growth mushroom isn t growing any further  it s not surprising to see the stock get hammered  Down about 25  from the peak compared to 0  for the SPY 
Here s the slowing growth I m talking about 

If you look at more quarters and compare between comparable quarters  Q1 to Q1  Q2 to Q2 etc  the growth rate comes out to an average of 21  over the past 8 quarters  That s high  but I don t see it being that high for 5 years 
5 years is a number I like to use as a measuring stick  It makes for objective valuation easier which I ll get to below 
Auto Industry is Cyclical
Once the recession hit  the auto stores and parts businesses rocketed up because people were delaying the purchase of new cars  Over the past few years  consumer confidence has grown and auto sales growth numbers have come a long way 
But for how long 
It s safe to say that we are no longer in the bottom of the auto cycle but more like between the middle and the peak  If car sales slow  then Gentherm will also be affected  Now I can t time when the cycle will boom or bust  so the next best thing I can do is to buy on the cheap or when there s value 
Is the Stock Cheap 
Not right now  10 years of historical numbers aren t very helpful because of the W E T acquisition  The numbers from 2011 are the most useful and is what I m basing my views on  Here s a look at the value ratios I focus on 

Certainly not the cheapest numbers for a  below 20   I d say that an EV EBIT of 15x is about right though  A DCF isn t the best because I want at least 5 solid years of FCF data  And it s easier to see whether market expectations are realistic by using the  
Analysts are expecting an EPS of  1 87  So when I plug the number into the  using a range of 12x   17x for EV EBIT  the value is still below the stock price 

As it stands  I d like to see it fall to  30 before I get interested in buying  There s a lot of potential here  but I expect the opportunity will come when the auto industry starts to slow down ",2015-01-19,Jae Jun,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gentherm:-waiting-for-this-great-growth-stock-to-come-down-first-238948,238948
7077,228592,THRM,3 Auto Stocks Look Up In Q1 Earnings,opinion,"The auto sector is gearing up for a strong performance in the first quarter 2015 earnings season  The sector is expected to rank second among the 16 Zacks sectors in terms of year over year earnings growth and third in terms of margin growth 
The average growth rate of earnings for the sector is estimated at 32 4  for the quarter compared with a negative growth rate of 2 9  expected from all the S P 500 companies  It is worth noting that the automobile space recorded an impressive 41 8  year over year earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2014   the highest among the 16 sectors Growth Drivers The expected earnings growth in the first quarter will no doubt be fuelled by strong vehicle sales in key markets  U S  light vehicle sales increased for the fifth consecutive year in 2014  improving on the 6 year high achieved in 2013  Sales continue to drive up this year  with a 5 6  year over year increase to 3 95 million vehicles in the first quarter  Low fuel costs  an improving employment rate and reduced borrowing costs boosted sales  Further  sales in China reached an all time high of 23 5 million last year  It improved 3 9  to 6 15 million units in the first quarter of 2015  Even sales of passenger cars in the European Union improved 5 7  year over year in 2014 after six years of decline  according to the European Automobile Manufacturer s Association  The improvement continued in the first quarter with 3 5 million units sold  reflecting an 8 6  rise year over year Concerns Although the earnings of the auto sector are improving significantly  revenues are going downhill  Auto sector revenues fell 1 4  year over year in the fourth quarter of 2014 and are expected to decline 0 5  in the first quarter of 2015  Moreover  the rate of auto sales growth in China has lately seen a deceleration  By the end of 2014  the growth rate fell 7 percentage points from 2013 end  It decreased 5 3 percentage points in the January March period as well The Way to Pick Right Stocks Given the strong earnings outlook  it would be a good idea to look at some auto sector stocks when the first quarter earnings season has just been set in motion  The large number of participants in the auto industry makes it difficult to shortlist stocks that have the potential to beat earnings  This is where the Zacks proprietary methodology comes in handy  It narrows down the list by selecting stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  It helps in picking stocks that have high chances of posting a positive earnings surprise in their next earnings announcement  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   Here  we have selected 3 stocks from the automobile sector that have the right combination of elements to report an earnings beat this earnings season Allison Transmission Holdings  NYSE ALSN  has an Earnings ESP of  4 62  and a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s first quarter earnings is 65 cents per share  which reflects an expected year over year gain of 17 58   Allison Transmission has a history of outperforming earnings estimates  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of an astounding 80 51   Indiana based Allison Transmission is among the major manufacturers of commercial duty automatic transmissions and hybrid propulsion systems globally  The company also supplies various auto parts and services to customer through 1 400 independent distributor and dealer locations across the world  The company will report first quarter earnings on Apr 27 American Axle   Manufacturing  NYSE AXL  has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  3 45   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s first quarter earnings is 58 cents per share currently  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 5 26   Michigan based American Axle is a leading manufacturer and supplier of driveline systems  modules and components for the light vehicle market  The company makes axles  driveshafts and chassis components for light trucks  sport utility vehicles and passenger cars  The company is expected to report first quarter results on May 1 Gentherm Inc   NASDAQ THRM  has an Earnings ESP of  2 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s first quarter earnings is at 50 cents per share  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 50 84   Michigan based Gentherm designs  develops and manufactures innovative thermal management technologies  The company will come up with first quarter earnings on May 7 Bottom Line Investing in auto stocks that have an earnings beat potential should yield strong returns in the near term  Earnings above expectations increase investors  confidence in a stock  and lead to immediate price appreciation  Moreover  the long term outlook for the auto sector is positive  This year  auto sector earnings are expected to improve 27 3  over 2014 backed by strong global sales  According to IHS Automotive  global auto sales will improve 2 4  year over year to 88 6 million units in 2015  Other favorable factors like cheap oil and an improving economy will act as catalysts  So investors looking for long term prospects can take advantage of this buying opportunity ",2015-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-auto-stocks-looking-up-in-q1-earnings-season-249518,249518

7080,228595,THRM,Should Value Investors Pick Gentherm  THRM  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Gentherm Incorporated   NASDAQ THRM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Gentherm has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Gentherm s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks Automotive   Original Equipment industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Gentherm has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Gentherm stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Gentherm has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  THRM is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Gentherm currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Gentherm a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Gentherm is just 0 6  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  THRM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Gentherm might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives THRM a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and four down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone down by 10   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Gentherm Inc Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGentherm is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 34  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the  industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-03-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-gentherm-thrm-stock-200301444,200301444

20814,242329,THRM,Trump tariffs force tough choices at U S  auto suppliers,news,"By Nick Carey WYOMING  Mich   Reuters    Bob Roth makes no bones about his feelings towards U S  manufacturing   The co owner and chief executive of RoMan Manufacturing Inc  which makes transformers and glass molding equipment for automakers and other industries  asks callers on his voicemail   What have you done today to support U S  manufacturing    His procurement team has been under long standing orders to source all parts and materials as near as possible to his western Michigan factory  even with President Donald Trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum   But with those tariffs dragging into a new year and steel comprising a quarter of RoMan s fixed costs  Roth says his company has now begun the lengthy process of switching from its U S  suppliers to an Israeli company for a key component for its products  It is a strategic decision that RoMan and other auto suppliers have put off since the tariffs kicked in last spring  With tariffs firmly part of the landscape  some are now starting to shift their own supply chain to keep costs in check  according to more than a dozen interviews with U S  auto suppliers and industry consultants   U S  jobs impact of metal tariffs    The choice is stark for most suppliers  absorb the extra cost  pass them on to customers or find ways to slash material costs  The transformers Roth s 150 workers at RoMan produce require a magnetized steel core that is now more expensive as tariffs have allowed U S  steel producers to raise prices  The Israeli supplier has access to cheaper steel and its cores qualify as finished products  so they are not subject to tariffs   making them a cheaper alternative   We don t have the money to buy our way out problems like this   Roth said of RoMan  which has annual revenue of around  35 million   In the long run we can t afford to absorb the extra cost of tariffs   Roth says he appreciates the sentiment behind Trump s push to bring back American manufacturers jobs  but adds tariffs are  the wrong tool  because they hurt U S  firms  Trade consulting firm Trade Partnership Worldwide LLC estimated last summer metals tariffs could cost 5 000 jobs in the U S  auto industry and 400 000 jobs overall   16 jobs lost for every steel or aluminum worker hired  But so far there is little data available on how tariffs affect businesses such as RoMan because the process of switching suppliers is a long one and many manufacturers have muddled through so far  For agraphic  click   Steven Wybo  a managing director at consultancy Conway MacKenzie  said  every single auto supplier we are working with has concerns around tariffs   and he worries they come at an already challenging time for the sector   Suppliers are gearing up for a large number of vehicle launches over the next three years  an expensive business  while also bracing for an expected decline in U S  new vehicle sales  And some in the sector will bear the brunt of restructuring at  Ford Motor Co   N F  General Motors Co  N GM   which are dropping less popular sedan models   Adding tariffs to the mix can require a creative approach     RoMan  for instance  splits half of a 10 percent tariff with a Chinese customer on transformers subject to retaliatory measures against U S  manufacturers  RoMan will raise some prices 2 percent this month to partially offset rising copper prices  Warren  Michigan based Eckhart Inc   which books about  100 million in annual sales by building robots and automated tools for GM  Volvo and Tesla Inc  O TSLA  and other automakers   must absorb the tariffs or run the risk of losing out in competitive bids  So Eckhart has focused on cutting costs  including rolling out a new U S  purchasing system for raw materials  CEO Andrew Storm said   We have to fight for every single dollar of revenue that comes in the door   Storm said   So we find ways to eat the extra cost   That is why RoMan is seeking alternative suppliers to cut costs   and it takes a long time to ensure a new supplier is financially sound and can consistently hit industry standards  Months into that process  RoMan is only now validating test parts produced by its potential new Israeli supplier    You can t turn your supply chain on a dime   said Kristin Dziczek  vice president of industry  labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research  CAR    Dziczek said she gets calls  all the time  from suppliers wondering whether to overhaul their supply chain  and yet worrying that if they do  Trump may reverse policy overnight  LOSING BUSINESS The issue stretches up and down the supply chain for cars  Ford and GM have already warned metals tariffs will cost them  1 billion each in profits  setting in motion a complex dance over who foots the bill  If automakers have to cover the cost  they typically raise vehicle prices to pass it onto consumers  Just this week  a Toyota Motor Corp  T 7203  executive said industry wide tariffs have increased the average U S  vehicle price by around  600  Peter Bible  chief risk officer at tax advisory firm EisnerAmper and former chief accounting officer at GM  said suppliers making parts for less popular vehicles will have trouble passing on higher costs  Automakers will resist price increases  but will be also be wary of pushing suppliers too hard  Bible said  Problems at a single supplier can be disastrous  as Ford discovered last May when a fire at a supplier halted production of some highly profitable pickup trucks  Some suppliers have adapted quickly to cut costs   They have cost  Gentherm  Inc  O THRM   which makes climate control systems for vehicles and had revenue of close to  1 billion in 2017  a  few million  dollars  according to CEO Phil Eyler    We ve worked really fast to change supplier locations in a couple cases   he said   Mark Wakefield  a managing director at consultancy AlixPartners  said suppliers providing more commoditized parts will find adjusting harder  That s the case for Grand Rapids  Michigan based Pridgeon   Clay  which supplies stamped steel and stainless steel parts to automakers  with annual revenue of more than  350 million   Third generation owner Kevin Clay has lost business to low cost overseas competitors in India who use cheaper tariff free steel  and whose finished products are not subject to Trump s U S  tariffs  Metal tariffs have shaved 25 percent off Clay s pre tax profit  Banks still wary of his sector following the Great Recession are growing reluctant to issue loans  and his company has mothballed some spending plans and cut staff more than usual for this time of year  according to Clay  
 These tariffs have cost me business   said Clay  who describes himself as a moderate conservative who fervently believes in free trade   If the aim is to get to a tariff free world  this is a crappy way to get there  ",2019-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-tariffs-force-tough-choices-at-us-auto-suppliers-1749346,1749346
