35133,256648,COLM,Looking For An Earnings Beat  5 Top Picks,opinion,"The Q3 earnings season has been pretty decent so far  Notably  24 8  of the S P 500 companies have reported  out of which about 82 3  of companies beat EPS estimates  per the  issued on Oct 23  As a matter of fact  earnings beat or a positive earnings surprise seems to be a greater driver of stock movement 
Inside Earnings Surprise 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Out Likely Outperformers  
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10  Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20  We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20  This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe of more than 7 700 stocks to around nine 
Here are five out of the nine stocks that passed the screen 
Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM    This Zacks Rank  1 company engages in the sourcing  marketing and distribution of outdoor and active lifestyle apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment in the United States and internationally

35135,256650,COLM,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Columbia Sportswear  Boot Barn  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Upland Software And Spotify Technology,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 30  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM    Boot Barn Holdings Inc    NYSE BOOT    Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX    Upland Software Inc    NASDAQ UPLD   and Spotify Technology SA   NYSE SPOT   Looking for an Earnings Beat  5 Top PicksThe Q3 earnings season has been pretty decent so far  Notably  24 8  of the S P 500 companies have reported  out of which about 82 3  of companies beat EPS estimates  per the Earnings Trends issued on Oct 23  As a matter of fact  earnings beat or a positive earnings surprise seems to be a greater driver of stock movement Inside Earnings Surprise Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher How to Find Out Likely Outperformers  Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment

U S  stocks had barely moved over the last few weeks after a turbulent August  Despite subdued movement  both the S P 500 and the Dow have continued to hover within roughly 1  of their all time highs recently  The lack of movement likely means that investors are waiting for U S  China trade war updates 
Tuesday seemed like it was poised to match recent trading days  until the Conference Board announced after I began the video that its U S  consumer confidence index fell significantly in September  The news stands in contrast to the University of Michigan s widely cited U S  consumer sentiment index  which I touched on in the video  that showed a bounce back from August  The Conference Board news sent all three major U S  indexes down big in early afternoon trading  with the S P down 0 9   while the Dow slipped 0 65  
Meanwhile  shares of Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   continue to fall as the streaming TV firm prepares to face challenges from Disney   NYSE DIS   and Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   in November  along with current rivals such as Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   Prime  On top of that  Roku   NASDAQ ROKU   stock has been hammered since Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB   unveiled updated streaming device plans last week

35202,256717,COLM,Rising P E  An Often Ignored Trick To Pick 5 Winning Stocks,opinion,"Trying hands at bargain stocks that have a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a common practice  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why this often overlooked approach may go a long way to cherry pick some solid stocks  
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 57 
Here are five out of the 57 stocks 
Columbia Sportswear Company    NASDAQ COLM     The Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company is a global leader in design  sourcing  marketing and distribution of active outdoor apparel and footwear  with operations in North America  Europe and Asia  The fund belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 11    You can see

week s article are Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM    Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL    Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ALXN    Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY   and Shoe Carnival  NYSE CCL  Inc    NASDAQ SCVL   Use Rising P E to Pick These 5 Winning StocksTrying hands at bargain stocks that have a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a common practice  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why this often overlooked approach may go a long way to cherry pick some solid stocks  Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short

are expected to outpace the market  This investment strategy comes with its share of risks  Yet  it also brings the exciting possibility of outsized returns For years  many of Wall Street s most high performing growth stocks have emerged from the technology sector  Despite some volatility  strong earnings and impressive sales remain the story for many companies in the technology sector Now it s time to check out three tech stocks that came through our screen today that growth investors might want to consider at the moment 1  The Trade DeskThe Trade Desk is a programmatic advertising firm

35409,256924,COLM,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Eisai  Martin Marietta And Columbia Sportswear,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  June 25  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Eisai   OTC ESALY    Martin Marietta Materials   NYSE MLM   and Columbia Sportswear   NASDAQ COLM   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog The G 20 Meeting Cometh  Global Week AheadThe weekend s G20 meeting in Osaka  Japan   starting on Friday and running into Saturday   should be the week s main event  But it is a closer In advance of that  I list Reuters  five world market themes  These focus investors and trader s attention in the Global Week Ahead Away from the G20 summit  the latest themes talk about weakening consumer inflation  across the globe   tamping down policy and market rate expectations I have them in order of importance to equities  Not surprisingly  the G20 is at Number One  Rates are the next four Read on  1  Here Comes the U S  President  to a G 19 Summit It s been a pretty tumultuous first half of the year  and whether things calm down from here hinges on a June 28 29 summit of the G20 world powers  where Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to meet and hopefully resolve their differences on trade and tech At stake is a decision on whether Washington slaps import tariffs on another  300 billion of Chinese goods  a scenario that Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  says could sink equity markets as much as 4   It could also tip the balance between economic recovery and recession  as several markets  from shipping to copper  sound alarm bells Trump has bones to pick with other G20 leaders  too  He will meet Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan who is risking U S  sanctions on his country by placing an order for Russian made S 400 missile defense system  India  Mexico  Canada and Germany have also all at different times incurred Trump s wrath over trade  Most recently he complained about the  devalued  euro  which he said gave European exporters an unfair edge With more and more central banks pivoting towards policy easing  the issue of exchange rates looms large  Fears are that another currency war will further strain ties between nations  Japan says it will voice concern if currency moves elsewhere  deviate from economic fundamentals   But having just signaled readiness to ramp up stimulus  it too could find itself on the receiving end of Trump s anger Currency and trade wars aside  an actual war might be on the horizon after Trump allegedly ordered a missile strike on Iran  before rescinding it  Recent oil tanker attacks in the Gulf  blamed by Trump on Iran  also will be in focus  2  U S  Consumer Inflation Expectations Head Down  So Do U S  Rates Having struggled for years to meet a 2  inflation target   excluding food and energy costs   the U S  Federal Reserve might be forgiven for feeling a bit frustrated In what went slightly unnoticed amid all the rate cut focus at the last Fed meeting  policymakers again changed price growth forecasts   downward The median projection for year end core personal consumption expenditures  core PCE  the Fed s main gauge  was taken down to 1 8  versus 2  in the March forecasts  Headline PCE expectations dropped to 1 5   the weakest projection since 2016 May s core PCE reading  due June 28  is forecast to be steady at 1 6   But watch for revisions to the April print  The previous reading was on target  but the March level was revised lower  indicating yet more ground lost in the battle to thwart disinflation It s unsurprising  therefore  that eight of 17 Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  members see a lower Fed funds rate by end 2019  3  European Inflation Heads Down Too  So Do ECB Rate Expectations Inflation week is coming up in the Eurozone  and it will tell whether ECB chief Mario Draghi was right to fire his warning shot that more monetary easing would come unless prices started rising faster So far  years of stimulus and record low rates have failed to work their magic  and inflation has undershot the ECB s near 2  target since 2013  The rate was 1 2  in May  The bank is worried but it is a dilemma shared by policymakers in many countries  not least the United States and Japan German and Spanish inflation data is out Thursday  French numbers on Friday are released just ahead of the  flash  Eurozone reading for June But Draghi s words have made a mark  A closely tracked key market inflation gauge   the five year  five year break even forward   has shot up to 1 3   having languished at record lows at around 1 12  ahead of Tuesday s speech Economists say  real economy  indicators  wages  for instance  paint a less pessimistic inflation outlook  raising questions about whether Draghi s reaction to market based inflation measures is warranted One more reason to watch next week s inflation data closely  4  Following the Fed  the ECB and the BOJ   Other Central Banks Could Go Down the Rates Hole  But Not This Week Cutting interest rates  or at least flagging rate cut possibilities  is in vogue at the moment  And as often happens  the path trodden by the Fed  ECB and Bank of Japan is being followed also by emerging markets Mexico is reeling from a Fitch ratings downgrade and an outlook cut from Moody s and is unlikely make any moves until after the Fed Central banks in India and Russia have already embarked on policy easing  Indonesia and Philippines have signaled cuts ahead  The spotlight shifts to Mexico  Hungary  Czech Republic and Thailand which have meetings scheduled in coming days Markets will be interested in what message is signaled by the Czechs  They have been raising interest rates but some policymakers have hinted there s no need for further tightening  Hungary meanwhile is expected to put off any rate tightening plans in response to the ECB s dovish pivot  5  Can Stocks Have a Summer Lull  Please It s been an eventful year so far  Trade tensions have flared and calmed  then flared again  Mexico found itself replacing China as the lightning rod for trade tensions with Washington  only for the focus to shift back to Beijing Many central banks have made dramatic dovish pivots  re igniting market rallies  These were doused every now and then by glum growth data that sent investors piling back into safe haven and defensive bets  only to venture back into riskier waters  Add to the mix the tensions between Washington and Iran But Wall Street  at record highs  may be paying more attention to the Fed Clearly  investors are divided on how this will play out  Safe havens gold and government bonds have rewarded investors with roughly 8  returns year to date  But higher risk growth plays did well too  emerging local currency debt  for instance  delivered 8  while the S P500  Chinese stocks and Brent crude are up 20  on the year  Oil  however  has lost ground in the second quarter  hinting that worries over growth may be starting to gain the upper hand So bond markets are flagging a slowdown

35448,256963,COLM,Does PVH Corp  PVH  Have Upside Left Despite Sales Woes ,opinion,"PVH Corp    NYSE PVH   has been navigating through rough waters for a while now  thanks to softness in its Calvin Klein business  stiff competition and adverse currency fluctuations  Driven by these headwinds  shares of this New York based company declined approximately 29  in the past one year  underperforming the  s growth of 7 4  
Nevertheless  the company is benefiting from its diversified brand portfolio  particularly the Tommy Hilfiger brand  Also  it has been experiencing robust momentum in the international business  mainly backed by solid growth in Europe and Asia  Improved trends in its North American business  especially the wholesale unit  bode well 

 
Let s look at both sides of the story 
Reasons Behind PVH Corp s Dismal Run
PVH Corp is grappling with softness in the Calvin Klein business over the past few quarters  This  in turn  has been weighing on the company s consolidated sales  which dipped nearly 1  in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  PVH Corp s Calvin Klein business reported a 2  sales decline in the fourth quarter due to the inclusion of an additional week in fiscal 2017 and soft results in North America 
The segment s North America unit continues to be negatively impacted by Calvin Klein s Jeans business owing to fashion miss  Revenues for North America unit declined 7  in the reported quarter due to the aforementioned issue as well as impacts from an extra week in fiscal 2017  Moreover  Calvin Klein North America s comparable store sales decreased 1  
Apart from these  unfavorable foreign currency fluctuation is impacting the company s performance  In the fourth quarter  its sales were hurt by a calendar shift and an additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017  The company s earnings per share and operating income included negative impacts of 9 cents and  8 million  respectively  from unfavorable currency  Moreover  unfavorable foreign currency rate is expected to mar earnings per share by nearly 22 cents in fiscal 2019 and 14 cents in the first quarter 
Can Efforts Aid a Turnaround 
PVH Corp s diversified brand portfolio allows it to stay ahead of its peers  generate above average industry growth and sustain its position in the current challenging environment  Moreover  the company s approach to brand management facilitates each of its brands to develop further through effective marketing strategies  financial control and operating leverage  Based on the strength of many of its brands  particularly Tommy Hilfiger  coupled with distribution opportunities  we believe that the company is poised for long term growth 
Recently  the company agreed to reacquire the Tommy Hilfiger brand s license in Central and South East Asia from Dickson Concepts  International  Limited  The transaction is in sync with its strategy of having direct control over its brands  which also covers licensed businesses  Through the latest agreement  PVH Corp will be able to leverage growth opportunities in the Central and South East Asian region 
Further  the company expects its Asia Pacific platform to aid expansion of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Greater China  The enhancement of this brand will be backed by further investments for introducing other product lines and expanding brand presence 
PVH Corp is optimistic about the prospects in fiscal 2019  It expects fiscal 2019 revenues to benefit from the completion of pending acquisitions of 78  interest in Gazal Corporation Limited and the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Hong Kong  and certain other countries in Central and Southeast Asia from Dickson Concepts  International  Limited during second quarter fiscal 2019 
These transactions are likely to augment revenues by  150 million in fiscal 2019  As a result  the company expects 4  revenue growth  up 5  in constant currency  in the fiscal year  Further  it envisions adjusted earnings per share of  10 30  10 40 for fiscal 2019  with GAAP earnings of  8 90  9 00 
We believe the aforementioned factors to offset the hurdles and help it win back investors  confidence  Currently  the company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has a  A  which shows that it has more room to run

productivity initiatives  The company is also on track with the global cost based price increases and fixed cost reduction initiatives  Further  its North America division has been performing well However  the company is witnessing lower sales in most of the regions  except North America  Also  cost inflation and adverse currency fluctuations are major concerns In the past six months  shares of

increments and cost reduction initiatives focused on improving business efficiency bodes well  It implemented global cost based pricing for trade customers along with initiatives to cut fixed overhead expenses by  150 million in first quarter 2019  Backed by fixed cost discipline and a favorable product price mix due to pricing gains  the company reported operating margin expansion of 30 basis points in the first quarter  Moreover  it expects price mix to aid margin growth throughout 2019  with slight moderation on a year over year basis due to comparisons from higher pricing undertaken in the second half of 2018 For 2019  the company anticipates ongoing EBIT margin of 6 5 6 8   representing a 40 bps expansion from 2018  This guidance reflects 150 bps gains from price mix and net cost improvement of 50 bps based on revised industry demand and related lower production volume expectations  Further  it expects reduced cost inflation of nearly 25 bps for 2019  owing to slowed down raw material cost inflation Furthermore  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is benefiting from strength in the North America division  In the first quarter  sales in the North America segment were flat year over year and up 1 1  on a currency neutral basis  Operating margin in North America expanded 90 basis points  bps   backed by favorable product price mix despite pressures from higher costs  lower industry demand and decline in unit volume  The company expects to continue delivering strong results in the region  driven by favorable price mix and price increases despite expectations of lower demand Apart from these  Whirlpool s robust product pipeline  solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to achieve its long term goals  The company has outlined significant long term targets through 2020  backed by brand strength and product portfolio  Moreover  it aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3 5  every year  The company targets EBIT margin to

shares of this Baltimore  Maryland based company have increased approximately 24  in the past six months compared with the industry s growth of 16 1  Let s take a closer look at the aspects driving the company s performance Factors Driving the StockWith rising health consciousness  sports apparel makers like Under Armour are entering into the business of fitness gadgets and other tracking platforms to attract more customers  The acquisition of MapMyFitness  Endomondo and MyFitnessPal are in tune with the company s strategy of expanding its reach in the fitness space  Also  management is impressed with the popularity of UA HOVR  The company is now banking on three platforms   HOVR  Charge  and Micro G   to boost growth Under Armour is poised to increase its global footprint and market share via store expansion initiatives  and enhancement of the e commerce platform  In the process  it opened factory and brand stores in Canada  and China along with providing franchise licenses in many nations  To harness benefits from growth areas  it intends to consistently invest in international  women s and footwear businesses Management expects the digital platform to boost

favourable channel mix  stemming from reduced planned sales to off price networks and increased proportion of direct to consumer sales Bottom LineSoft sales in North America have been a major concern for the company  Net revenues from North America fell 5 8  during the final quarter of 2018 due to contraction in wholesale business and reduced sales to off price channel  Management projects mid single digit decline in revenues from the North America region during the first quarter of 2019  Change in business model in Latin America is also likely to hurt revenues Nevertheless  we expect the

Dividend stocks are in demand given investors  drive for higher income  In particular  the Fed has turned patient on rates hike this year  pushing bond yields lower and thus raising the appeal for dividend paying stocks 
While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio  with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields 
Why Dividend Growth 
Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that have high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation  This is because these stocks act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  Simultaneously  these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction 
Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future 
Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock

35635,257150,COLM,4 Top Stocks Thriving With Beat Potential This Earnings Season,opinion,"Now that the Q1 earnings season has started officially  there is no mystery in investors  hunt for stocks with estimate beating potential  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to play stocks that are rich in quality 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if it has been decelerating 
Also  seasonal fluctuations can come into play  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after a whole lot of research and analysis on a company s financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project its earnings  They also take a company s guidance into consideration when deriving an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own expectation as well as the market perception  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock higher right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Locate Potential Outperformers  
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is a dream that investors chase but might not always come true  One way of fulfilling it is by looking at the earnings surprise history of a company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a driver in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to exceed estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve to deliver yet another earning beat in its upcoming release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to four 
Here are the stocks 
Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM     This is a global leader in design  sourcing  marketing and distribution of active outdoor apparel and footwear  with operations in North America  Europe and Asia  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks sector  top 31    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

35639,257154,COLM,Whirlpool  WHR  Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates   Rise Y Y,opinion,Whirlpool Corporation   NYSE WHR   reported mixed first quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but sales missed the same  Notably  this marked the company s third consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise  with eighth straight sales miss However  shares of the company jumped 8 1  in after hours trading on Apr 22  This uptick can be attributed to better than expected earnings in the quarter under review  Effective implementation of price increase  margin expansion and cost containment efforts fueled bottom line growth  Also  robust margin growth at the company s North America segment despite sluggish industry demand and higher costs aided the quarterly performance  Furthermore  management raised its GAAP earnings view for 2019 Q1 HighlightsWhirlpool delivered adjusted earnings of  3 11 per share  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 04  The bottom line also increased 10 7  from  2 81 per share earned in the year ago quarter  On a GAAP basis  the company reported earnings of  7 31 per share  significantly up from  1 30 in the prior year quarter  This upside was mainly driven by gains from certain tax related items Net sales came in at  4 760 million  down 3 1  from the year ago period number  The top line also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 884 million  This underperformance can be attributed to sales decline across all the company s segments  except the North America division  On a currency neutral basis  the metric grew 1  Whirlpool Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Adjusted operating profit  EBIT  inched up about 1  to  298 million from  295 million in the year ago quarter  Also  operating margin expanded 30 basis points  bps  to 6 3   driven by favorable product price mix and restructuring benefits  Growth was somewhat compensated with cost inflation  lower unit volumes and adverse currency Regional PerformanceSales from North America remained flat at  2 5 billion  while the same grew 1 1  on a currency neutral basis  Operating profit margin expanded 90 bps to 12 3   primarily backed by favorable product price mix that was partly negated by higher costs and decline in unit volumes  In dollar terms  operating profit increased 8 3  to  312 million Sales from Latin America declined 2 6  year over year to  875 million  However  excluding currency translations  the metric grew 6 7   Operating margin of 5 1  contracted 120 bps  mainly due to adverse currency  which was offset by higher unit volumes and favorable product price mix  In dollar terms  operating income decreased 21 1  to  45 million Sales from EMEA declined 9 1  to  1 billion  Nonetheless  the metric inched up 1 6  on a currency neutral basis  Whirlpool incurred an operating loss of  21 million in the first quarter compared with an operating loss of  27 million in the year ago quarter  Decline in production levels and inventory liquidation charges in Turkey hurt the segment s performance  This was partly compensated with higher unit volumes and gains from restructuring Sales from Asia fell 17 2  to  371 million from the prior year quarter figure  Excluding currency effects  the metric also declined 11 5   Further  the segment reported operating profit of  7 million  which plunged 63 2  from the year ago period  Also  operating margin contracted 230 bps to 1 9  as gains from favorable product price mix was more than offset by decline in unit volumes and adverse productivity in China Financial PositionWhirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of  1 163 million as of Mar 31  2019  and long term debt of  4 137 million During the first three months of 2019  the company used  895 million cash in operating activities and reported negative free cash flow of  969 million  Meanwhile  it incurred capital expenditures of  85 million in the first quarter Furthermore  Whirlpool bought back shares worth  50 million and paid dividends of  73 million in the first quarter  It also announced a 4 3  hike in its quarterly dividend to  1 20 per share  Management plans to buy back shares throughout the remainder of the year 2019 GuidanceWhirlpool continues to envision adjusted earnings per share in the range of  14  15 compared with  15 16 earned in 2018 However  on a GAAP basis  it now anticipates earnings of  14 05  15 05 per share  up from the prior projection of  12 75  13 75  Markedly  the GAAP guidance includes restructuring costs of about  100 million  divestiture related transition expenses of roughly  23 million as well as gains from Brazil indirect tax credit of  127 million For 2019  the company continues to expect operating cash flow of  1 4  1 5 billion and free

35652,257167,COLM,Can S P 500 And Nasdaq Sustain Record Run  5 Top Picks ,opinion,The impressive rally of Wall Street which commenced at the beginning of this year achieved a milestone on Apr 23  The broad market S P 500 Index and tech laden Nasdaq Composite closed at an all time high level yesterday  A study of all record highs hit so far by these indexes provide some intriguing insights into Wall Street movements Wall Street Changes at Jet SpeedOn Apr 23  the S P 500 closed at 2 933 68  exceeding its previous all time high of 2 930 75 recorded on Sep 20  2018  Likewise  the Nasdaq Composite closed at 8 120 82  toppling its previous all time high of 8 109 69 on Aug 29  2018 However  it took just about 14 weeks for both these indexes to collapse to their lowest levels since 2008  on the eve of Christmas  last year  The U S  China trade conflict  a hawkish Fed and concerns about global economic slowdown resulted in a stock market rout Interestingly  a series of positive developments on the trade war front  the Fed s dovish monetary stance and sharp recovery of crude oil prices resulted in a complete turnaround of stock markets  Wall Street took merely 17 weeks to again set new record highs   Can the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite maintain their newly achieved momentum or fall victim to severe market volatility yet again Possible Sources of VolatilityOn Apr 17  both The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported that the United States and China are trying hard to reach a deal to end the prolonged trade related conflict by early May  However  if the negotiation process lingers beyond May  investors are likely to get jittery resulting in volatile trading Any change in the Fed s dovish outlook is likely to jeopardize the bull run  The Fed has decided to keep its benchmark within the range of 2 25 2 5   Recently  the effective Fed funds rate jumped to 2 44   its highest level since March 2008  At present  inflation is also under Fed s 2  target  However  a strong U S  economy may compel the central bank to hike interest rates later this year  much to the chagrin of market participants Moreover  Wall Street is susceptible to several geopolitical risks  Any tariff related concern between the United States and Eurozone  which is facing severe economic downturn  will have a contagion effect on U S  stock markets Future Looks Bright Despite Disturbing Elements     Three major economic data of March testified that the inherent strength of the economy remains intact  The ISM manufacturing data and retail sales data indicate that business investment and consumer spending remain firm  The labor market data underscores overall robustness of the U S  economy Moreover  a likely solution to the U S China trade conflict will act as a major catalyst for global economic growth  Furthermore  first quarter data showed signs of China s economy bottoming out this year  Notably  China is the largest trading partner of the United States  Finally  crude oil price is likely to remain at elevated levels in the near term owing to supply concerns from Iran  Venezuela and Libya  and significant restrictions on oil production maintained by the OPEC   Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks that are part of the S P 500 or Nasdaq Composite  We have narrowed down our search to five such companies   Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a positive   You can see  Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better and a positive Earnings ESP

35653,257168,COLM,5 Top Ranked Cheap Dividend Growth Stocks ,opinion,"Dividend stocks are in demand given investors  drive for higher income  In particular  the Fed has turned patient on rates hike this year  pushing bond yields lower and thus raising the appeal for dividend paying stocks While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  honing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio  with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields Why Dividend Growth Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that have high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation  This is because these stocks act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  Simultaneously  these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks

Can S P 500 and Nasdaq Sustain Their Record Run  5 Top Picks
The impressive rally of Wall Street which commenced at the beginning of this year achieved a milestone on Apr 23  The broad market S P 500 Index and tech laden Nasdaq Composite closed at an all time high level yesterday  A study of all record highs hit so far by these indexes provide some intriguing insights into Wall Street movements 
Wall Street Changes at Jet Speed
On Apr 23  the S P 500 closed at 2 933 68  exceeding its previous all time high of 2 930 75 recorded on Sep 20  2018  Likewise  the Nasdaq Composite closed at 8 120 82  toppling its previous all time high of 8 109 69 on Aug 29  2018 
However  it took just about 14 weeks for both these indexes to collapse to their lowest levels since 2008  on the eve of Christmas  last year  The U S  China trade conflict  a hawkish Fed and concerns about global economic slowdown resulted in a stock market rout 
Interestingly  a series of positive developments on the trade war front  the Fed s dovish monetary stance and sharp recovery of crude oil prices resulted in a complete turnaround of stock markets  Wall Street took merely 17 weeks to again set new record highs   
Can the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite maintain their newly achieved momentum or fall victim to severe market volatility yet again 
Possible Sources of Volatility
On Apr 17  both The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported that the United States and China are trying hard to reach a deal to end the prolonged trade related conflict by early May  However  if the negotiation process lingers beyond May  investors are likely to get jittery resulting in volatile trading 
Any change in the Fed s dovish outlook is likely to jeopardize the bull run  The Fed has decided to keep its benchmark within the range of 2 25 2 5   Recently  the effective Fed funds rate jumped to 2 44   its highest level since March 2008  At present  inflation is also under Fed s 2  target  However  a strong U S  economy may compel the central bank to hike interest rates later this year  much to the chagrin of market participants 
Moreover  Wall Street is susceptible to several geopolitical risks  Any tariff related concern between the United States and Eurozone  which is facing severe economic downturn  will have a contagion effect on U S  stock markets 
Future Looks Bright Despite Disturbing Elements     
Three major economic data of March testified that the inherent strength of the economy remains intact  The ISM manufacturing data and retail sales data indicate that business investment and consumer spending remain firm  The labor market data underscores overall robustness of the U S  economy 
Moreover  a likely solution to the U S China trade conflict will act as a major catalyst for global economic growth  Furthermore  first quarter data showed signs of China s economy bottoming out this year  Notably  China is the largest trading partner of the United States  Finally  crude oil price is likely to remain at elevated levels in the near term owing to supply concerns from Iran  Venezuela and Libya  and significant restrictions on oil production maintained by the OPEC   
Top Picks
At this stage  it will be prudent to invest in stocks that are part of the S P 500 or Nasdaq Composite  We have narrowed down our search to five such companies   Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a positive   You can see

107072,328587,COLM,How s Columbia Sportswear  COLM  Placed Ahead Of Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM   is slated to report fourth quarter 2019 results on Feb 6  This active lifestyle apparel  footwear and accessories provider delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12 9  in the last reported quarter  Further  its earnings have outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate significantly  on average  in the trailing four quarters The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has been stable at  1 65 per share over the past 30 days  This suggests a decline of 1 8  from the year ago period s reported figure  Nonetheless  the consensus mark for revenues stands at  952 million  indicating a rise of 5 9  from the figure reported in the year ago period  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings per share stands at  4 81  suggesting a rise of almost 20  from the year ago period s  4 01  The consensus mark for revenues stands at  3 04 billion Columbia Sportswear Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Key Factors to NoteColumbia Sportswear has been benefiting from solid continued investments in the direct to consumer or DTC business  as well as its brand enhancing initiatives  Within the DTC business  both the brick and mortar and e commerce businesses have been strong   Further  Columbia Sportswear s brand enhancing and unique marketing initiatives have been working well  and the Columbia brand is steadily gaining market share  The company earlier stated that it expects continued growth from the SOREL brand  courtesy of constant upgrades and effective strategies Apart from this  Columbia Sportswear s top line has been gaining from its solid international presence  Net sales outside the United States increased 11  during the third quarter of 2019 with growth in all international regions  The consensus mark for fourth quarter sales in Canada  EMEA and LAAP is pegged at  60 million   96 million and  177 million  compared with  55 million   94 million and  179 million  respectively  reported in the year ago period  However  due to exposure in international markets  Columbia Sportswear is prone to currency fluctuations  Management expects foreign currency headwinds of 90 bps to weigh on net revenue growth in 2019  Net sales in 2019 are envisioned in the range of  3 01  3 04 billion  which suggests growth of 7 5 8 5  year over year Additionally  Columbia Sportswear is progressing well with its Project CONNECT program  which is aimed at driving sales and earnings alongside strengthening its financial position  Project CONNECT focuses on connecting consumers  wholesale customers and international distributors with its global manufacturing partners and employees  During the third quarter  Project CONNECT aided the company s gross and operating margin growth  The company is optimistic about generating substantial financial value from this project in 2019 and beyond  For 2019  management expects earnings per share of  4 70  4 80 However  Columbia Sportswear has been witnessing high SG A costs due to increased investments to improve global DTC operations  project related expenses and other demand creation spending  Management is on track with such investments  which may have led to higher costs in the quarter under review  Also  the fourth quarter is likely to see a sharp deceleration in the rate of sales growth sequentially  as the company shipped a large portion of the fall 2019 order book during the third quarter  Also  the company expects fourth quarter earnings of  1 55  1 65  down from  1 68 per share reported in the year ago period  Management highlighted that the prior year quarter had gained from a favorable retail scenario as well as ideal winter weather What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Columbia Sportswear this time around  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the odds of an earnings beat  But that s not the case here  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Although Columbia Sportswear carries a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider  as our model shows that these

Given a dovish Fed and bouts of market volatility  investors are in search of steady income with some aspect of growth  Under such circumstances  growth focused dividend stocks make compelling plays as these not only offer dividends  but also consistently increase their payout 
In fact  dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk 
Why Growth Focused Dividends 
Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts 
Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future 
Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock 
As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 
5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 
5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 
5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history 
Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments 
Price Cash Flow less than M Industry A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 
52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight  This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  
LULU Hits News Highs on Earnings Beat  Too Late to Buy 
Earnings Announced
Lululemon is up 16  in Thursday morning trading  hitting an all time high of  171 45 after a strong earnings release  LULU announced an EPS of 1 85  beating expectations by 6 3   Posting 26  year over year growth in quarterly revenue and profits up 84  for Q4  The operational margins are up to 21 5  for the fiscal year up from 17 2  in 2017 illustrating leaner operational performance  Below you can see that 10 year revenue growth has been very consistent averaging 22  year over year and LULU stock price has increased over 3000  in the same time frame 
Lulu Story
Lululemon has ingrained its name in yoga gym culture  being the preeminent apparel provider for this category  From its inception in 1998 out of Vancouver  British Colombia  Canada  this firm has evolved into the  athleisure  cultural driver we know today  I first recognized Lulu as a women s brand for yoga pants around 2010 and would never have thought I would ever own  let alone wear  anything from this brand  Two years later I went into one of their stores  being pressured by my girlfriend  and discovered how aesthetically pleasing and comfortable their men s athletic wear was  Ever since I have been an avid enthusiast of Lulu as I know many other men have also become  Whenever I go to the gym today  it seems like 75  of the apparel I see is Lululemon branded 
Like every apparel retailer still in business  Lululemon has put a lot of focus on its e commerce segment  They had a 39  increase in direct to consumer sales  representing 26  of total revenue  The real Cinderella story comes from their in store sales growth  As brick and mortar retailers take a perceptive nosedive with numerous store closures and bankruptcies  Lululemon has found a way to not just keep its head above water but walk on it  Lulu had a 7  increase in sales on a constant dollar basis for fiscal 2018 having opened 36 new stores in 2018  including 21 stores outside the United States and is now operating in 14 different nations 
Zacks Rank
The earnings story for Lululemon is a very positive one  Earnings were previously expected to grow 14 58  in fiscal 2019 and 19 24  in 2020  but the EPS estimates are subject to change as a result of the significant Q4 beat announced yesterday afternoon  Currently  LULU is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   but I am confident that once these EPS numbers and further adjustments are priced into the model  it will rank up to a Zacks Rank  1 2  Buy  
 Conclusion
Lululemon has been a steady growth story since its IPO  I don t see a reason that this expansion wouldn t continue as they penetrate foreign markets and further captures market share from its top competitors like Nike  Under Armor and Columbia Sportswear  LULU is a sensible buy with a reasonable price earning to growth  PEG  valuation of 1 68  considering increasing growth expectations  This valuation is most useful for fast growing companies because it accounts for the expected EPS growth rate  As you can see in the chart below LULU s PEG is close to converging with the apparel industry average  Be careful not to buy the peak though  considering its at an all time high today  I would wait for the earnings hype to settle before putting a position on 
 Columbia Sportswear is another apparel retailer who has been able to win the fight against the category decline  This business has been able to post consistently strong growth on both top and bottom lines   A forward PE of 23x makes a fast growing retailer like Columbia an equitable buy  COLM just posted robust earnings back in February beating the consensus by almost 33  pushing them into a Zacks Rank  1  Buy

107117,328632,COLM,3 Outdoor Focused Retail Stocks To Buy Right Now  YETI  DECK  COLM,opinion,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains dives into three sports and outdoor focused retail stocks that look like strong buys right now 
Everyone knows Nike   NYSE NKE    Adidas   OTC ADDYY    and Under Armour   NYSE UAA    Along with these industry giants  Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   has risen to prominence as the broader athleisure market continues to expand  In fact  LULU is coming off blowout fourth quarter earnings and is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   But today we are going to talk about a few companies that also appear to be strong buys right now that get a bit less love     
The first company that we dive into is Yeti   NYSE YETI    which as its name might suggest  is a cooler company that was founded in 2006  The Austin  Texas based firm sells heavy duty coolers geared toward commercial fishermen that cost as much as  1 300  Yeti s extensive line of hard and soft coolers also appeal to more everyday users and the company has expanded far beyond its original business   
Yeti products can be found in Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    Walmart   NYSE WMT   owned Moosejaw  Bass Pro Shops  and many other retailers in the U S   Canada  Australia  and elsewhere  The firm also opened its first flagship store in 2017 and has seen its direct to consumer business boom over the last year  Plus  Yeti has seen its stock price soar over 70  since going public in October 2018  and its positive earnings outlook helps it earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment 
Along with Yeti  shares of Deckers Outdoor Corporation   NYSE DECK   have surged 63  over the last 12 months to crush the S P 500  The company owns Ugg  Teva  and other brands  The firm s Q3 fiscal 2019 net sales popped 7 8   driven in part by massive growth from its HOKA ONE ONE running and hiking footwear unit  HOKA ONE ONE could continue to expand through innovate partnerships  which includes working with an up and coming Lululemon competitor  Deckers Outdoor is also a Zack Rank  1 that boasts some other solid fundamentals 
The last company we dive into is likely the most familiar  Columbia Sportswear   NASDAQ COLM   is up 36  over the last year and 24  in 2019 alone  The recent positivity stems from impressive Q4 earnings and solid full year results  Columbia s sales surged 14  in 2018 to a record  2 80 billion  This is a good sign for the company  which also owns Mountain Hardwear and Sorel  as it fights to compete with V F  Corporation s   NYSE VFC   The North Face and Canada Goose   NYSE GOOS

107142,328657,COLM,Here s What To Expect From Lululemon  LULU  Q4 Earnings Wednesday,opinion,"Shares of Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   slipped over 2  Tuesday  in a sign that some investors might be nervous about the yoga apparel and athleisure giant s fourth quarter 2018 financial results that are due out after the closing bell on Wednesday  Some might be worried that Lululemon could fall short of revenue estimates after Nike   NYSE NKE   missed North American sales projections 
Overview 
Overall  Lululemon stock has climbed 18  this year to outpace the S P 500 s 12  jump and its industry s 14  average expansion  As we mentioned at the top  shares of LULU closed regular trading down 2 06  at  143 56 on Tuesday  which marked a 13  downturn from their 52 week high of  164 79 
Nike saw its stock price sink late last week after it failed to match Wall Street estimates for its largest market  Despite the miss  Nike seemed to prove its strength and the stock is likely to bounce back  Investors should also note that Nike executives are ready to expand their women s focused offerings in the athleisure age that has helped Lululemon stock soar over 120  in the last two years 
The Vancouver based firm has diversified far beyond its yoga gear into outwear  shoes  accessories  as well as more work appropriate and fashion focused offerings for both men and women  Plus  Lululemon signed NFL quarterback Nick Foles earlier this month as its first men s ambassador  an effort the firm hopes will attract consumers away from more traditional sportswear brands such as Nike  Adidas   OTC ADDYY    and Under Armour   NYSE UAA    Meanwhile  its men s and women s jackets now compete against Canada Goose   NYSE GOOS    V F  Corporation s   NYSE VFC   The North Face  Columbia Sportswear   NASDAQ COLM    and other higher end brands 
Lululemon is also testing out a new loyalty program and has jumped into the self care industry with offerings such as deodorant and moisturizer  LULU management also raised its quarterly guidance earlier this year on the back of strong holiday period sales  With that said  investors and Wall Street will likely pay close attention to its e commerce expansion and any updates on its growth in key Asian markets   
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Lululemon s Q4 revenue to climb 23 9  to reach  1 15 billion  which would come in above Q3 s 21  top line growth  Meanwhile  the firm s full year 2018 revenues are projected to surge approximately 23  from fiscal 2017 s  2 65 billion to reach  3 27 billion  Last year  total full year revenue popped 13  
At the bottom end of the income statement  Lululemon is projected to see its adjusted Q4 earnings surge 30 8  to touch  1 74 a share  Plus  the athletic apparel company s full year EPS figure is expected to soar 44 4  to reach  3 74 a share  Once again  this would top 2017 s adjusted full year earnings growth of 21  
Investors should also note that LULU has seen some positive earnings estimate revision activity recently  which includes two positive revisions for Q4 in the last 60 days  Furthermore  Lululemon boasts an impressive history of earnings beats  with a 19 5  average quarterly EPS surprise over the trailing four periods 
 
 
Bottom Line
Lululemon is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  based in large part on its recent earnings estimate revision activity  LULU also boasts an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  Maybe more importantly in the short term  Lululemon stock trades pretty heavily around earnings  This means that LULU could soar or slump based on Wednesday s earnings release 
LULU is scheduled to release its Q4 and full year 2018 financial after the closing bell on Wednesday  March 27  So  make sure to head back to Zacks for a complete breakdown of its actual metrics

107149,328664,COLM,5 Athletic Stocks That Deserve Your Attention Right Now,opinion,Fashion trends especially in clothing  footwear and lifestyle come and go but there is one trend that is defying this cyclical pattern  Sports apparel has been right at the top of the global fashion category for some time now Consumers  penchant for athletic apparel grew after athletic and casual fashion categories merged to create the vastly popular athleisure category  The athletic apparel category progressed by leaps and bounds mostly due to consumer awareness about the products and brands since 2008

trend rather than a cyclical fashion trend  And this new trend will surely help athletic apparel stocks climb north in the near term  Sporting goods  in particular  posted the strongest gain in

5 Athletic Stocks that Deserve Your Attention Right Now
Fashion trends especially in clothing  footwear and lifestyle come and go but there is one trend that is defying this cyclical pattern  Sports apparel has been right at the top of the global fashion category for some time now 
Consumers  penchant for athletic apparel grew after athletic and casual fashion categories merged to create the vastly popular athleisure category  The athletic apparel category progressed by leaps and bounds mostly due to consumer awareness about the products and brands since 2008  according to Piper Jaffray s Taking Stock with Teens Survey  And that mindshare continues to grow

manufacturer of apparel for men  women and children has a mixed earnings surprise record in the trailing four quarters  Let s see what s in store for the company this time around Hanesbrands Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days at 47 cents  which reflects a decline of 9 6  from the year ago quarter s figure  Nonetheless  the consensus mark for revenues is  1 716 million  which depicts a rise of 4 3  from the year ago quarter International Strength  Buyouts Likely to AidHanesbrands should continue benefitting from strength of its international segment  which contributed nearly 34  to the company s net sales in the third quarter of 2018  Sales for the segment improved 11 3   up 15  at cc  to  619 4 million  Organic sales rose 10  on a currency neutral basis  on the back of strong Champion sales across Europe and Asia  Contributions from the acquisition of Bras N Things   32 million  also fueled International sales  Management is focused on making investments and innovations internationally  which are major drivers for the impending quarter In fact  many other apparel companies like Ralph Lauren   NYSE RL    lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   and Columbia Sportswear   NASDAQ COLM    among others  have been gaining from strong international business  Coming back to Hanesbrands  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the International segment is currently pegged at  579 million for the fourth quarter  reflecting a rise of 6 2  from the year ago quarter s tally Strategic buyouts have been another vital strategy favoring Hanesbrands  top line and portfolio growth  To this end  contributions from acquisitions  Bras N Things and Alternative Apparel  played a solid role in augmenting Hanesbrands  third quarter sales  Evidently  these acquisitions contributed  48 million to the top line  Apart from this  the company has largely been gaining from contributions from Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that were acquired in 2016  Talking of Champions business  Hanesbrands  Activewear and International segments have long been gaining from splendid performance by its Champion business  During the third quarter  Global Champion sales surged 30  on a currency neutral basis  backed by double digit increases in Asia  Europe and the United States  Management expects Champion sales growth to remain sturdy and continue driving Hanesbrands  Activewear and International units  performances in the fourth quarter Such well chalked efforts along with impressive organic sales are expected to aid the company s top line in the upcoming quarterly release  For the fourth quarter  management projects net sales of  1 70  1 74 billion  The mid point of this range reflects year over year growth of nearly 5   On a constant currency basis  organic sales are projected to improve 3 5  in the quarter  at the mid point of the projected sales outlook  Can Hurdles be Offset Hanesbrands has been bearing the brunt of raw material cost inflation  Although gross margin grew in the third quarter  it was hurt by increased input costs to some extent  Unfortunately  raw material inflation is likely to persist  which is a threat to margins  Also  the company has been battling soft sales at its Innerwear segment for quite some time now  In third quarter 2018  Innerwear sales fell 6 9  to  599 7 million  due to softness across both Innerwear Basics and Innerwear Intimates  Hanesbrands anticipates its Innerwear sales to remain flat in the fourth quarter Additionally  adverse currency movements weighed on Hanesbrands  sales in the third quarter of 2018  Further  currency woes along with impacts from Sears Holdings  bankruptcy led management to tighten its outlook for 2018  Notably  management now expects currency to have a greater negative impact on net sales compared to what was projected earlier  Management now envisions adjusted earnings of  1 69  1 73 per share  lower than the previous guidance of  1 72  1 80  This includes negative impact of nearly 5 cents from Sears Holdings  bankruptcy and currency woes  These factors make us cautious about Hanesbrands  upcoming release as well Although Hanesbrands has been focusing on enhancing savings through the Project Booster program  it is less likely to completely offset the aforementioned hurdles  Markedly  management predicts adjusted earnings of 46 50 cents in the fourth quarter compared with 52 cents in the year ago quarter What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model doesn t show that Hanesbrands can beat

107203,328718,COLM,Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day Columbia Sportswear  Seagate Technology  Fujifilm  Mosaic Company And KT,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 11  2018    Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM   as the Bull of the Day  Seagate Technology   NASDAQ STX   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Fujifilm   OTC FUJIY    The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS   and KT Corp   NYSE KT   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Columbia Sportswear Company stock has outperformed the larger apparel market over the last year  The historic outdoor apparel and footwear company is also coming off a strong third quarter and its growth prospects appear impressive  Plus  we are in the midst of the holiday and winter shopping period that could help boost the outdoor focused firm Overview Columbia  which was founded in 1938  currently sells everything from trail running shoes to winter jackets  The company also owns fellow outdoor and sportswear brands Mountain Hardwear  Sorel  and PrAna  Together  the Columbia family of brands competes against V F  Corporation s The North Face  Canada Goose  Nike  NYSE NKE   REI  Patagonia  Lululemon and others Columbia is coming off a better than expected quarter that saw its revenues jump 6  to a record  795 8 million  driven by a 9  surge in U S  sales an 15  expansion in Europe  the Middle East  and Africa  On top of that  the firm s direct to consumer sales surged 23  to reach  251 million  Overall  the company s namesake brand popped 7  to hit  640 9 million  Going forward  Columbia s continued collaborations with upstart fashion brands and its ability to capitalize on the current retro trend are likely to help spur growth Price Movement Now that we have covered some of Columbia s recent performance and overall business  it s time to dive into its stock price movement to help investors gain a better understanding of what is going on  Colombia  which closed Q3 with 135 U S  retail locations  has seen its stock price soar roughly 97  over the last three years  This blew away its industry s 4  climb and S P 500 s 31  jump Year to date  shares of COLM are up 23   which looks even more impressive considering that the S P is down 1 5  on the year  Columbia saw its stock price dip marginally Monday to close regular trading at  88 a share  down approximately 8  from its 52 week high of  95 74 per share Valuation COLM stock is currently trading at 21 8X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a premium compared to its industry s 17 8X average  But we already know that Columbia stock has destroyed its industry recently to help justify this forward P E Plus  the chart below helps us see that COLM s valuation picture is not that stretched at the moment compared to where it has traded over the last five years  Columbia has traded as high as 29 6X during this stretch  with a five year year median of 22X  Shares of Seagate Technology have tanked over the last six months despite solid top and bottom line results  Now  the data storage solution firm s outlook might prolong STX s current decline Overview Seagate Technology s portfolio includes both consumer and enterprise level data storage products along with data protection and recovery solutions  The Cupertino  California headquartered company saw its fiscal 2018 revenues pop roughly 4  to reach  11 18 billion  Plus  Seagate s fiscal first quarter which it reported in early November revenue jumped 14  to  2 99 billion Stock Price Movement Despite Seagate s solid fiscal 2018 and impressive top line growth last quarter  shares of STX are down roughly 5  in 2018  This falls below the S P 500 s 1 5  dip  but comes in well above its industry s 17  decline  Shares of Seagate closed regular trading Monday down slightly to  39 81 per share  which marked a 36  downturn from its 52 week high of  62 70 a share With that said  we can see that Seagate stock  on the whole  has performed very well over the last decade  Cleary though  shares of STX have experienced a ton of turbulence over the last five years ValuationMoving on  investors should note that Seagate s current valuation picture appears relatively solid  STX stock is currently trading at 7 2X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates  which marks a discount compared to its industry s 10 3X average and the S P s 15 7X  Over the last five years  shares of Seagate have traded as high as 15 2X  with a five year median of 10 2X Outlook   Earnings Trends  Moving on from Seagate s valuation picture  it s time to see what to expect from the firm s future earnings and revenues since a good forward P E doesn t count for that much if it s not accompanied by growth The company s current quarterly revenues are projected to fall by 6 2  from the year ago period to hit  2 73 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  the company s full year revenues are expected to sink by just over 3  to  10 85 billion At the bottom end of the income statement  Seagate s adjusted current quarter earnings are expected to dip 4 1  to reach  1 42 per share  Meanwhile  the data storage giant s earnings are projected to plummet nearly 18  in the following quarter and slip 1 3  for the year  Furthermore  Seagate has only experienced downward earnings estimate revision activity recently  on top of its projected top and bottom line declines  This means that some analysts are even less optimistic about Seagate s earnings picture than they were not too long ago Additional content Putting an End to Themes  Global Week AheadThere are noted trading weeks   ones where we mark the beginnings of stock market themes such as the beginning in a multi year series of interest rate hikes  the start of a new presidency  or an inexorable turn in stock index price trends Then  there are the opposite of such trading weeks  These are weeks where we mark   sometimes in hindsight   the end of long term themes This Global Week Ahead is the latter This week  we likely mark the end of a two year long Brexit ordeal  as it collapses under a vote in the U K  House of Commons  We will more surely see the end of multiple years of  QE  in Europe  On Thursday  the ECB winds down its scrap of monthly bond buying which remains in place Perhaps  traders also foresee the end of Fed rate hikes   sooner than expected a few short weeks ago   as the U S  Treasury yield curve inverts  This series of 25 basis point steps began three years ago  in December 2015  Stress from a self created U S  China trade war clearly hit domestic earnings and stock markets Do we shortly mark the end to this very long and winding U S  business cycle  That s the next signpost traders  and investors  actionable thoughts have headed That call looks to this economist to be premature  by at least six to nine months  However  those logic systems coded for major momentum share price shifts usually trade in front of them  about that length of time The following are five big underlying Reuters world market themes  These are most likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders alike in the Global Week Ahead  1  Where Does the U S  Treasury Yield Curve Go from Here With major parts of the U S  economy visibly slowing  the U S  risk free Treasury market has reacted in a striking manner The 10 year yield is close to falling below the two year yield  which would mark the curve inversion that has preceded every recession in the last 40 years  Signs of slowdown have persuaded markets to bet the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases next year But wait  Inflation is running at a 9 month high  annual wage growth a 9 1 2 year high and unemployment at a near 50 year low  So November inflation  due on Dec  12th  will play into how Fed Chair Jerome Powell frames the path of future tightening So it remains to be seen where the curve goes from here  There are reasons to believe it can steepen and reasons to believe it will invert  Depending on how the incoming data looks   stagflation  anyone    the Fed s view on where neutral is and what its policy response should be in the coming months is far from clear  2  On Tuesday  the House of Commons Votes on BrexitBuckle up for another wild week of Brexit mayhem on sterling and other UK focused markets Britain s parliament is   at the time of this writing  at least   set to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May s Brexit transition deal on Tuesday  but the chances of it being approved don t look good What happens then is    well  that s the thing  there are multiple possibilities  all with very different implications A really heavy defeat would make it difficult for May to carry on  She has staggered through the last couple of years  taking direct hits from all angles  but this could finally bring her down Could that then lead to a hard Brexiteer taking the reins and ripping up the deal  Perhaps  and sterling won t like that one bit  But it s equally possible that whomever takes over would press pause on the whole process by withdrawing the so called Article 50 notice  That could even raise the chances of a second public Brexit vote and that could send sterling soaring  3  On Thursday  the ECB Wraps Up Its  QE  ProgramThursday marks the end of an era for the ECB  which is set to formally announce the end of its three year long  2 6 trillion euro monetary stimulus scheme For markets  that s a done deal  What matters now is what the ECB does in the face of a weakening economy  global trade tensions  Brexit and Italy Policymakers have already been floating ideas to support the economy when QE ends  One suggestion is for multi year loans to banks What investors appear more certain about is that the ECB will struggle to bring interest rates back up to zero percent  especially if a U S  slowdown encourages the Fed to pause its rate hike cycle  Money market pricing suggests investors expect roughly a 75 percent chance of an ECB rate hike in 2019  But that s down from 100 percent just a few weeks ago  4  What Happens with the Global Oil and Commodity Prices So much for the U S  China trade truce If financial markets are any guide  the detente between Washington and Beijing struck over a steak dinner at the G20 in Buenos Aires barely lasted 24 hours  Fears of global trade war and economic slowdown are again driving investor sentiment On oil markets  that signals that a 30  price slump since October has little hope of reversing Oil has also had to contend with OPEC  whose failure to agree on output cuts accelerated the slump in prices  pushing the Brent below  60 barrel and WTI futures close to breaking below  50  The possibility of small cuts by the likes of Russia and Kazakhstan are unlikely to save the day  given the magnitude of market oversupply Commodities overall are in some trouble  Copper is near three week lows  having lost around 15 percent so far in 2018  while most base metals are down a similar amount  And the Australian dollar   a good proxy for commodities  Chinese demand and world trade   was the worst performing major currency in the world all week Without good news on the trade front  a respite is unlikely  5  What of the Latest Chinese Trade Data The United States has just reported its trade deficit hit a 10 year high in October  and its politically sensitive deficit with China surged to a record  43 billion  So markets will watch to see how China hawks in the Trump administration react to China s trade data due for release The data should show whether China is carrying out promises to import more from America  It could well provide more grist for the mill   both for U S  officials pushing for more reasons to punish China and for investors skeptical of the trade ceasefire The prospect of a Chinese growth slowdown is keeping investors edgy  So while trade contributes far less to the country s GDP than it used to  there are other data points coming up too   credit growth and retail sales among others   which should show how badly the economy is hurting from the trade war Top Zacks Stocks

NC based company have lost approximately 33   underperforming the  and S P 500 s decline of 28 7  and 19 4   respectively Factors Affecting Hanesbrands  PerformanceHanesbrands has been struggling with soft sales at its Innerwear segment for quite some time now  In third quarter 2018  Innerwear sales fell 6 9  to  599 7 million due to softness across both Innerwear Basics and Innerwear Intimates  Sales at this segment have also declined a respective 3 4  and 3  in the second and first quarter of 2018  Hanesbrands anticipates its Innerwear sales to remain flat in the fourth quarter  Moreover  operating profit fell 13 6  on account of raw material inflation and sluggish replenishment orders Also  the company is witnessing raw material inflation since the past few quarters  Although gross margin expanded in the third quarter  it was hurt by increased input costs to some extent  Unfortunately  raw material inflation is likely to persist  which is a threat to margins Moreover  currency woes along with impacts from Sears Holdings  bankruptcy led management to tighten its outlook for 2018  Management now expects currency to significantly hurt net sales compared to what was projected earlier  It envisions adjusted earnings of  1 69  1 73 per share  lower than  1 72  1 80 guided earlier  This includes a negative impact of nearly 5 cents from Sears Holdings  bankruptcy and currency

Activewear and International units  performances in the fourth quarter  In fact  management anticipates Champion sales to jump at a significant double digit rate  courtesy of solid order bookings through the first half of fiscal 2019  Moreover  the company expects Champion sales outside the mass channel to surpass  1 3 billion in 2018 Further  the company is making strategic acquisitions to strengthen its business portfolio  which is one of its core strategies for long term growth  To this end  contributions from acquisitions  Bras N Things and Alternative Apparel  played a significant role in augmenting Hanesbrands  third quarter sales  Evidently  these acquisitions contributed  48 million to the top line  Apart from this  the Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia acquisitions in 2016 proved beneficial for the company Moreover  Hanesbrands launched a multi year program in first quarter 2017 to drive investment for growth  minimize costs and increase cash flow  This program is likely to boost the company s Sell More  Spend Less  Generate Cash strategy for additional gains  mainly from the global commercial and supply chain scale through acquisitions  By 2019  this project

along with other cash flow drivers  like synergies from buyouts and diversified revenues  are anticipated to help Hanesbrands achieve its cash flow target of an annual run rate of  1 billion by the

107220,328735,COLM,Support And Resistance,opinion,"A stock  ETF  Index etc   price is either in a trending phase or in a consolidation period  During strong trend periods prices move uninterrupted from one price level to another  During consolidations prices move in both directions without producing any meaningful or sustained price change and will form well defined support and resistance areas on the charts  A support range represents a concentration of demand  and a resistance range represents a concentration of supply 
A resistance level is an approximate level or fairly well defined price range  where previously advancing stock meets resistance in the form of strong selling  A support level is an approximate level or price range where a preceding decline meets support  in the form of strong buying  A possible explanation for appearance of such well defined price boundaries in the form of support and resistance can be the fact that the public tend to remember previous levels the stock has traded 
The longer the time which the stock spent in that range  therefore  the greater the number of transactions  the more important that range becomes for future technical consideration  In applying support and resistance study to price charts  the weekly scale time frame is usually more informative than daily scale  Weekly charts show much more plainly the levels at which congestion of significant duration appeared 
Rectangle chart pattern is a good case study for the application of support and resistance analysis  The upper and lower boundary lines of this familiar and dependable chart pattern are resistance and support levels  Until a decisive breakout occurs in either direction  the boundaries of the rectangle chart pattern  given that it is well defined with almost perfect horizontal boundaries  provides good reference levels  When a breakout occurs  penetrating one of these levels  that level changes its role  If it is an upward break  the resistance becomes support and if it is a downward break the support becomes resistance 

888 Holdings  LON 888  formed a year long rectangle chart pattern in 2016  The boundaries of the rectangle was well defined and the price respected the support and resistance areas  While one can have several different strategies to analyze and trade such price changes  two strategies that are common are 

Trading price changes between the boundaries  Once the price chart forms a well defined  more than 2 tests of resistance or support around the same price range  pattern boundary  one can buy at support and sell at resistance 
Trading price change after a breakout is confirmed  Breach of the chart pattern boundary usually changes the balance between the supply   demand and results in a directional move  Buying at the breakout or selling at the breakdown confirmation is another common strategy 


Another good example for a well defined trading range is the price chart of Columbia Sportswear Company  NASDAQ COLM   The multi month trading range on Columbia Sportswear was discussed in the May 27  2017 report  The analysis drew attention to a possible rebound from the lower boundary  support  of the 17 month long range at 52 levels to the upper boundary at 63 levels  Columbia Sportswear price continued to remain between the boundaries  Tech Charts Global Equity Markets report will continue to bring member s attention such chart pattern developments as well as breakout opportunities 
In October 2017  after consolidating in a well defined trading range for several months  Columbia Sportswear completed the multi month long rectangle with a decisive breakout  Lengthy consolidation periods are usually followed by strong directional movements  The chart below features the strong trend period that followed the breakout  Columbia Sportswear was highlighted in the breakout alerts section ",2018-11-07,Aksel Kibar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/support--resistance-200356082,200356082

when it reported third quarter 2018 results  However  in spite of higher sales  earnings declined year over year  This can be attributed to rise in cost of goods sold  occupancy costs  and increased

RCKY   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Consumer Confidence Leaps to 18 Year Highs  5 Big GainersConsumers in America are currently most confident in almost two decades  courtesy of a healthy labor market and strong economic outlook  Their assessment of present day conditions is positive  making them confident of continued economic expansion  at least in the near term More the confident consumers are about their well being  the more will they spend  Thus  things are currently looking up for consumer discretionary companies that are poised to gain on signs of renewed strength in consumer spending Consumers in High SpiritsU S  consumer confidence soared to its highest in 18 years in October  per the Conference Board  a business research organization  The consumer confidence index climbed to 137 9 from 135 3 in September  Economists had expected the consumer index to slip to 134 9 in the month Nonetheless  the key economic indicator that measures attitudes on future economic prospects registered its best reading since the fall of 2000 and is not too far from the all time high of 144 7 reached that year People s confidence in the present situations improved from 169 4 last month to 172 8 this month  matching the highest level reached in December 2000  The future expectations index also moved from 112 5 to 114 6  an 18 year high What Drove Confidence Household optimism was largely driven by robust labor market  suggesting strong economic expansion in the near future  Lynn Franco  senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board  said that American s assessment of present condition has improved  mostly because of solid employment growth  She added that  the expectations index posted another gain in October  suggesting that consumers do not foresee the economy losing steam anytime soon  rather  they expect the strong pace of growth to carry over into early 2019  The U S  unemployment rate is currently at a 49 year low of 3 7   the lowest since December 1969  Meanwhile  the country s total output of goods and services expanded at an annualized pace of 3 5  in the third quarter  In fact  the economy in the last two quarters recorded the fastest six month growth in four years and is on track to hit Trump administration s annual growth target of 3   If that happens  it would be the best yearly performance since 2005  two years before the Great Recession Why Does Consumer Confidence Matter Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting consumer spending for the next three to six months  More the confidence households generate  the more will they spend  Notably  consumer spending accounts for roughly 70  of the U S  economy  which isn t a petty number These numbers influence companies  production schedule  particularly consumer discretionary items  In fact  consumer discretionary items including durable goods  apparel  entertainment and leisure  and automobiles are mostly affected as spending plays a major role in determining revenues 5 Stocks to Gain From

107307,328822,COLM,Michael Kors  KORS  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Michael Kors Holdings Limited   NYSE KORS    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 10 5  over the past month  KORS hit a new 52 week high of  70 in the previous session  Michael Kors has gained 8 7  since the start of the year compared to the  1 2  move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 11 1  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 7  2018  Michael Kors reported EPS of  1 77 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 4 71  
For the current fiscal year  Michael Kors is expected to post earnings of  4 77 per share on  4 68 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 03 per share on  4 98 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 21  and 6 39   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
While KORS has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Michael Kors has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 14 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 11 8X versus its peer group s average of 12 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 05  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Michael Kors Holdings Limited Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Michael Kors currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Michael Kors fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though KORS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Michael Kors Stack Up to the Competition

107346,328861,COLM,PVH Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of PVH   NYSE PVH    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14  over the past month  PVH hit a new 52 week high of  162 79 in the previous session  PVH has gained 18 3  since the start of the year compared to the 0 3  move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 8 8  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on March 28  2018  PVH reported EPS of  1 58 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 48 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6 56  
For the current fiscal year  PVH is expected to post earnings of  9 1 per share on  9 58 billion in revenues  This represents a 14 61  change in EPS on a 7 48  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  10 4 per share on  9 97 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 14 34  and 4   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
PVH may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for PVH  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
PVH has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 17 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 13 1X versus its peer group s average of 12 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 37  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective PVH Corp  Price and Consensus   Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  PVH currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if PVH fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though PVH shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does PVH Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of PVH have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including G III Apparel Group  LTD    NASDAQ GIII    Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM    and Ralph Lauren Corporation   NYSE RL    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 34  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PVH  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2018-04-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pvh-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200305358,200305358

107378,328893,COLM,Zacks com Highlights  Jones Lang LaSalle  Lockheed Martin  Owens Corning  Westlake Chemical And Columbia Sportswear,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 28  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc    NYSE JLL    Lockheed Martin Corp    NYSE LMT    Owens Corning Inc    NYSE OC    Westlake Chemical Corporation   NYSE WLK   and Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Smart Beta Dividend Stocks to Buy NowThough the prospect of higher than expected rates hike and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal of dividend stocks  applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility  revenues  earnings  momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules based indices  And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy Why Dividend Growth Strategy Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock

107435,328950,COLM,Dick s  DKS  Stock Dives To New 52 Week Low  Sports World Sinks,opinion,"Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   stock sunk to a new 52 week low on Thursday  less than a week before the struggling sporting goods retailer is set to report its second quarter earnings 
Other retailers  including industry powers and sporting goods chains  have already reported rough second quarter results  Now  investors are preemptively dumping Dick s as the e commerce squeeze seems to be in full effect 
Last week  outdoor sporting retailer Cabela s   NYSE CAB   posted earnings of  0 53 a share  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 57 per share and marked a 10 2  year over year decline  The company also fell short of revenue targets and dipped 4 2  from the year ago period  due in part to a 9 3  decline in comparable store sales 
Today  citing the decline at Cabela s  UBS analyst Michael Lasser remained cautious about Dick s ahead of its earning report 
 While DKS probably benefitted from fewer competing stores in 2Q  we think there were offsets that weighed on its same store sales      DKS has had a lot going on  creating the potential for distractions due to the TSA and Golfsmith conversions  the Second Skin launch  vendor consolidation and management turnover  Still  it should be better positioned than other sporting goods retailers to weather the storm  
Last quarter  Dick s earnings jumped 8  year over year to  0 54 a share  The retailer s revenues increased by 9 9  to  1 8 billion  but sales fell below our Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  consolidated same store sales climbed 2 4  from the previous year 
Those first quarter numbers don t scream looming disaster for Dick s on their face  but recent earning estimate revisions  spurred by slow overall growth   the company s full year Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings dropping to  3 67 from  3 71 a share  On top of that  our consensus estimate for the company s fiscal 2018 earnings has fallen from  4 08 to  3 97 per share 
The Pittsburgh based retailer faces less direct brick and mortar sporting goods competition today  but online retailer Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    has sapped some of the company s moneymaking power 
Shares of the sporting goods chain plummeted over 7  on Thursday to reach a new 52 week intraday trading low of  33 49 a share  Dick s is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The company is set to report its second quarter earnings results on August 15

Dick s sank to a new 52 week low on Tuesday morning  touching  27 92 a share after investors hammered the company s stock  The brick and mortar sports chain carries almost every major sportswear company in the world  and its 0 1  same store sales growth has some investors running scared 
Many other companies in the retail sector shared Dick s fate  while some were able to avoid the downturn  But companies with big exposure inside of the sporting goods chain were not so lucky

Shares of Adidas  DE ADSGN  AG   OTC ADDYY   and Puma SE   V PUM   both fell marginally on Tuesday  with Puma experiencing the bigger drop off  Callaway Golf   NYSE ELY   and Columbia Sportswear   NASDAQ COLM   slid by around 1 50  
Nike  NKE  stock dipped 2  on Tuesday morning  Recently  the powerful sportswear company has made moves to sell more directly to consumers with its new Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   partnership  Nike has also tried to bolster and revamp its own online and mobile presence with the Nike app and the Nike SNKRS app  which hopes to create an easy shoe shopping experience 
Still  chains such as Dick s provide Nike the invaluable service of allowing Nike consumers the ability to try on higher end footwear and sneakers  Shares of Finish Line   NASDAQ FINL   and Foot Locker   NYSE FL    which cater even more to the high end sneaker lover  both plummeted over 4  on Tuesday on the back of Dick s fall  
Under Armour  UAA  stock took one of the biggest hits in the sportswear world on Tuesday  Shares of the struggling company sank 4 41  and touched a new 52 week low of  17 81 a share  The company has large exposure in Dick s and does not yet have the online and direct to consumer outlets to combat the retail drop off 
Sports Retailers Fall
Slow growth  missed Wall Street expectations  and a poor full year outlook from one of the biggest sporting goods chains helped send shares of fellow sports based brick and mortar companies down as well 
Dick s retail peer Hibbett Sports    NASDAQ HIBB   stock sank 11 65  to hit a new 52 week low of  12 23 a share  Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods   NASDAQ BGFV   also struck a 52 week low of  8 43 per share after falling over 5   Outdoor sporting retailer Cabela s   NYSE CAB   stock fell 4 92   
Lululemon   NASDAQ LULU   stayed above the fray on Tuesday and actually saw marginal gains 
Bottom Line
The retail squeeze is seemingly in full effect as Amazon and e commerce companies siphon more and more sales from traditional retail  Dick s hit a 52 week low and the company s shares have fallen almost 50  in the last year  If the retail chain does not begin to make possibly drastic changes to its game plan  it could eventually get knocked out of the retail world 
Nike  Under Armour  and other sportswear companies must also remain diligent in this ever growing digital world in order to remain highly competitive in the minds of investors

107437,328952,COLM,Dick s  DKS  Stock Climbs Despite Downgrade,opinion,"Shares of Dick s Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS   rose slightly on Thursday despite earning yet another analyst downgrade this time from Cowen 
Cowen  citing all too familiar reasoning  lowered its rating for the struggling sporting goods retailer from  outperform  to  market perform   Cowen s John Kernan also reduced his Dick s price target to  28 a share from  31 a share 
 Despite Dick s Sporting Goods remaining the preferred destination when shopping for sporting goods according to the Cowen Consumer Tracker  slowing N  America sales growth rates from key vendors Nike and Under Armour  along with increased emphasis on the brands  own direct to consumer platforms will pressure Dick s Sporting Goods SSS  same store sales  growth and margin profile    
The Cowen note also cited the fact that Nike   NYSE NKE   and Under Armour   NYSE UAA   represent 32  of Dick s overall sales  But by now  Dick s investors are likely well aware of the company s exposure to these brands and understand that analysts are worried that sportswear companies will transition further into direct to consumer sales 
 With Nike s plans to shortly begin direct selling on Amazon  Dick s Sporting Goods likely three largest vendors  Nike  Under Armour and Adidas  DE ADSGN  will all be selling directly on Amazon   Kernan continued   Sporting good and athletic apparel and footwear industries are currently over inventoried and the environment is as promotional as we have ever seen  
Yet  shares of Dick s climbed 1 09  in morning trading  So why did the Pittsburgh based retailer s stock climb slightly in morning trading after this downgrade 
It is very possible that this line of reasoning simply no longer scares Dick s investors because they have heard it all before 
The company s stock price has plummeted by more than 50  since the start of 2017  due in large part to poor sales and lower than expected earnings  And the reason for the drop off has to be attributed to an overall shift in the retail landscape  especially when considering that Dick s faces less direct brick and mortar sporting goods competition overall 
Today s marginal gain could be a sign that investors are just trying to wish away the Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   malaise  However  as Wal Mart   NYSE WAL   begins to show true staying power in traditional retail s fight against online outlets  maybe investors hope that Dick s can act quickly to change its current trajectory by pivoting some of its business models

What has investors concerned is the deceleration of that growth since Q1 16  On a quarterly basis  Skechers  year over year sales growth hit a recent low of only 5 8  in Q4 16 but has since picked back up reaching 16 9  in its latest reported quarter source  finbox ioGoing forward  analysts forecast that the company s sales will reach  5 570 million by fiscal year 2021 representing a five year CAGR of 9 3   For Q3 17 expected to be announced on Thursday  the consensus Wall Street estimate of  1 070 million implies 13  YoY growth 
It s important to note that analysts often look at companies as either thriving  surviving or dying  Analyzing a company s revenue growth can help distinguish between these stages  Growth of over 10  typically signifies the core business is doing very well and the company s products and services are in demand  On the other hand  a decline of 10  or more is an indicator that the company is in real trouble and that its products or services are losing demand and or becoming irrelevant 
When looking at the stock s recent performance  you would assume the business is deteriorating  But in reality  the Skechers brand remains strong and is still growing at a very healthy pace 
Domestic Wholesale Headwinds Overblown
Skechers breaks out its top line into three segments  Domestic Wholesale  International Wholesale and Retail  includes e Commerce   In the early part of 2017  analysts downgraded the stock due to increasing concern over the domestic wholesale business and rightfully so  Skechers posted four straight quarters of declining growth from Q2 16 to Q1 17  However  during this same period  total sales continued to grow on average of 8 8  
Then last quarter  Q2 17  Skechers reported that its Wholesale business grew by 6 4  YoY while total sales increased by 16 9   a level the company hadn t reached since Q1 16  It appears the company is ready to get back to its high growth levels while concern over the Wholesale Business were overblown 
To put it plainly  the athletic retail business is shifting and companies are just beginning to adapt  Many active wear brands such as Nike  NYSE  NYSE NKE   Under Armour Inc A  NYSE UAA  and Skechers are focusing on selling their products directly to consumers rather than through distribution partners  For example  Skechers retail business  includes e Commerce  sales grew 28 7  in Q2 17  This is impressive when comparing to Nike and Under Armour who grew their direct to consumer sales by 18  and 20   respectively 
It appears consumers still want Skechers  products while management is just shifting its delivery method  Furthermore  growth in China has been a bright spot for the company selling 3 7 million shoes last quarter  61  growth   Management previously projected that China would contribute  500 million in sales for fiscal year 2017  Expect further confirmation on this number Thursday 
Why Value Investors Are Bullish SKX
Skechers  stock trades at a highly attractive valuation  Applying Wall Street estimates to ten separate cash flow analyses implies that shares are 45  undervalued  Additionally  the Wall Street consensus price target of  32 45 per share implies 33  upside source  Skechers is also highly attractive on a relative basis when compared to several of its publicly traded peers  Foot Locker  NYSE FL   Deckers Outdoor Corporation  NYSE DECK   Wolverine World Wide Inc  NYSE WWW  and Columbia Sportswear Company  NASDAQ COLM  
The company s LTM EBITDA multiple of 7 4x is below comparable companies DECK  10 1x   WWW  16 5x  and COLM  11 3x  while only above FL  2 7x   Similarly  Skechers  LTM P E multiple of 17 1x is only above FL  6 4x  and well below DECK  94 2x   WWW  32 3x  and COLM  21 8x  source  Furthermore  most Wall Street analysts have either upgraded or reiterated their buy ratings on SKX shares since June  Citigroup  NYSE C  pointed to positive signals such as a new product cycle as well as indications that the footwear maker is capturing market share from competitors 
Then Cowen s John Kernan called Skechers its top small midcap idea in a note to clients highlighting management s potential to leverage down S G expenses in the back half of the year 
source  As previously mentioned  Skechers has healthy growth prospects as a result of strong company owned retail store trends and international opportunities  However  while positive revenue trends are important  equally important is the ability to convert those revenues into real earnings or cash flow  Note how Skechers  EBITDA margins have recently come under some pressure in the chart below source  For the full year 2017  analysts forecast that the company s EBITDA will drop 5  to  427 million implying a margin of 10 6   However  the consensus forecast also has Skechers  EBITDA margin getting back to over 12  by fiscal year 2019 
I built a five year discounted cash flow  DCF  downside case for Skechers below assuming that margins do not pick back up  stay at 10 6  into perpetuity   I also assume sales growth declines to 3 5  by 2021  a weighted average cost of capital  WACC  of 9 5  and a terminal growth rate at the end of the forecast period of 2   This results in a fair value of  27 59 which still implies nearly a 15  margin of safety source  The downside DCF analysis illustrates just how undervalued shares of Skechers appear 
Overall  the Skechers  brand remains strong in a tough retail market as illustrated by its ability to achieve healthy growth figures  Whether or not the company beats its estimates on Thursday  this footwear retailer has nice upside on a long term basis and should be further considered by value investors

107443,328958,COLM,Factors Impacting Columbia Sportswear s  COLM  Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Columbia Sportswear Company   NASDAQ COLM   is scheduled to release third quarter 2017 results on Oct 26  after the markets close  While the company is expected to gain from sturdy performance in its Europe direct business and prAna brand  results are likely to be hurt by declines across the United Sates  Latin America and Asia Pacific regions  As a result  both top and bottom lines depict a probable year over year decline 
Let s now have a closer look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Europe Direct Business and prAna Brand to Continue Growth 
Columbia Sportswear has been witnessing stellar performance in its Europe direct business for some time   In fact  the wholesale  brick and mortar and e commerce channels across the Europe direct business have depicted sustained growth during the first half of 2017 
Owing to this trend  analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from the Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  regions to inch up 2 7  year over year to  75 million  Similarly  net sales from Canada are also expected to grow 1 3  to  76 million owing to strong performance of the company s core brands 
From a brand perspective  we note that Columbia Sportswear s prAna brand has been attracting a large consumer base  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenue for prAna brand is  38 1 million  almost in line with the prior year figure 
Headwinds Impacting Revenue 
Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from United States and Latin America and Asia Pacific  LAAP  regions to decline 2 5  and 0 9  respectively during the third quarter 
Of late  the company has been facing challenges in the domestic region  especially in the wholesale front  mainly due to store closures  bankruptcies  or plans to restructure or liquidate  This has led to lower than expected advance orders for fall 2017 from U S  wholesale customers 
Revenues in the LAAP region have also witnessed challenges lately  owing to lower sales in Korea  There has been a general shift of consumer preference away from outdoor apparel and accessories in Korea  Also  the consensus estimate of revenues for the SOREL brand is  86 million  reflecting a year over year decline of 1 8  
Owing to such headwinds  analysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of  734 9 million for the said quarter  down 1 4  from the year ago period 
These ongoing challenges are also visible in Columbia Sportswear s share price performance  Shares of the company have underperformed the  in the past six months  The stock has returned 4 8  compared with the industry s gain of 10 9    

 
Earnings Expectations
The expected decline in revenues across some of its core regions and brands has led to a bleak earnings view  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 15 for the third quarter depicts a decline of 2 7  from the year ago period 
However  estimated earnings for 2017 of  2 78 per share depict a growth of 2 2  from the year ago figure and are in line with management s guidance of  2 74  2 84  Estimates for both the quarter under review as well as fiscal 2017 have remained stable over the past 30 days 
We note that Columbia Sportswear has delivered an average positive surprise of 12 3  in the trailing four quarters  Notably  the company s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 18 straight quarters

DKS is currently trading at  56 78 per share with a quarter earnings ESP of 2 38   according to Zacks  The implication is that DKS will see a terrific rise in sales and profits for its upcoming Q3 earnings reports 
The news of rival Sports Authority going under back in March has only benefited DKS   that   Dick s executives told analysts on an earnings conference call last month that Dick s had acquired the rights to more than 30 Sports Authority stores  as well as the chain s brand name  customer list and online operations   This gives DKS an immense advantage  as they are able to acquire many  if not all  of their old rival s customers 
In terms of the Cubs affect on DKS  the influence has already begun   that   Factoring in sales from the local market  sources say the Cubs  first 24 hours of sales should approach  70 million in retail sales  which would make it the hottest postgame championship market of all time   The demand for Cubbies gear has never been higher  The gear is being issued out by many major brands  including New Era Cap  Nike   NYSE NKE    Majestic  Columbia   NASDAQ COLM    and many more 
What gives DKS the competitive advantage over other retailors is the fact they carry all of these brands  unlike many other competitors  DKS Q3 earnings will be released on November 15th  Its worth mentioning that the Zacks Rank currently has DKS at a  1  Strong Buy  and VGM grade of  A   With positive earnings in the past two quarters  added to the fact the Cubs championship will boost sales  concludes that DKS will likely see a positive Q3 earnings report for investors  Look for Zacks Rank on the 15th after DKS reports its earnings to see where their updated rank stands

107459,328974,COLM,Lululemon s Stock Could Drop 20 Percent,opinion,"Earnings Expected Wednesday
Lululemon  NASDAQ LULU  is expected to report earnings on Wednesday after the market closes  The activewear company beat its earnings estimates last quarter  Q3  and shareholders enjoyed a quick 10  price increase  However  shares have been trending lower since the beginning of 2017 as headwinds appear to be growing stronger 
While the stock trades lower  Lululemon still appears to be approximately 20  overvalued when applying Wall Street estimates to ten separate finbox io cash flow analyses 
Analysts Turn Bearish
On March 9th  Canaccord Genuity  that the company s apparel strategy could become less effective  citing new consumer preferences in denim  The investment bank conducted a survey which found that 18  of respondents expected to buy fewer pairs of Lululemon pants this year 
More recently  Macquarie s Laurent Vasilescu highlighted  ahead of earnings  One interesting point that Vasilescu noted was saturation 
Christine Day was Lululemon s CEO from 2008 2013 and under her management  the company often claimed that the total addressable market  TAM  in North America was 300 350 stores  As of last October  there were 287 stores in the North American region  Hence  the company may be reaching saturation 
Another interesting point Vasilescu highlighted was the elevated level of inventories on the company s balance sheet  Inventories make up a significant portion of Lululemon s net working capital  NWC  and is also the main reason for the steady increase in NWC over the last eleven quarters  shown below  

In two years  the company s NWC has more than doubled   330mm in Oct  16 vs  163mm in Oct  14   The increase in inventories and NWC implies that it is simply taking longer for Lululemon to sell its apparel   not a great sign 
Margins Declining From Intense Competition
Outside of shifting consumer preferences  Lululemon also faces stiff competition from established activewear providers like Athleta  Columbia Sportswear  NASDAQ COLM   Gildan  NYSE GIL   Nike  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour  NYSE UAA   In addition  the company will have to compete with new entrants like Ivy Park which is a new activewear brand co founded by Beyonc  in 2016  Investors long LULU need to keep a close eye on Beyonc  s new brand 
Approximately 75  of Lululemon s revenue is derived from the US  way up from 50  in 2012   The US population stands at approximately 325 million people  Compare this to Beyonc  s 98 million followers on Instagram which is roughly 30  of the entire US population  While the demographics of Beyonc  s followers are unknown  her reach and influence on US consumers undeniable 
Stiff competition from established activewear brands have already started to erode Lululemon s  as shown below  New entrants like Ivy Park will likely diminish margins even further 
Conclusion
Several analysts have recently turned more bearish on Lululemon and rightfully so  Competition has pushed inventory levels higher and margins lower 
In addition  finbox io s valuation analyses imply that the stock is 20  overvalued on purely a fundamental basis  Value investors may want to stay clear of LULU before the company reports earnings on Wednesday ",2017-03-27,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lululemon’s-stock-could-drop-20-percent-200180328,200180328
107462,328977,COLM,Here s Why Skechers Has 15  Upside Before Earnings,opinion,"Earnings Expected Thursday
Skechers USA Inc  NYSE SKX  is expected to report earnings on Thursday after the market closes  The footwear company has generally traded lower over the last eight quarters in the face of decelerating revenue growth  The stock had been gaining some momentum in the early part of the year until Susquehanna s Sam Poser  to a negative rating on March 29th  Poser warned that domestic wholesale growth would fall short of investor expectations and the stock has since fallen 15  
We illustrate below why value investors should view this as an opportunity as SKX is highly attractive at its current trading price 
Valuation Shows Big Upside Potential
Skechers appears over 30  undervalued when applying Wall Street estimates to nine separate finbox io cash flow analyses  This compares favorably to the average analyst price target of  28 44 which implies 15  upside 
SKX is also highly attractive in a relative basis when compared to several of its publicly traded peers  Foot Locker  NYSE FL   Deckers Outdoor Corporation  NYSE DECK   Wolverine World Wide Inc  NYSE WWW  and Columbia Sportswear Company  NASDAQ COLM   The company s forward EBITDA multiple of 6 9x is equal or below all of the comparable companies  FL  6 9x   DECK  7 6x   WWW  10 1x  and COLM  10 8x  
It s important to note that Skechers  forward EBITDA multiple has traded on average at 10 0x over the last three years according to S P CapitalIQ  That s 3 1x above its current multiple of 6 9x 
Domestic Wholesale Headwinds Overblown
Skechers breaks out its revenues into three segments  Domestic Wholesale  International Wholesale and Retail  includes e Commerce   Susquehanna s negative downgrade  which has since been upgraded to neutral  was due to increasing concern over the domestic wholesale business  This segment has reported three consecutive quarters of year over year declines 
These declines are not ideal but as of the latest fiscal year  December 2016   this business now represents only 33  of total revenues and merely 28  of gross profit before tax  Domestic wholesale generates the worst margins for the company  international   44  and retail   58    So why not focus on the higher growth segments that also produce superior margins 
Put simply  management is focusing on these high growth channels  On the Q4 16 earnings call  management stated its focus on China and that the international wholesale segment is expected to be  in 2017  It currently only represents 39  
Furthermore  strength in its international wholesale and retail segments have been able to offset domestic declines  The chart below highlights Skechers performance over the last eight quarters Yes  total revenue growth has declined from the  30  achieved last year but revenues are still growing at a healthy level 
Management also continues to improve its inventory management as illustrated in the chart above  Inventories make up the most significant portion of Skechers  net working capital  NWC  and has steadily decreased  as a percentage of revenue  over the last nine quarters  The decrease in NWC implies that it is taking less time for the company to sell its shoes  A positive sign that management is gaining a better understanding of its operations which has helped boost its cash balance to  719 million 
DCF Downside Case Shows 15  Upside
The discounted cash flow  DCF  analysis below is a downside case and is a helpful tool that illustrates Skechers nice upside potential 
The average Wall Street estimate for 2019 projected revenue and EBITDA is  4 790 million and  603 million  respectively  When bringing these figures down by more than 15  and well below any Wall Street estimate for that year  the analysis still indicates that the stock is 14  undervalued 
SKX Conclusion  Fundamentally Undervalued
Skechers  recent 15  price drop seems irrational when analyzing the financial performance of the entire business  Yes  the domestic wholesale business is under pressure but only makes up a quarter of the shoe company s underlying profits  Furthermore  the international wholesale and retail segments are more than offsetting the domestic headwinds 
Skechers also just released  designed for  young woman who want to go from the office to the yoga studio to dinner in comfort and style   The new product line will likely improve Skechers top line going forward as Management has partnered with four high profile healthy living ambassadors who have a combined social reach of over 1 2 million followers

Our proven model does not conclusively show that Duluth Holdings will beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Duluth Holdings has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 6 cents  Although the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Duluth Holdings  a Belleville  WI based company  specializes in casual wear  work wear and accessories for both men and women 
Duluth Holdings has been delivering higher year over year net sales for the last 28 consecutive quarters  backed by strong sales in both the direct and retail segments  The direct net sales gains reflect positive customer response to the company s national advertising and digital marketing campaigns  which stemmed an increase in website visits  The rise in retail net sales was driven by the opening of retail stores  along with growth in comparable store sales 
However  the company is also incurring huge operating expenses due to the implementation of a new warehouse management system and advertising campaigns  In addition  a highly promotional retail environment is putting pressure on margins 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the consumer discretionary sector that investors may consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
NutriSystem  Inc    NASDAQ NTRI    with an Earnings ESP of  1 64  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Gildan Activewear  Inc    TO GIL    with an Earnings ESP of  2 08  and a Zacks Rank  2

107492,329007,COLM,If It s September  It s Time To Buy,opinion,"Are you looking for a new swimsuit  Because September is the best month to buy one 
Stores have to get rid of their inventories  And with summer vacations officially over  beachwear is the furthest thing from everyone s mind right now 
Retailers are just finishing up back to school pushes  From here  they ll turn to Halloween before skipping right past Thanksgiving to unload Christmas decorations and inventory 
In the first quarter  retailers take inventory  If it s not in the store  they don t have to count it  So  to save themselves a whole lot of trouble    and boost cash    they liquidate as much as possible through inventory reduction sales 
That s why February is the perfect time to buy a new winter coat  It s also the best time of the year to buy suits 
September Is Your Friend
September is just  one of those months  for the markets  Since 2000  it s been a real thorn in the sides of investors 
The S P 500 has fallen nine times in the month  with five of those losses being more than 5  

Currently  the S P is down about 2  in September  That s right in line with what we saw in September 2014 and September 2015 
In fact  in four out of the past six years  September has yielded a negative return  It follows August  a month where the S P has ended lower five out of the past seven years  And before August  we had June    a month when the S P has seen declines in seven out of the past 10 years 
You could view this all in a negative light  sure  But if you re an investor looking to buy shares of companies at some of their lowest levels possible  September is your friend 
From the second half of the month through October  it s the prime teriod to buy shares in a variety of sectors  Especially businesses that do poorly during the summer months but really heat up during the winter 
For example  let s look at quarterly revenue for Columbia Sportswear Company  NASDAQ COLM  
About To Make A Killing

We can clearly see that the third and fourth quarters are the periods when Columbia makes most of its money  The outdoor apparel maker sees weaker revenue in the first quarter  And then no one is buying warm outdoor wear in the second quarter 
Shares of Columbia Sportswear are up 10  year to date  But they are 14 5  below their 2016 peak  And so far in September  they re down 4  
Looking at the company s quarterly revenue  does that come as a surprise 
In the third quarter of 2015  Columbia reported record sales of  767 6 million  In the second quarter of 2016  it reported revenue of  388 8 million  This was a record in its own right  but only a 2  increase year over year 
And it was a far cry from the 10  revenue increase seen in the first quarter    or the 14  increase seen in the third quarter of 2015 
The majority of investors simply see that revenue has been cut in half over two straight quarters  Something similar happens every year 
Again  like clockwork 
As a result  shares of Columbia tend to fall from their peak  trailing lower through the spring and summer  Which is perfectly fine with me 
I m actually looking for shares to go lower at the moment  There s a specific date on my calendar that I ve circled  knowing that the stock will have finally bottomed out  give or take a few points  
But these are the types of trades that should be on your radar now  We re talking about companies that are going to make a killing in the months ahead  And the lower the prices of shares  the better 
That s why a down month like September is really a great month  It s truly your friend ",2016-09-15,Matthew Carr,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-it's-september,-it's-time-to-buy-200153764",200153764

107515,329030,COLM,3 Retail Stocks Showing Impressive Growth This Earnings Season,opinion,"It wasn t too long ago that NIKE  Inc   NYSE NKE   reported another great quarter of solid growth in its business  The company s fiscal fourth quarter numbers beat Wall Street consensus  and its sales from continuing operations grew 11  to  7 4 billion  or 13  on a currency neutral basis 
In this market  double digit growth is significant no matter if it s in the top or bottom line  Like the last several earnings seasons  corporations are typically only beating consensus on one financial metric  either earnings or revenues   But this is enough to keep investors buying 
Under Armour  Inc   NYSE UA   blew the doors off of Wall Street consensus and the stock shot strongly higher  The company reported a surge in new apparel sales  Total revenues grew a whopping 34  over the second quarter of last year to  610 million 
Breaking it down  the company s apparel revenues grew 35  to  420 million  while footwear sales grew 34  to  110 million on new product offerings  The company experienced significant sales growth of 30  in North America  while international sales doubled  representing approximately 10  of total revenues  
Previous guidance for 2014 was for sales growth of between 24  and 25  over 2013  Management boosted this guidance to between 28  and 29   with operating income expected to grow between 29  and 30  over last year 
This time last year  Under Armour was trading around  35 00 per share  It s doubled since then  and the position has further momentum in this market  It is pricey  however  with a forward price to earnings ratio of around 60  But the stock is likely to stay this way  the business has operational momentum  and that s what the Street likes 
Columbia Sportswear Company  NASDAQ COLM  is another apparel manufacturer that just increased its guidance for the year  Total revenues for the second quarter of 2014 grew a solid 16  to a record  324 million  Management cited improving strength in both North American and European markets  and forecasted an improving bottom half of the year  both for Columbia branded apparel and  Sorel  footwear  The company will split its shares two for one on September 26  always a good development  and management expects 2014 total sales growth to be between 19  and 21  over last year  with gains in gross margin 
Columbia Sportswear is not as expensively priced on the stock market as Under Armour  instead  it s similar in valuation to NIKE 
All things considered  though  in the textile consumer goods apparel business  the numbers show a genuine improvement over last year and that s a positive development for the broader market 
I still like NIKE on price weakness for long term  more blue chip portfolios  The company offers a proven track record of solid wealth creation for shareholders and strong dividend growth  
And we re talking about double digit annual growth from a mature company and brand  which is an accomplishment for any enterprise  no matter what the sector  Forward earnings estimates for NIKE have been going up across the board and management is buying back billions of dollars of its own shares 
It s more good numbers in the consumer goods space and that is a genuinely good indicator for these stocks

107516,329031,COLM,Philip Morris Slips To Strong Sell  Cautious On FY Results,opinion,"On December 26  Zacks Investment Research downgraded Philip Morris International Inc   NYSE PM  to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  after the company witnessed sharp downward estimate revisions in anticipation of soft fiscal 2014 results scheduled to be reported in Feb 2015 

Why the Downgrade 

Almost all the estimates were revised downward for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 over the past 30 days as the company expects industry headwinds to continue in the upcoming quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2014 slipped 1  to  1 07 per share over the last 30 days  For 2014  the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined by 2  to  5 07 during the same time frame 

During the third quarter conference call  management lowered the fiscal earnings guidance anticipating currency headwinds to continue throughout the fiscal year  Philip Morris expects earnings in the range of  4 76 to  4 81 for fiscal 2014  lower than the previously guided range of  4 87 to  4 97  The lowered guidance range is also below last year s earnings of  5 26 per share 

Apart from currency headwinds  the company is experiencing declining demand for traditional tobacco products resulting from the ongoing anti tobacco campaigns  Governments around the world are hiking excise tax on cigarettes and imposing packaging and advertising restrictions on cigarette makers  We believe that the declining trend in volume will continue during the fourth quarter as well
