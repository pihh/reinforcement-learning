The firm reported earnings per share of  0 53 on revenue of  1 10 billion  Analysts polled by Investing com anticipated earnings per share of  0 56 on revenue of  1 13 billion  That compared to earnings per share of  0 51 on revenue of  1 02 billion in the same period a year earlier  The company had reported earnings per share of  0 50 on revenue of  945 99 million in the previous quarter 
The earnings miss comes as higher sales  led by the company s Reign Total Body Fuel energy drinks  were offset somewhat by higher costs that weighed on margins    
 We are pleased to report record gross and net sales in the 2019 second quarter  driven by our Reign Total Body Fuel energy drinks  which we launched in the first quarter  as well as growth in our Monster Energy  brand energy drinks both domestically and internationally   Monster said in a statement  
The company s Monster energy drinks segment saw sales grow by 9 6  to  1 02 billion 
Operating expenses for the 2019 second quarter were  282 3 million  compared with  262 6 million in the 2018 second quarter 
Gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the 2019 second quarter was 59 9   compared with 61 1  in the 2018 second quarter  with the company blaming the decline on  geographical and product sales mix as well as increases in certain other input costs   which combined to offset increased sales prices of its products sold in the United States and Canada  as well as lower aluminum costs  
The company said it would seek to launch its new Monster energy brand both domestically and abroad  
 Later this year we are planning to introduce a number of new Monster Energy brand energy drinks in the United States and in various international markets   Monster said in a statement

146736,368252,MNST,Monster Beverage  MNST  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Monster Beverage  MNST  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy drink maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 54 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8  
Revenues are expected to be  1 12 billion  up 10  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Monster Beverage 
For Monster Beverage  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Monster Beverage will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Monster Beverage would post earnings of  0 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 53  delivering a surprise of  5 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Monster Beverage doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monster-beverage-mnst-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200480338,200480338

146776,368292,MNST,Can Brown Forman  BF B  Withstand Tariff Related Perils ,opinion,"Brown Forman Corporation  displays a solid run on the brochures  owing to its robust earnings surprise trend  strong brands portfolio and product innovation  These have driven the company s strong run in the past year   Notably  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has witnessed growth of 11 5  in the past year against the industry s decline of 3 1  However  the recent softness in the stock owing to the impacts of tariffs imposed on American spirits cannot be ignored  While the company s top and bottom line performances remain favorable  the higher tariffs have taken a toll on margins due to increased costs  Consequently  we note that Brown Forman s shares have underperformed the industry in the year to date period  It displayed 15 4  gain in the period while the  grew 22 7  
 
Further  the sheer consequences of higher tariffs are reflected in the company s guidance for fiscal 2020  which is hurting investors  confidence on the stock Detailed Picture of Tariff Related WoesWhile Brown Forman delivered strong fourth quarter fiscal 2019  retaliatory tariffs imposed on American spirits partly affected top and bottom lines  The company witnessed impacts of cost of tariff on underlying net sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019  apart from impacts on cost of sales and gross margin  Notably  underlying net sales for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 witnessed negative impact of nearly one percentage point from lower net prices to distributors in certain markets to offset additional tariff related costs One key reason why tariff increases are largely hurting Brown Forman is its widespread international presence  In recent years  the company has grown footprint in international markets  which is significantly contributing to total sales  However  Brown Forman produces most spirits in the United States  which is attracting larger exports to foreign lands Notably  the company s products account for nearly 60  of the American whiskey business in Europe  resulting in large exports  Consequently  the cost of tariffs on American whiskey implemented by the European Union in response to the U S  tariff increases is hurting Brown Forman s performance  Moreover  its American whiskey strategy mainly focuses on building a market for its super premium brands  such as Gentleman Jack and Woodford Reserve in Europe  With business in Europe being a large part of the strategy  it expects the tariffs implemented by the European Union to be a hindrance for its American whiskey strategy in the near term Brown Forman s gross margin continued to be impacted by tariff related costs in the last few quarters  Notably  the company s gross profit declined nearly 6  to  482 million in fourth quarter fiscal 2019 while gross margin contracted 500 basis points  bps  to 64 8   Further  gross margin contracted 260 bps in fiscal 2019  of which decline of 160 bps was due to tariffs and most of the remaining was attributed to higher input costs  including agave and wood Moreover  the company expects gross margin for fiscal 2020 to be impacted by the persistence of tariffs and higher input cost related headwinds  This is likely to result in a 200 bps decline in gross margin in fiscal 2020  The company expects impacts of tariff related costs to persist throughout fiscal 2020 compared with seven months in fiscal 2019  Additionally  it expects higher input costs  primarily related to agave  as well as ongoing wood inflation  to be an even greater drag on the gross margin in fiscal 2020 Other Headwinds   Adverse Currency RatesIn addition to the tariff woes  Brown Forman s cross border presence exposes it to negative impacts of adverse currency rates due to the appreciation of the U S  dollar against most of the major currencies  Notably  the company sells products in over 170 countries worldwide  In fiscal 2019  unfavorable currency rates impacted net sales by nearly 2 percentage points and operating income by 3 points  Moreover  we expect these headwinds to continue in fiscal 2020 Wrapping UpFrom the above picture  it is clear that increased tariffs are likely to be a major headwind for Brown Forman in the near future  Nevertheless  the company s strong brand portfolio  with multitude popular spirit brands like Jack Daniels  Southern  NYSE SO  Comfort and Finlandia Vodka  keeps it afloat in this distressing environment  In fact  we expect its continued focus on pricing  product innovation and expanding operations in emerging markets to boost its operational performance and strengthen market position Further  the company s positive earnings surprise in the last eight quarters brings optimism  Notably  the company is gaining from sustained sales growth in its portfolio of premium spirit brands  particularly bourbon and tequila  Additionally  international expansion for the Jack Daniel s trademark remains a major contributor to sales growth Looking ahead  the company remains confident that it will capitalize on its American Whiskey strategy while benefiting from investments in its brands  portfolio over the years  Amid tariff related woes  these positives can keep Brown Forman

Chicago  IL   March 1  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA    Deere   NYSE DE   and Exelon   NYSE EXC   
Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  
Top Analyst Reports for Comcast  Deere and Exelon
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Comcast  CMCSA   Deere  DE  and Exelon  EXC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Comcast s shares have outperformed the S P 500 in the past year  gaining  6 4  vs   2 9   The Zacks analyst thinks Comcast is benefiting from solid growth in residential high speed Internet customers  Expanding Wi Fi coverage along with innovative xFi control features is improving customer experience  The company s Xfinity Mobile is now used by more than one million customers 
Additionally  Green Book s Best Picture Oscar win bodes well for Comcast division Universal Pictures  Further  the Sky acquisition expands Comcast s international reach  Notably  the company will enter the streaming market through NBCUniversal s upcoming service 
However  the streaming market is highly competitive and significant investment is needed to gain footprint  Hence  incremental spending on content can hurt Comcast s margin expansion  Moreover  the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord cutting  Additionally  high debt level is a headwind 
Shares of Deere have increased  11 7  over the past six months  outperforming the S P 500  which has declined  3 6  over the same period  Deere s first quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings and revenues rose on a year over year basis aided by demand growth in key markets  Earnings missed expectations while revenues beat the same 
For fiscal 2019  Deere projects net sales growth of 7  year over year and net income of  3 6 billion  The Zacks analyst thinks the company will benefit from improving construction markets and growing replacement demand for agricultural equipment  The acquisition of Wirtgen  which enhances Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  will be a catalyst  Introduction of advanced technologies in its products will fuel growth 
Raw material cost inflation  elevated expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impact will hurt margins in the near term  Nevertheless  Deere remains well poised for long term growth backed by population and urbanization growth 
Exelon s shares have gained  30 4  in the past year  outperforming the S P 500 which has gained  2 9  over the same period  Although Exelon s earnings per share during the fourth quarter were in line with estimates  the bottom line improved from the year ago level  The improvement was due to new rates at PHI and higher energy efficiency earnings at ComEd 
The Zacks analyst thinks Exelon is likely to benefit from its  23 billion planned capital investment  focus on zero emission electricity generation and cost savings  The company continues with its hedging program to manage market risks and protect the value of its generation  Strong cash flow generation capacity will help it lower debt levels and increase value of its shareholders 
However  Exelon is subject to the impact of commodity price volatility and price fluctuation in the wholesale markets  Stringent government regulation is also a cause of concern 
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Monster Beverage  NASDAQ MNST  and Newmont  NEM

extent During these two days  three major stock indexes   the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   declined 1   1 1  and 1 6   respectively  At this juncture  it would be prudent to pick up defensive

146836,368352,MNST,Monster Beverage  MNST  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Monster Beverage  MNST  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy drink maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 3  
Revenues are expected to be  895 81 million  up 10 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 46  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Monster Beverage 
For Monster Beverage  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Monster Beverage will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Monster Beverage would post earnings of  0 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 50  delivering a surprise of  8 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Monster Beverage doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/monster-beverage-mnst-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200390204,200390204

The extended deal includes provisions for the sale of beer brands from both Heineken and Grupo Modelo in Mexico beginning April 2019  with a gradual expansion thereafter  Starting 2019  OXXO stores will simultaneously sell both brand portfolios in Mexico s biggest cities including Mexico City and Guadalajara  This will be extended to stores nationwide by 2022 Here it is imperative to mention that these deals will not only enhance the productivity of the beer category  but also add value to the Mexican beer industry  This will also boost the value proposition of OXXO stores  which contributes nearly 35  to FEMSA s revenues A glance at FEMSA s price performance shows this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock has lost 8 1  in the past six months  wider than the S P 500 index s 3 6  decline FEMSA  which belongs to  industry  has been witnessing higher operating expenses on gradual shift of store teams to employee based  higher transportation costs  higher electricity tariffs and organic growth of OXXO s international operations  Higher tariff on steel and aluminium leading to higher input costs  particularly packaging  is an added concern

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Monster Beverage  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Monster Beverage currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 31   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 27  2019

FavorTyson Foods should keep gaining from rising demand for protein packed food  which has been boosting sales volumes in the Chicken and Beef segments  Notably  the company divested the non protein businesses  such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery  Kettle and Van s  to focus more on the growing protein packed food arena  Moreover  for fiscal 2019  the USDA expects overall domestic protein production  chicken  beef  pork and turkey  to rise year over year which also gives us positive signals for the impending quarter Apart from this  the company has been steadily expanding its fresh prepared foods offering to cater to consumers  rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without any added hormones or antibiotics Also  Tyson Foods has long been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen its portfolio  which remains a tailwind to the company s revenue  The company has completed the buyout of the Keystone Foods business  which supplies a broad array of meat and chicken products across the globe  The move is likely to bolster  international presence  with improved sales as well as distribution network in growth markets  Earlier  Tyson Foods acquired AdvancePierre  Original Philly

operating income in the Beef  Chicken  Pork and Prepared Foods segments for a while  Notably  these headwinds along with narrowed earnings projection for fiscal 2019 remain a threat to the company s

Factors at PlayAvon has been witnessing soft Representatives growth over the past few quarters now  In third quarter 2018  the Active and Ending Representatives fell 5  and 6   respectively  with decline in both the Representatives across each of the company s segments  Although management is focused on boosting Representatives growth  increased costs toward reviving its direct selling business model are denting margins Higher cost of investments in Representatives  sales leader and field expenses along with elevated supply chain costs remain added deterrents  In the last reported quarter  the new revenue standard had a negative impact on margins  These factors might hurt margins and overall profitability in the to be reported quarter In addition  foreign currency translations continue to adversely impact Avon s performance  In the third quarter  revenues included a 10  negative impact from currency  Unfortunately  management expects the impacts from foreign currency to be similar in the fourth quarter Further  the consensus estimates for revenues for Europe  Middle East   Africa  South Latin America  North Latin America and Asia Pacific segments  stand at  580 million   478 million   197 million and  134 million  respectively  These figures represent a respective decline of 9 7   16 9   3 9  and 3 6  for the segments on a year over year basis Nevertheless  Avon is focused on accomplishing long term financial targets for 2021 backed by the  Open Up Avon  strategy  This initiative is aimed at bringing Avon back on the growth trajectory by focusing on reviving its direct selling business  renovating the brand  enhancing e commerce and other capabilities to aid a performance driven transformation  Additionally  the company remains committed to its cost saving endeavors to drive margins  Management expects to achieve the targeted run rate savings of  350 million for 2018 Recently  the company announced plans to improve operating efficiency  slash inventory levels and reduce portfolio complexity  It plans to do so by certain restructuring efforts  including 25  decrease in Stock Keeping Units  15  reduction in inventory levels and 10  job cuts Avon has also been making significant improvements in servicing the Representatives by improving delivery and services at its distribution centers  While these growth initiatives raise optimism  soft Representatives growth and higher spending remain major concerns in the fourth quarter Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that Avon is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fourth quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  Meanwhile  stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  are best avoided  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Avon has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  4  This combination makes surprise

highest gain in January since 2001  COBE VIX   market s fear gauge declined to its four month low at 15 57 However  volatility seems to have made a comeback in Wall Street if the last two trading days are taken into account  Concerns over slowing global growth have contributed significantly toward this trend  This has dented investors  confidence to some extent During these two days  three major stock indexes   the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   declined 1   1 1  and 1 6   respectively  At this juncture  it would be prudent to pick up defensive stocks with favorable Zacks Rank to cushion

three months Our PicksAt this juncture  investing in defensive sectors such as utilities  telecom and consumer staple will be fruitful  Defensive stocks are generally immune to vagaries of the

146907,368423,MNST,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Buy In Bearish Markets,opinion,In the current bearish markets  investors often try to undertake complex investment strategies to generate solid returns  But this may not yield desired results all the time  So  using conventional strategies  based on key fundamentals to select stocks  is a safe and sound approach for making profits One such strategy is sales growth  Often overlooked by investors in favor of earnings  steady sales growth is vital for survival of business  While earnings are vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and inflated  there are very less chances of inflating sales numbers The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth  Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without impressive sales growth  bottom line improvement will not be sustainable over the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires strong sales growth Nonetheless  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits Hence  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening     Synopsys  Inc    NASDAQ SNPS   provides electronic design automation software products used to design

146930,368446,MNST,Calls In Demand As Monster Beverage Tests Chart Support,opinion,"Monster Beverage Corp  NASDAQ MNST  has sold off in the session immediately after the company s last two quarterly reports  falling 7 5  in May and 14 4  in March  The company is set to release earnings after the close tomorrow  Aug  8    but this time expectations seem to be that the stock will gain following the quarterly update  at least going by recent options data 
Specifically  Trade Alert highlighted heavy volume at the weekly 8 10 60 50 strike call in yesterday s trading  where what appeared to be buy to open activity took place  This would mean speculators expect Monster Beverage shares    currently trading at  59 50    to rally above  60 50 by the close on Friday  when the contracts expire 
Overall  the equity has a 10 day call put volume ratio of 6 16 at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   which ranks in the 84th annual percentile  confirming a very unusual call bias in recent sessions  Taking a broader view  the September 60 call is home to peak open interest  where data points to heavy buy to open activity

146931,368447,MNST,Can Keurig Dr Pepper  KDP  Deliver Earnings Beat In Q3 ,opinion,"Keurig Dr Pepper Inc    NYSE KDP    the newly formed company after the merger of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc and Keurig Green Mountain  is slated to report its third quarter 2018 results on Nov 7  2018  This will be the first quarterly results of the combined company  which merged on Jul 9  The merged company is the seventh largest company in the U S  food and beverage sector  and the third largest beverage company in North America Keurig Dr Pepper  Inc Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors at PlayKeurig Dr Pepper is poised to gain from DPS  distribution strategy and solid innovation alongside Keurig s coffee brands and online presence  It has an edge over competitors  providing hot and cold beverages that satisfy the needs of consumers  anytime and anywhere  at home or on the go  at work or at play  It has a portfolio of more than 125 owned  licensed  partner and allied brands  with leadership in numerous beverage categories Keurig Dr Pepper is on track with the integration of the combined company  During second quarter results  it reiterated the combined company outlook for 2018 and the longer term  which it provided on Mar 20  2018  on its Investor Day  For 2018  it anticipates adjusted earnings per share of  1 02  1 07  after the impact of preliminary Purchase Price Accounting adjustments  Further  the company expects sales to grow 1 2  in 2018 For the long term  the company expects to generate deal synergies of nearly  600 million between 2019 and 2021  with about  200 million savings anticipated every year  These synergies  combined with strong margin expansion at Keurig Green Mountain and growth at historic levels for DPS  are likely to result in the combined company EPS growth rate of 15 17  between now and 2021  Additionally  Keurig Dr Pepper expects a significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging  targeting a leverage ratio of less than 3 0 in two to three years Consequently  the company s shares rallied 10 4  in the last three months against the  s decline of 8 8  
 
However  we believe that the CSD category headwinds will continue to impact the company s volumes  including the diet versions  due to Dr Pepper s strong portfolio of carbonated beverages  Cross category competition  and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth  Moreover  new taxes on sugar sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales  These general constraints in the soft drinks business are likely to continue impacting the newly formed company Further  higher aluminum prices due to the ongoing trade war are likely to increase the cost of producing cans  This  along with escalating freight costs  should result in increased prices for sodas  which may hurt profitability What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not show that Keurig Dr Pepper is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Keurig Dr Pepper s Earnings ESP of 0 00  and Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  make surprise prediction inconclusive Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat Turning Point Brands  Inc    NYSE TPB   has an Earnings ESP of  8 74  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Nu Skin Enterprises  Inc    NYSE NUS   has an Earnings ESP of  0 21  and a Zacks Rank of 3 Monster Beverage Corporation   NASDAQ MNST   has an Earnings ESP of  3 01  and a Zacks Rank  3 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-11-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-keurig-dr-pepper-kdp-deliver-earnings-beat-in-q3-200354012,200354012

Monster Beverage shares have lost about 13 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 1  
What s Next for Monster Beverage 
While Monster Beverage has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Monster Beverage was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

147023,368539,MNST,Pilgrim s Pride  PPC  Q4 Earnings  What s In The Offing  ,opinion,"Pilgrim s Pride Corporation   NASDAQ PPC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 14  after the market closes 
The company pulled of positive average earnings surprise of 1 53  for the last four quarters  Notably  in third quarter 2017 Pilgrim s Pride s adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 27 27  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Play 
We fear that lingering headwinds might prove fatal for Pilgrim s Pride s performance in fourth quarter 2017 
The company s profitability in the upcoming quarter remains sensitive to market price as well as availability of certain products such as soybean meal  corn and sorghum  These items are used by the company as intermediate inputs in some of its offerings  Any sudden supply demand imbalance or fluctuations in price of these materials might significantly raise the company s operational expenses  in turn  weighing on the company s bottom line in the quarters ahead 
The company also offers services in a highly competitive industry  Intense competition might lower aggregate market share and hence weigh over the company s revenues and profitability going forward 
Also  sudden outbreak of a livestock disease or unfavorable government trading policies might hurt results going forward  
Moreover  the United States Department of Agriculture s forecast regarding rise in global corn stocks indicates a probable decline in Pilgrim s Pride s aggregate corn exports in fourth quarter 2017 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results  Per the model  a stock needs to have a combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for a likely earnings beat Pilgrim s Pride Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
 

   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as we will see below 
Zacks ESP  Pilgrim s Pride currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 77   This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents  stands above the Most Accurate Estimate of 51 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  Pilgrim s Pride s unfavorable Zacks Rank  4  Sell   when combined with a negative Earnings ESP  makes surprise predictions difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

Here are some stocks that you may want to consider from the   as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat

147062,368578,MNST,Record  10 Trillion Paper Gold Trading Market Continues To Depress Price,opinion,"How do you depress the physical gold price  It s quite easy  you throw  10 trillion paper dollars at it  Not only did global paper gold trading amount reach a new record in 2016  it surpassed the previous year s total by nearly 50  
This is simply amazing when we look around at the staggering amount of insanity taking place in the financial markets  With the economic and financial markets sitting at the edge of the cliff  it would seem prudent for investors to curtail their highly leverage bets in the  Paper Gold Casino  and buckle down by purchasing real physical metal 
Unfortunately  the Mainstream media and the Financial networks have totally lobotomized investors by removing the following vocabulary from the mushy substance between their ears    Wisdom  Prudent  Long term  Safe haven and Gold Silver 
With the advent of twitter  wisdom today comes down to reading no more than ONE SENTENCE  Anything longer than that is a complete waste of time when it is better spent sitting in front of six computer monitors trading digits  Forget about investing one s money to build up a real company  when it is more stimulating to try and SCALP tiny profits by trading stocks all day fueled by a half dozen monster energy drinks 
This is called progress   a giant leap forward for mankind and technology 
Global Gold Exchange Notional Trading Amount Hit New  10 Trillion Record In 2016
According to GFMS newly released 2017 Gold Survey  total global exchange notional trading amount reached  9 8 trillion in 2016  This was up 46  from  6 7 trillion in 2015  These figures were based on the total amount of  volume in nominal tonne equivalent  traded on nine exchanges  For example  here are the top four exchanges annual gold traded quoted by GFMS 
COMEX   179 047 tonnes
SHFE   34 760 tonnes
SGE   11 793 tonnes
TOCOM   8 541 tonnes
The total amount of paper gold traded on the nine exchanges in 2016 equaled 243 000 metric tons versus 180 000 metric tons the previous year  I took these values and multiplied them by the average annual gold price to arrive at the figures below  I also compared these figures to the total amount of physical gold retail investment for each year  source GFMS 2017 Gold Survey  

As we can see  the global exchanges traded a stunning  9 8 trillion worth of paper gold last year versus  42 billion in physical gold investment  This turns out to be 233 times the amount of paper gold traded for each ounce of physical gold purchased  
With this sort of trading volume  the Monster Beverage 1990 Corp  NASDAQ MNST  looks like an excellent investment opportunity  And why shouldn t it be  The Monster Energy Drink stock price has surged nearly 10 times from  5 in 2009 to  46 currently  While this may seem like a good stock to invest in  I am waiting until they sell Monster Energy IV s that you just stick in your arm so you can continue trading without wasting waste time knocking down 5 6 individual cans 
We must remember  TIME IS MONEY 
So  the question is this   what would happen to the physical gold market if a small percentage of the Monster Energy Drink traders purchased physical gold instead of the millions of contracts traded on the exchanges  According to GFMS  total gold trading volume just on the COMEX last year was a stunning 58 million contracts  
Annual Global Gold Exchange Trading Volume Also Reached New Record Of 7 8 Billion Oz
Furthermore  if we look at the total amount of paper gold traded on the nine exchanges in 2016  it also reached a new record 7 8 billion oz 

Not only was the 2016 total 7 8 billion oz paper gold trading volume 34  higher than in 2015  it was 76 times higher than the 103 million oz of world gold mine supply  I decided to add the paper gold trading volume during the 1970 s when the gold futures markets began  During the first year of gold futures trading in 1975  a total of 84 million oz  Moz  were traded  However  by the end of the decade and as the gold price shot up towards  850  total paper gold trading surpassed one billion oz in 1979 
Again  what would have been the reaction to the physical gold market if investors purchased more physical gold in 1979  than the one billion ounces of paper contracts   Well  I will tell you what I think from some wisdom from Jim Rickards  I listened to Jim Rickards interview with Greg Hunter today and he had some very interesting things to say  One of Rickards interesting tidbits was that Americans own about one ounce of gold each versus the typical poor Indian farmer who has acquired kilos of gold ",2017-04-03,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/record-$10-trillion-paper-gold-trading-market-continues-to-depress-price-200180965,200180965
147063,368579,MNST,Here s Why Monster Has Little Upside Going Into Earnings,opinion,"Q1 17 Earnings Preview
  NasdaqGS NASDAQ MNST  is expected to report Q1 17 earnings on Thursday after the market closes  Over the prior eight quarters  the company s financial performance and stock price has fluctuated considerably 
For example  the company reported revenue growth of 4 1   vs  8 1  expected  for Q3 16 on November 3rd and the stock fell 14   Then the following quarter  Monster announced that sales increased 18 8   vs  11 9  expected  and shares jumped nearly 13  as highlighted below 
So what should investors expect for Q1 17 
Although the energy drink distributor has beaten its revenue estimates five out of the last eight quarters  year over year revenue growth has ranged anywhere from 0 9  to 19 3   As a result  the stock has traded at a low of  36 00 per share and a high  54 00 per share over the same period  Overall  the market seems to be trying to figure out if this is still the high growth company that investors have witnessed over the last decade 
However  industry headwinds  poor peer group performance and product delays point to a troubling quarter ahead 
Industry Headwinds   Overvalued Peers
 on April 19th that U S  soda sales  including energy drinks  dropped for the 12th consecutive year in the face of consumers choosing healthier options and a slew of sugar taxes  While a declining soft drink market and new tax levies have not directly disrupted Monster s ability to grow its top line in recent years  it is a long term negative that will surely impact the company down the road 
In addition  comparable companies in the beverage industry appear to be struggling as seen from their recent Q1 17 earnings   NYSE DPS  shares have dropped nearly 6  since the company announced that it missed its revenue estimate by  on April 26th  On the same day    NYSE PEP  reported that its top line beat estimates by  and the stock has since fallen almost 2  
  NYSE KO  also beat its revenue expectations by  but total sales actually fell 11   its eighth consecutive quarterly decline  The stock has generally remained flat since its earnings announcement 
Dr  Pepper Snapple missed its revenue estimate and the stock has fallen 6   Pepsi beat its estimate and shares still dropped 2   Coca Cola crushed its estimate and the stock has remained flat implying that these beverage companies had stretched valuations going into earnings 
The chart below compares each company s  and projected five year  to Monster s Monster is expected to grow at a faster rate over the next five years compared to the selected peer group but not materially higher  Wall Street expects Dr  Pepper and Pepsi to grow their EBITDA at over 7 0  annually compared to Monster s 10 0   However  Monster s 18 4x forward EBITDA multiple is significantly higher than Dr  Pepper s  11 6x  and Pepsi s  13 7x  
Furthermore  shares of Monster appear 25  overvalued when applying Wall Street estimates to nine separate finbox io cash flow analyses as shown below  
So what should investors expect when Monster reports on Thursday 
Concluding Remarks  Little Upside Before Earnings
Wall Street analysts expect revenues to reach  740 million  8 8  growth  in Q1 17 which is a reachable figure based on the company s historical performance  However  investors should not expect big upside potential based on the recent earnings performance of industry peers 
In addition  the company s recent  has caused a delay in the launch of the new replenishing drink by potentially 90 days  Expect an update from management on Thursday and whether it is expected to have any impact on the company s performance for the remainder of the year  Any cut in full year guidance will likely weigh heavily on shares 
Overall  Monster s stock appears overvalued on a relative and long term cash flow basis  Value investors may want to stay away prior to Thursday s earnings announcement ",2017-05-01,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-why-monster-has-little-upside-going-into-earnings-200186414,200186414
147079,368595,MNST,Bear Of The Day  Monster Beverage  MNST ,opinion,"Monster Beverage  NASDAQ MNST  reported Q3 earnings on November 3 and missed the top and bottom line consensus estimates  Shares are off over 12  since then  with over 18 million changing hands on November 4 as some institutions decided it was clearly time to exit the stock 

And now  many other investors are wondering if this is a buying opportunity just another 10  from 52 week lows  or if there is something more to be concerned about  

Earnings and revenues did improve 4 1  and 17 9  year over year  respectively  driven largely by impressive gross margins   courtesy of cost of goods savings  the AFF transaction and product mix 

But the results failed to impress in every other aspect  Operating expenses rose over 22   leading to roughly flat operating income growth  The U S  market was softer than international figures with only 1 9  net sales growth 

And results were also hurt by weaker foreign currencies and purchases by retailers ahead of a price hike  However  although net sales growth of 4 1  was weaker than 14  recorded in the first half of the year  Monster Beverage s sales bounced back in October  rising 12   including 10  growth in the key U S  market 

Given this mixed picture  analysts leaned on the side of bringing estimates down  and that s what brought the stock down to a Zacks  5 Rank  Strong Sell  

Full year 2016 EPS estimates were taken down from  1 30 to  1 24 while 2017 profit projections were clipped from  1 60 to  1 53 

Third Quarter Details

Monster Beverage s third quarter diluted earnings of 33 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 37 by 10 8   Meanwhile  earnings increased 17 9  year over year on lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016 

Net sales of  787 95 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  817 20 million by 3 6   However  the figure improved 4 1  year over year 

Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of  2 6 million on net sales  Net sales outside the U S  rose 11 8  to  190 8 million on a year over year basis 

The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33 8    compared with 39 4  a year ago  The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a one time tax benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction 

As a result of the AFF transaction  the company achieved raw material cost savings of  23 3 million in the third quarter 

Segment Details

Monster Energy Drinks Segment  The segment reported net sales of  710 1 million  up 3 4  year over year 

Strategic Brands segment  This segment includes brands acquired from Coca Cola  Net sales at the segment increased 3 2  to  72 1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with  69 9 million in the comparable quarter of 2015 

Other  Net sales for the company s Other segment  which includes certain products of American Fruits   Flavors sold to independent third parties  were  5 7 million in the quarter under review  Notably  the segment had reported no net sales in the prior year quarter 

Bottom line for Monster  Stocks follow earnings estimates and right now the new trend is down for MNST  Until this changes  it s best to stay on the sidelines  The Zacks Rank will let you know

USGS Just Discovered the Biggest Shale Oil Field in America

On Tuesday  the U S  Geological Survey  USGS   that it has discovered the biggest deposit of untapped oil in the United States  located in the Wolfcamp shale formation in the Midland Basin portion of Texas  Permian Basin 

Wolfcamp has an estimated average of 20 billion barrels of oil  16 trillion cubic feet of associated natural gas  and 1 6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids there for the taking  To put this into perspective  according to USGS  the Prudhoe Bay formation on the North Slope of Alaska the largest producing oil field in North America to date has only produced roughly 12 billion barrels of oil in the past 43 years  And the East Texas Field  which is the biggest producing oil field in the lower 48 states  has produced just over 7 billion barrels of oil since the 1930s 

In other words  the magnitude of this oil discovery is incredible  And based on current oil prices  the newly found untapped oil is worth almost  900 billion 

 The fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that  even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil  there is still the potential to find billions more   said Walter Guidroz  program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program 

 Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable  and that s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world   Guidroz continues 

USGS notes that over 3 000 horizontal oil wells have already been drilled and finished in the Wolfcamp section of the Midland Basin  According to   Wolfcamp has been one of the primary targets for shale drillers like ConocoPhillips  NYSE      and Diamondback Energy Inc   NASDAQ        in recent years  as intensive drilling and fracturing techniques  or fracking  became more commonly used

MNST Technical Analysis

MNST opened trading yesterday at  41 41 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  41 44  Shares closed trading yesterday at  42 01 and spiked up after market to  47 91  equivalent to a 14  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see that the last time MNST traded above these levels we have to go all the way back to November 2nd 2016  when it traded at highs of  48 10 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up MNST had been in an overall downward trend dating back to January 5th  when it traded at  46 19  MNST has a float of 424 64 million  and traded 1 57 times the normal daily trading volume on Wednesday 
For  purposes  I would like to see MNST open trading on Thursday above  46 00 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My stop loss would be  0 35 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

147127,368643,MNST,Why Shares Of Monster Beverage Corp   MNST  Are Down Today ,opinion,"Shares of Monster Beverage Corporation   NASDAQ MNST   fell Monday after analysts at Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   downgraded the stock to  market perform  from  outperform   The downgrade stemmed from expectations of weak second revenue growth  as well as a delayed release of the company Mutant and Hydro drinks in the fourth quarter 
In an analyst note  Wells Fargo said it still had  a favorable outlook in the long term   but added  over the short term we have concerns given soft results in Q2 and delays in launching new innovation   The company s partnership with Coca Cola  KO  last year has helped to expand its reach in the U S  and internationally  Still though  Monster s growth may be stunted outside the U S  by macroeconomic challenges  a few territorial disputes with Coca Cola  and a disappointing introduction in China  the firm also noted 
MNST was down more than 3 5  in late afternoon trading  The company has been a consistently solid performer over in the last year or so  but the downgrade from WFC hit the stock hard  If it is able to report better than expected sales and earnings numbers  the stock could see a jump higher  Its next earnings report though isn t scheduled until August  so investors will have to wait to see those results

Europe and Asia mostly higher to close out the week
European equities finished higher for a second straight session  posting a second week of gains  on the heels of the favorable U S  economic data  headlined by a stronger than expected 4Q GDP report  Commodity related issues led the way  bolstered by extended gains for oil and lingering hopes of further global central bank stimulus measures  With the G 20 meeting of world leaders set to get under way  China s central bank leader hinted at further actions  while cooler than expected French and German inflation reports likely buoyed expectations that the European Central Bank will announce further measures following next month s meeting  Meanwhile  uncertainty regarding the exit of the U K  from the European Union  EU  remained  with the British pound lower versus the U S  dollar after dropping sharply early in the week  The euro was lower versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region finished mixed  In economic news  French 4Q GDP growth was revised higher to a 0 3  quarter over quarter pace  versus expectations of an unrevised gain of 0 2   matching the growth seen in 3Q 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly to the upside following the advances in the U S  and Europe yesterday  bolstered by gains in crude oil prices  Japanese stocks posted their first back to back weekly gain since November  per Bloomberg  despite a flat read on consumer price inflation and as the yen overcame early losses late in the session  The yen was relatively stable for the week  after rallying recently on concerns about the decision by the Bank of Japan  BoJ  to adopt a negative interest rate policy  NIRP  
Mainland Chinese equities rebounded from yesterday s tumble on a flare up in liquidity concerns  which added to festering growth worries for the world s second largest economy that have been exacerbated by the recent weakness in the yuan  Stocks trading in Hong Kong also rebounded from Thursday s drop  aided by comments from the People s Bank of China  PBoC  Governor who noted while world finance chiefs and central bankers gathered in Shanghai for the G 20 meeting that China still has some  monetary policy space  and  multiple policy instruments to address possible downside risks   per Bloomberg 
Australian equities finished flat amid some weakness in resource related issues  South Korean securities ticked higher  and Indian stocks rose  recovering some of the week s losses that have stemmed from caution ahead of next week s key federal budget release 
Stocks go back to back
U S  stocks closed higher for the second straight week  Global risk aversion relatively waned  with the Japanese yen trimming its recent rally and U S  Treasury yields moving higher after being pressured as of late by the heightened global market volatility and Fed rate hike uncertainty  Stocks showed some resiliency in the face of elevated uncertainty regarding the possibility that the U K  could leave the EU  U S  data helped foster some of positive sentiment  with Friday s plethora of favorable reports being preceded by the highest annual rise in existing home sales in six months and durable goods orders jumping broadly including the largest gain for the component pertaining to business spending since June 2014  Also  4Q earnings season continued to roll on  highlighted by Dow member Home Depot Inc N HD  s  N HD  125  stronger than expected results and guidance  Of the 482 companies in the S P 500 that have reported thus far  nearly 75  have bested earnings forecasts  while only about 46  have topped sales estimates  per data compiled by Bloomberg 
Heavy dose of data awaits the markets
The February nonfarm payroll report to end next week will likely garner the most attention  but the data point that has the potential to carry the most weight of the robust U S  economic calendar is Thursday s ISM non Manufacturing Index  The report is a measure of business activity in the more heavily weighted domestic services sector and will follow Wednesday s ISM Manufacturing Index  Although the U S  economy remains bifurcated manufacturing is in recession  but services are hanging in there talk of recession got louder after the latest reading from the Institute of Supply Management on services came in weaker than expected  Overall  the leading economic indicators have not rolled over to the extent typically seen before recessions 
Other U S  reports slated for next week include  Chicago PMI Index  Markit s business activity reports  the Fed s Beige Book  factory orders  and the trade balance 
Internationally next week  Australia Reserve Bank of Australia s monetary policy decision  building approvals  4Q GDP  trade balance  and retail sales  China Manufacturing and non Manufacturing PMI reports  India Fiscal budget  Japan industrial production  retail sales  and household spending  Eurozone CPI  unemployment rate  and Markit s business activity reports  along with German retail sales and unemployment change  U K  Markit s business activity reports

CommentaryAnother Fed inspired pop is long forgotten again 
T2108 closed at 31 7   a level last seen in mid August  The 2 day loss of 24 9  qualifies for quasi oversold conditions  The T2108 Trading Model  TTM  estimates 70  odds of further downside to follow Monday s selling  The classification error is a very high 46   10x cross validation   the error rate when fit just to history is about 30   The lesson from the last quasi oversold episode is to operate as though the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   will close down but to recognize that the market is stretched and a simple positive catalyst could send it lurching higher  For example  the TTM cannot anticipate the catalyst we saw last week  a journalist talking Happy Fed talk that the market uses as an excuse for buying  T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their 200DMA further underlines the quasi oversold condition  T2107 has quickly plunged to 51 3   a level last seen in February 

T2108 plunges to oversold conditions

T2107 is now at a level where a bounce could happen at any time
I do not have a formal model for interpreting extremes in T2107  Since the August lows occurred at similar T2107 levels  traders should stay on alert that the market could bounce sharply at ANY time  For a mental model  think about the psychology of buyers and folks eager to participate in the market  They are looking at their favorite stocks falling very fast to or through key price and other technical levels  In many cases  they missed buying the last time their favorite trades reached this level  Punches through the 200DMA can look particularly over extended to folks looking for a buying excuse  So  when an influential voice flips the right switch  the party gets started 
For the rest of us  we need to stay calm and remain VERY circumspect  A bearish chill is still descending upon the market in my opinion  I have a HOLD for the trading call only because no key technical level has broken to justify telling longs to stop out and or lock profits  I also see a few pullbacks that indeed look worth the risk to justify a quick trade  Make no mistake though  but the S P 500  SPY  and the NASDAQ  via PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   are still looking toppy 
The S P 500 printed a fresh all time high after the Federal Reserve announced its latest monetary policy decision  It was yet another  that the main media insisted on turning into a moment of financial drama  This print may turn into a false breakout given it was followed by a moment of indecision  a candlestick doji called an evening star  Monday s selling confirmed the bearish interpretation of this potential sign of the end of the uptrend and thus a topping pattern 

The S P 500 descends sharply off an ominous topping doji called an  evening star 
Regular readers should also notice that Friday created a kind of divergence given T2108 definitively declined even as the S P 500 remained flat  It was another divergence that signaled a big move the next day 
The NASDAQ  QQQ  is still in worse shape than the S P 500  The NASDAQ not only failed to make a new high last week  but also it is STILL struggling to invalidate the bearish engulfing topping pattern from September 3rd 

The NASDAQ is STILL struggling with the ominous bearish engulfing  topping  pattern
The volatility index  the VIX  naturally jumped on yesterday s selling  It just happened to gap up from a retest of August s lows  This move once again verifies that the ever so slight bias of volatility is now going to increase NOT decrease  are central banks across the planet starting to breathe sighs of relief    
Finally  as you can imagine  the swift trading has created some very important and even enticing stock chart patterns  I do not have the time to post these charts  so I will trust interested readers to look these up on your own  Some of the stocks in this list are also follow ups to trades I have proposed in previous posts 
iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  ARCA EEM   gap down of  1 5  confirmed 50DMA breakdown  Sold latest round of puts  I will continue to fade EEM rallies at key points of resistance 
iShares MSCI Turkey  ARCA TUR   Broke its 200DMA on Friday  With the Turkish lira  USD TRY  losing out to the U S  dollar  I moved quickly to buy puts on TUR  I may get more aggressive on USD TRY longs 
SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY   Confirmed breakdown of 200DMA and a topping pattern which  on September 15  A complete reversal of the June 17 surge is now in play  I locked in profits and sold my put options  This one is good to fade on rallies to resistance 
Zillow  NASDAQ Z   I screwed up last week trying to hold on for more profits from the decline and ended up empty handed  I should have just shorted the stock instead of buying puts  Shares are hard to borrow though  I bought a small number of shares as a play on Z s tendency to surge for no apparent reason immediately following active selling 
Rio Tinto plc  NYSE RIO   Gapped down and confirmed bearish developments I wrote about earlier  See  for a follow up  I am holding onto my January puts as I anticipate a LOT more selling in the coming weeks or months 
Monster Beverage Corporation  NASDAQ MNST   My timing was off and I had to sell my call options at a loss last week  I somehow neglected to make sure a fresh order on Friday executed  Sure enough  an upgrade on Monday sent the stock up 2 9  on a bout of impressive relative strength and a new 1 month high  As a good friend noted  the current plunge in commodity prices will help beverage companies like MNST 
Caterpillar Inc   NYSE CAT   I sold my puts last week for a nice profit but wish I had bought longer dated put options  On Monday  CAT fell another 1 6  to stop just short of hitting its 200DMA  my downside bearish target  A break of this level will sound the bearish alarm bells VERY loudly  I like continuing to fade CAT on bounces 
Rackspace Hosting  Inc   NYSE RAX   I was VERY fortunate to have a stop in place for my previous tranche of call options  I was taken out when RAX punched below  38 briefly  I was not happy until last Wednesday s fresh collapse on news that RAX had given up looking for a buyer  I moved into fresh  long dated call options  This is pure speculation now because a catalyst to regain lost ground is much less clear now  A market sell off will undoubtedly take RAX even lower 
Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   This trade was my best one of last week  BIDU popped on cue after a 50DMA retest  I sold out a little early  but I was nonetheless happy  I was VERY tempted to dive right back in on Monday s retest of the 50DMA on a 4 5  plunge  I decided to be a bit more patient this time since one could easily argue BIDU is starting to look like it is making a triple top  Gulp 
I think readers can tell from my trades which stock market beast currently has the strongest grip on my heart and mind even as I reserve some mettle for very select bullish plays

147200,368716,MNST,Monster Beverage  Monster Stock ,opinion,Monster Beverage Corporation  NASDAQ  MNST   previously called Hansen Natural Corporation  develops  markets  sells  and distributes alternative beverage category beverages in the United States and across the world  The company s Monster Energy brand  after which the company is named  is its flagship product line and accounts for approximately 91 percent of total sales  Monster Beverage s stock has been soaring recently  it is up 58 7  YTD and 100 9  from a year ago  With the company s stock on such a tear  many worry that Monster Beverage has run its course and is starting to lose steam  Although this is a valid fear  there are several factors working in Monster Beverage s favor that could ultimately ensure the continued strength of the company     The Positives   Monster Beverage s Monster Energy drinks continue to sell extremely well  buoyed by strong demand  In fact  as chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks  in the company s 2012 1Q financial results  the  energy drink category in general  and the Monster Energy  brand in particular  have continued their positive growth trends   According to Gary Hemphill  senior vice president of the Beverage Marketing Corp   on a wholesale basis  energy drink sales climbed 45 percent to  4 37 billion from 2006 to 2010  In order to fully capitalize on this demand  Monster Beverage has expanded the Monster Energy product line  recently adding a fifth product to the Monster Rehab  line  This expansion allows for diversification of the products  thus allowing it to appeal to a larger segment of consumers  It should also be noted that Monster Beverage has also increased its unit profit per case of energy drink sold to  2 84  This combination of sustained growth in demand as well as profitability should prove to be a winning formula for Monster Beverage in the future   Monster Beverage is also aggressively expanding into foreign markets and stands to benefit from establishing itself with large segments of untapped international consumers  Retail sales of Monster Energy  started in Hong Kong and Macau during April and in Japan and Ecuador in early May  International sales have been positive  with gross sales to customers outside the United States increasing to  100 6 million in the first quarter of 2012  compared with  72 8 million in the corresponding quarter in 2011  Monster Beverage is also planning on launching products in additional countries later this year and the company s expansion strategy should have a significant positive impact on its bottom line The NegativeThe U S  has recently been abuzz over Mayor Michael Bloomberg s proposed ban on large sized sugary drinks at restaurants  movie theaters  and from street vendors in New York City  This new law  if passed  will prohibit the sale of sodas  pre sweetened ice teas  and sugar laced energy drinks larger than 16 ounces  Although Monster Beverages will not be directly affected by this ban since its beverages are sold in large 16 ounce cans  the objective of the ban  to get people to choose healthier beverage alternatives  may prove to be detrimental to Monster Beverage s energy drink sales in NYC  Moreover  if the law passes in New York City  it could potentially set a powerful precedent for the rest of America s cities  a development which  if effective in changing people s mindsets about beverages  could have an impact on Monster Beverage s bottom line The ResultsMonster Beverage is in solid financial shape and has consistently posted double digit earnings and sales growth  For the first quarter of 2012  Monster Beverage reported an EPS increase of 41  YOY  raising the average EPS growth of the last three quarters to 32   For the current quarter  estimates are up and Monster Beverage is expected to post an EPS increase of 33  YOY  From a broader time range  we can see that Monster s 3 Year EPS growth stands at 36   Monster Beverage has experienced 3 consecutive years of Annual EPS Growth and is expected to post a 2012 annual EPS increase of 33 33   In terms of sales  sales increased 28  YOY in the first quarter of 2012  Monster s 3 Year Sales Growth  meanwhile  stands at 20   It should also be noted that Monster Beverage has strong profitability  The company s Annual Pre Tax Margin is 26 8   while its Annual ROE stands at 31 7   Moreover  Monster Beverage has the highest operating margins in the industry and no debt The VerdictMonster Beverage s strong earnings and financial performance have made it a hit with mutual funds  The stock has experienced 6 consecutive quarters of increasing fund ownership and saw a 3  increase in mutual fund ownership in its first quarter of 2012  Monster Beverage  overall  has significant factors  such as the continued strength in energy drink demand and its internationalization strategy  that provide the stock with significant upside potential ,2012-06-05,George
