195387,416903,FLEX,Flex says China jobs impacted after Huawei row,news,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG  Reuters    Flex Ltd  O FLEX   a contract manufacturer for Huawei that is locked in a dispute with the Chinese tech giant over about  100 million worth of assets  said the market situation was affecting some of its jobs in the Asian nation 
Chinese financial magazine Caixin reported late on Sunday that some 10 000 Flex jobs in China were expected to be cut as two major factories in Changsha and Zhuhai had stopped work due to its row with Huawei 
While declining to comment on the report  a Flex spokesman said  after careful review of the market situation and customer need  we are offering impacted employees job opportunities within Flex Zhuhai Industrial Park and other Flex locations  
He declined to say how many employees had been affected but denied it was a layoff  A Flex source said the firm employs some 50 000 people in China  with Zhuhai being its largest base 
Huawei last month said Flex had withheld some 700 million yuan   100 million  worth of Huawei goods in its Zhuhai factory after Washington put Huawei on a trade blacklist in mid May  causing losses for the Chinese company 
At the time  Flex had said it was  actively working  with Huawei  to find a mutually agreeable way forward  after their partnership had  recently been impacted by unforeseen challenges resulting from the US China trade situation  
Dual headquartered in the United States and Singapore  Flex is among the world s largest electronics manufacturers and competes against Foxconn Technology  TW 2354  in providing manufacturing services for Huawei products such as smartphones and 5G base stations

195403,416919,FLEX,Should Value Investors Consider Flex Ltd   FLEX  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Flex Ltd    NASDAQ FLEX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Flex Ltd  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 7  While Flex Ltd  s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 12 over the past five years  it stands below the highs for the stock Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Computer   Technology sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should point out that Flex Ltd  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 6  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Flex Ltd  has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from this aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Flex Ltd  currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Flex Ltd  a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Flex Ltd  is 8 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 9 8  Clearly  FLEX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Flex Ltd  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives FLEX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat encouraging  While the current quarter estimates have not witnessed any revisions in the past thirty days  the full year estimate has seen three upward and no downward revisions in the same time frame This has had just a slightly positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the full year estimate has inched higher by 1 9  in a month  though the current quarter estimate has remained unchanged  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Flextronics International Ltd  Price and Consensus    However  this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term Bottom LineFlex Ltd  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite having a Zacks Rank  3  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 45  of more than 250 industries  which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company  Further  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All                 Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for

195404,416920,FLEX,Falling Earnings Estimates Signal Weakness Ahead For Flex Ltd   FLEX ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Flex Ltd    NASDAQ FLEX    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in FLEX A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen five estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  1 43 a share a month ago to its current level of  1 24 Also  for the current quarter  Flex has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 25 cents a share from 31 cents over the past 30 days   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 16 6  in the past month Flex Ltd  Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Electronics   Miscellaneous Products industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Hoya Corp    OTC HOCPY    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/falling-earnings-estimates-signal-weakness-ahead-for-flex-ltd-flex-200317002,200317002

Review  Are There More Unnerving Face Rippers Ahead 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Are There More Unnerving Face Rippers Ahead  We noted the market s recent tendency towards volatile daily  swings and fits  had created attractive trading opportunities  but suggested investors not lose sight of their personal goals in the market 
This Week  Are You Selling The Rips Or Buying The Dips 
In a continuation of last week s theme  the significant intraday volatility continues  and traders are taking differing viewpoints on how to play them  For perspective  the S P 500 just completed its fifth straight day where it moved at least 2  between its intraday high and intraday low 

And according to Shawn Langlois   Sell the rally  has replaced  buy the dip   For example  earlier this week Shawn wrote 

After weeks like the train wreck that just passed  investors are supposed to come along and scoop up bargains  no  That s been the norm for decades  after all  Alas  it s not the norm any more  as this Wall Street Journal chart shows 


Interestingly  Ulli Niemann also highlight this recent changing market manta noting 

Yesterday s rebound ran into resistance quickly  as traders were more comfortable adopting the mantra  let s sell the rip  rather than believing the rally had substance to it  

Building further off this changing trend  we highlighted a particularly good lesson that Dr  Brett Steenbarger has learned from famous trader  Victor Niederhoffer 

If you are part of the herd  there is no way to achieve distinctive returns  Identifying dominant market cycles within stable market periods allows the trader to know when markets are likely to exhibit momentum and when they are likely to reverse 

We ll review specific  dip buying  and  rip selling  trades later in this report  but first a look at performance 
Model Performance 
We are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested  as shown in the following table 

Worth noting  the model results look weak in various time frames  but it is actually a reflection of only the last month or so  Our system of exits is more complex  and more effective  than most simple  price based methods  Without going into the details  it is a bit more  patient  than most  For perspective  the models do well in up markets and flat markets  In large declines they outperform the general market via a complete exit  For more than a month we have been operating on the edge of the effective range   something that we report in the indicator snapshot each week on WTWA  The recent market action illustrates the effectiveness of our approach  which will start to show up in next week s table  Unlike our models  systems that use aggressive stops have difficulty in re entry  Our models are less likely to miss the subsequent rebound after the market sells off

Expert Picks From The Models 
Note  This week s Stock Exchange is edited by guest author Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Felix  This week I purchased shares of Flex Ltd  MX FLEXN 
Blue Harbinger  Why 
Felix  Because I am a trader  and I like to buy stocks with momentum  I typically hold for around 66 weeks 

BH  Momentum  Felix  That chart looks like the price has been going much lower over the last year  Perhaps you re talking about earnings momentum  As you can see in the following Fast Graph  EPS has been rising  and is expected to keep rising  even though the price has gone lower 

Felix  If you re so worried about the price going lower  perhaps it is helpful for you to know I have specific price targets in mind on my trades  and I use stops and monitor macro conditions for risk management purposes 
BH  I am a long term investor  Felix  And I care about fundamentals  For your information  from a fundamental standpoint  this stock actually looks cheap to me considering the business has been improving  For example Flex  formerly Flextronics  used to manufacture parts almost exclusively for electronics companies  but they ve been wisely diversifying into other industries in recent years  They also moved from just following customer manufacturing specifications  to actually working with some customers on design  I think this is smart too  The recent sell off  which has been significant  Felix  probably has a lot to do with fears related to the recent China spat  but that will eventually end  and even be forgotten  and these shares could easily snap back and rise much higher 
Felix  I d tell you I am happy you agree with my view on Flex  but I am a technical  non human  trading model  I have no emotions  and that is one of my advantages versus humans 
Athena  While you two are going back and forth about your investment processes  I am chiming in to let you know I have had success trading in and out of Flex recently  e g  buying the rips and selling the dips   and I am currently long the shares 
BH  Really 
Athena  Yes  I bought shares on November 27th  sold them at a slight profit on December 4th  and then purchased them back at a lower price this week on December 11th 

BH  That s a lot of trades  Athena  Has something about that business fundamentally changed in the last two weeks 
Athena  As you know  I am a technical trader  and my typical holding period is around 17 weeks  However  with all the recent volatility I have been buying the dips and selling the rips 
BH  That s your strategy  Buy low  Sell high 
Athena  As you also know  I run a  king of the mountain  type strategy  and it takes a lot to get into my  best ideas  portfolio  I am also big on momentum too 
BH  Got it  Thanks for the info  and nice trade  And how about you  Holmes any thing to share this week 
Holmes  I purchased Intelsat Sa  NYSE I  on December 6th  I am a technical model focused on specific dip buying opportunities 

BH  Holmes  Intelsat missed earning expectations by a large amount  and they announced this news at the end of October that was a big contributor to the price decline  or dip  as you call it   Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Holmes   Even though I am a technical trading model  I still know that the lower earnings was due to two large non cash earnings adjustments  Revenue was still ahead of expectations 
BH  Okay Holmes  but to play devil s advocate  aren t you afraid  dip buying  is out of style in the market right now 
Holmes  First off all  I am a technical trading model  so no I am not  afraid   and no I don t fall for popular media narratives just because they sound good  Besides  my strategy is usually implemented in combination with one of the other models to help minimize the risks of a certain strategy s style performance 
BH  Okay  thanks  And how about you  Road Runner any trades to share 
Road Runner  I purchased Zebra Technologies Corporation  NASDAQ ZBRA   the bar code company  in the lower end of a rising channel  on December 6th 

BH  Looks like the shares are up since you purchased  When will you sell 
RR  My typical holding period is 4 weeks 
BH  Well if that same pattern in your chart holds up  that trade could be a big winner  but there is a lot more going on in the market from a macro and company specific standpoint  For example  here is a look at the Fast Graph  if you feel like digging into some of the fundamental data 

RR  Great and here is a look at a long term chart if you feel like considering more of the technicals 

Conclusion 
Differing trading strategies can work better or worse depending on market conditions  For example   selling the rips  has been having more success in recent weeks than normal  as compared to  buying the dips   Recognizing changing market conditions can be helpful when deciding which trades to place  as well as how much of your trading dollars to allocate among strategies  We find that a blended approach can help keep risks lower while allowing for competitive and healthy long term returns

195428,416944,FLEX,Flextronics  A Stock That Requires Flexibility,opinion,"Flextronics  NASDAQ FLEX  has been in the cross hairs before  It was a Top 10 Pick on March 24 but never triggered  Much of the reasoning for putting it on the radar is the same as it was then  With this stock you need to be flexible  Take a look 
The daily chart above shows an ascending triangle building against upward resistance at 9 55  This was also the top in September 2013 before it started the move lower to 7 00  The Measured Move on a break over 9 55 would take it to 10 30  a good potential return  There is also an Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern with a target of 11 80 on a break of the blue neckline  Oh  and there is a Cup and Handle there as well with a target to 12 10  And the momentum indicators  RSI and MACD are supportive  In fact the RSI remains in the bullish range  while the MACD is crossing positive  With the 50 day SMA moving higher  and recently contacting the price  the picture is a bit brighter since the last time the MACD crossed up  This is not a layup trade  but for a potential 26  return after a year of resistance it may pay to be flexible enough to take it on the trigger

195429,416945,FLEX,Flextronics  Miss The Breakout  Buy The Pullback,opinion,"When I was a new trader and missed the chance to buy the breakout of a hot stock I had my eyes on  I used to get rather upset and frustrated with myself 
After all  I felt I was truly missing out on a great opportunity to profit from momentum swing trading 
But I eventually learned that buying breakouts is definitely not the only way to make money in a bull market 
The beauty of my trading system is that it allows for buying a pullback whenever strong breakouts are not bought for any reason 
When buying a pullback that follows a breakout  the profit is obviously slightly lower than if the buy entry occurred immediately on the rally above price resistance 
However  the positive trade off is that buying pullbacks is often lower risk than buying breakouts because there is a lower risk of the breakout failing 
FLEXing The Breakout Muscles
Last month  Flextronics International  NASDAQ FLEX  emerged onto our internal radar screen as a potential swing trade buy entry for subscribers of The Wagner Daily  
Here are the main reasons we liked the stock for potential breakout buy entry 
 FLEX rallied through 40 week moving average  similar to 200 day moving average  in late January and early February  then formed a tight ranged  11 week consolidation near its 52 week high  after stalling at  9 50   The push back above the 40 week moving average was also on increasing volume 
The 10 week moving average  similar to 50 day moving average  crossed up above 40 week moving average  which is a bullish trend reversal signal 
The 10 week moving average caught up and provided support as  FLEX began to build a constructive base 
On May 2  there was a  shakeout  candlestick that turned into a bullish reversal because the price closed near the intraday high  Such an intraday shakeout absorbs overhead supply by causing the  weak hands  to dump their shares at the first hint of risk  thereby clearing the way for a subsequent advance 
 FLEX broke out from the base of consolidation on higher than average volume  closing near the highs of the week 
We missed the breakout entry point in our newsletter  but there was no need to panic  rather  we simply waited for a low risk pullback entry to emerge 
Each of the technical factors above are shown on the weekly chart below 

Since the breakout from a solid base of consolidation was quite valid  I began stalking the stock for a potential pullback entry because odds favored the breakout leading to another leg higher within the developing uptrend 
Zooming into the shorter term daily chart time frame below  notice that  FLEX broke out on better than average volume  then pulled back for two days on declining volume  lighter volume on the pullback is bullish   On the second day of the pullback  the stock formed a bullish reversal candle  which is shown below 

On the chart above  notice the second day of the pullback  undercut  support of the two day low  but reversed to close near the highs of the session  and above the prior day s low   This was a bullish shakeout on lighter volume  indicating that most of the sellers are now gone 
The following day  day 3 of the pullback   volume picked up and price moved higher 
On day 4 of the pullback  the price once again dropped lower intraday  testing the prior day s low   then reversed to close near the intraday high 
After four days of tight price consolidation that followed the breakout   FLEX was now correcting more by time  consolidating  than price  retracing lower   This led to the formation of a bull flag type pattern 
On the fourth day sideways   FLEX formed an inside day  presenting our subscribers with a low risk buy entry over the five day high 
As such  I listed  FLEX in in the following day s   evening of May 30  for potential buy entry IF the price rallied above the two day high  marked by the blue horizontal line on the chart below  

As anticipated  the trade setup triggered for buy entry the next day  June 2  
After a few days of higher closes on light volume   FLEX finally followed through to the upside  on June 4   with a strong 3 2  advance on volume that was 50  greater than average  This volume spike was important  as it pointed to institutional accumulation 
The annotated chart below shows the actual buy entry point in my newsletter  as well as the two price levels at which I scaled out of the trade into strength  about one week later  

Partial share size was sold on June 10  at  11 12   while more shares were sold the following day  at  11 25  
The average sell price of those two exit points equated to a net share price gain of 8 9  with a holding period of just over a week 
Now What 
In my Wagner Daily newsletter  my model stock picking portfolio continues to hold 50  of the shares from our original June 2 buy entry 
The plan with the remaining shares into sell into strength of the next leg up  planning for an exit around the  12  13 area  
If all goes according to plan  which is obviously never guaranteed   it will equate to a 20  30  share price gain from our entry point  which is the approximate return I seek to achieve with most of my short to intermediate term momentum swing trade entries ",2014-06-18,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flextronics:-miss-the-breakout-buy-the-pullback-216584,216584
195430,416946,FLEX,Flextronics  Technical Flexibility,opinion,"I like to say that technical analysis is good at showing Point of Reflection  not Points of Inflection  By that I mean it can highlight where changes might occur in a stock price  but not where it will happen  It gives you places to look for opportunities  which you have to be flexible to spot 
Flextronics International  O FLEX  is a good example of that  For the past 16 months the stock has moved around a very tight pivot point from 11 30 to 11 50  Ten times the range has stopped the stock trend and reversed it  But twice the price moved through it like that range was not important  The chart below shows that 

As it approaches the pivot area for the 13th time  it has some real positive momentum  The RSI is making a 6 month high and rising in the bullish zone  The MACD is also rising and making a 6 month high as it  too  turns positive  And the Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside to allow it to run higher  Will it break through and head toward the previous highs  Or will it get knocked back 
Be flexible as you plan your attack ",2015-10-14,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/being-flexible-with-flextronics-268144,268144
