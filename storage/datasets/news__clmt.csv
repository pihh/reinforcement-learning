3004,224519,CLMT,Can Rising Shale Output Disrupt Oil s Rally  6 Top Picks ,opinion,On May 27  oil prices increased more than 1  boosted by geopolitical tensions and the impact of OPEC s production controls  Only last week  crude prices had suffered their worst weekly losses of the year due to trade tensions and concerns about global growth A new report from Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   states that deflationary factors will keep oil prices low in the long term  The report does acknowledge the impact of supply bottlenecks and geopolitical concerns that have cropped up this year  However  it says that rising U S  shale supplies will dampen any rise in crude prices But the report has a long list of conditions which would have to hold true if crude prices are to remain depressed even in the long term  With geopolitical tensions likely to persist  investing in oil stocks looks like a smart option Geopolitical Tensions  Supply Bottlenecks Boost PricesThis has been a particularly good year for crude prices  with WTI crude gaining nearly  15 since the start of 2019  This is primarily due to tight supplies  which in turn is attributable to three different sources First  U S  sanctions have led to a considerable decline in exports from Iran  taking a significant amount of supply off the markets  OPEC s output controls continue to support prices and are likely to remain in place for the entire year Another factor boosting prices is the disruption in supplies from Russia  The country s crude output has continued to decline in May  per Reuters  This is attributable to a reduction in exports following the detection of contaminated shipments to Europe in April Can Rising Shale Output Cap Gains However  Morgan Stanley thinks that the success of U S  shale producers will cap price gains in the longer term  Its freshly released report does agree that growth in output is declining  However  the report suggests that volumes could still increase considerably in the future  Shale producers are using digitization  automation and robotics to slowly but surely boost their output levels Further  since shale oil is an abundant resource  costs should decline as the associated technology improves  This in turn could lead cartels like OPEC to cut prices as well in order to effectively compete with their U S  counterparts But the report takes a rather long term view and is overly optimistic about shale prospects  per market watchers  They point to the fact that breakeven levels have remained unchanged despite the cost savings incurred from the improvement in technology Per a report from the Post Carbon Institute  intensive drilling and increases in capacity have only front loaded production  leaving actual output relatively the same  Even Morgan Stanley s report assumes that the E P industry will overcome most operational obstacles  acknowledging that inability to do so would prevent production from reaching its true potential Our ChoicesThe success of U S  shale has led several leading agencies to predict that crude prices could remain soft in the longer term  However  such an outcome is subject to several caveats  All of these assume that the industry will be able to overcome operational bottlenecks quickly and easily Meanwhile  the geopolitical tensions and supply bottlenecks which propelled crude higher this year remain very much in place  This is why it makes good sense to add oil stocks to your portfolio  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that

factor  and cost control to generate better operating results  As a result  we achieved good operating results  with recurring EBITDA margin increasing by 3 7 p p  in relation to 3Q16  Factors of the Earnings Guidance IncreaseDue to improved demand both domestically and internationally  an expanding Brazilian economy  an upturn in the number of total seats  and international development

cleaner  safer  healthier world  Its products include equipment for maintaining surfaces in industrial  commercial and outdoor environments  detergent free and other sustainable cleaning technologies  and coatings for protecting  repairing and upgrading surfaces  Tennant s global field service network is the most extensive in the industry Recent Earnings DataThe company posted net sales of  262  million which was a record for a third quarter  and net income of  3 6 million   But gross margins fell to 39 9  from 42 6  in the year ago quarter   This decline was due to  continued pressure form field service productivity  manufacturing inefficiencies  and raw material inflation   Further  selling and administrative  S A  expensed increased to  85 7 million  32 7  of sales  from  60 6 million  30 3  of sales from the year ago quarter   This increase in spending offset the companies cost reduction initiatives Decreased GuidanceDuring the earnings report  management decreased guidance for both FY 17 reported GAAP earnings  and adjusted earnings per share   Tennant now expects 2017 fully year reported GAAP earnings in the range of  0 05 to  0 25  down from the previously expected range of  0 85 to  1 05 per share   Further  adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of  1 50 to  1 70  well below the earlier expected range of  2 20 to  2 40   According to the report   The change in guidance is attributed to continued operational challenges within our business  including field service productivity  manufacturing efficiencies  and raw material inflation  which accounted for approximately  0 37 per share  Management s TakeAccording to Chris Killingstad  President and CEO   Our third quarter results reflect slower growth in North America attributed to timing of key strategic account deals  the restructuring of our field service team  continued manufacturing inefficiencies and raw material inflation  matters we continue to address   While we faced some near term setbacks  we are staying the course strategically and positioning Tennant to be operationally stronger than ever before  We are ahead of our acquisition plans for IPC  our core Tennant EMEA business grew by 14 6 percent in the quarter and a steady stream of new products has raised our vitality index to 47 percent  I remain confident that we are building the right platform for long term

3022,224537,CLMT,MLP Stocks Slide On FERC Ruling  Is There An Opportunity ,opinion,There seems to be no respite for the energy infrastructure master limited partnerships  or MLPs   If the Trump administration s proposed 25  tariff on imported steel were not enough  now midstream network providers have found themselves entangled in an FERC tax ruling  bleeding them even further The benchmark Alerian MLP Index   tracking 40 partnerships   suffered its worst fall in more than two years on Thursday in a sell off sparked by concerns of lower tariffs and cash flows  While selling hit most sector constituents  Plains All American Pipeline L P    NYSE PAA   and Energy Transfer Partners L P    NYSE ETP   were two of the biggest daily percentage decliners The Business of MLPs   Advantages of The StructureMLPs differ from regular stocks in that interests in them are referred to as units and the unitholders  not shareholders  are partners in the business  Importantly  these hybrid entities bring together the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities  The assets that these partnerships own typically   oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities MLPs represent an attractive investment option for income focused investors in the current environment  In addition to high yields  MLPs are structured as pass through entities This means that they typically distribute nearly all of their cash flows back to unitholders  The MLPs are not required to pay a corporate income tax as the tax liability of the entity is passed on to its owners  or unitholders  in the form of a cash dividend  distribution   This allows the MLPs to offer very attractive yields to the investors The FERC Tax RulingOn Mar 15  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   FERC   ruled that the interstate oil and natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs can no longer avail a credit for income taxes they do not pay  Revising its 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs  the federal regulators found that the longstanding income tax allowance in their cost of service fees could lead to double recovery of costs for the asset class who are pass through entities not subject to corporate income taxes The Net Effect of the Policy RevisionLooking ahead  the FERC policy revision signals significant future changes on how the pipeline partnerships will go about treating income taxes in their books of accounts As mentioned above  MLPs  being pass through entities  allocates their pre tax income to unitholders on a proportionate basis  The unitholders are then responsible for paying their own share of the partnership s tax obligation  Therefore  the FERC felt that its 2005 policy on income tax allowance provided the partnerships an unfair benefit  possibly resulting in double recovery of costs and boosting their distributable cash flows FERC s recent tax policy change is aimed at addressing this issue  The regulatory body is expected to issue a formal rulemaking guide  outlining the impact of the removal of income tax allowance on interstate pipeline rates Consequently  partnerships charging cost based rates for interstate transportation service would have to lower customer tariffs to move oil  gas and refined products around the country by the amount of their income tax allowances   substantial in certain cases  A reduction in cost recovery would likely cut into their cash flows Impact on MLPSWhile the FERC ruling is definitely a negative for MLPs  it must be remembered that the move will not affect all partnerships and assets  In particular  the changes are not likely to impact pipeline companies that are structured as  C Corporations   and not as MLPs  like Kinder Morgan  Inc    NYSE KMI   and ONEOK  Inc    NYSE OKE    The federal revision will also not apply to MLPs owning midstream assets that begin and terminate within the same state On the other hand  MLPs with significant  cost of service  exposure and large amounts of interstate pipelines   including Energy Transfer Partners and Spectra Energy  F SEP  Partners   NYSE SEP     look to be in most trouble  The change in income tax policies will result in rate reduction  and therefore lower cash flow for pipelines owned by these MLPs That said  all midstream operators with interstate pipelines will not be equally affected by the FERC ruling on tax allowances  with the impact essentially depending on how they charge rates  For example  pipelines under cost of service rates will be impacted but those subject to market based or negotiated tariffs won t be materially affected What NextThough a number of MLPs came out with press releases claiming negligible or no material impact from the FERC ruling  the tax policy change has gripped the sector with wide ranging concerns and uncertainty  With the new rule expected to be adopted only by 2020  the issue may remain a thorn in the flesh for the foreseeable future Opportunity for Bottom FishingThe speed of Thursday s jaw dropping sell off send MLP investors in a panic  Most of them are still jittery and are waiting for the dust to settle before coming back to the market  In particular  they will be carefully analyzing the partnerships  press releases related to FERC s ruling wherein the companies gradually come out with disclosures associated with cost of service exposure and potential impact to their cash flows However  most analysts saw the broad selling as an overreaction with enough opportunity to wade back in the industry  If you are a savvy investor   meaning you see a buying opportunity when stocks sell off   then it may be time to look at MLPs  One might opt for fundamentally strong names that are not likely to be impacted from the FERC rule change but got unfairly punished when the sector as a whole took a turn lower We have shortlisted two of them   Calumet Specialty Products Partners  L P    NASDAQ CLMT   and Oasis Midstream Partners L P    NYSE OMP     carrying Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Calumet Specialty Products Partners is a major North American producer of high quality  specialty products and fuels  The Indianapolis  IN based partnership makes a significant portion of its money by processing crude oil into lubricating oils  solvents  waxes  and other petroleum products  These activities would experience no impact from the FERC change Oasis Midstream Partners is primarily focused on production gathering and gas processing  The Houston  TX based partnership s tariffs come from its economic interests in gathering pipelines  processing facilities and storage facilities  which will see no material effect from FERC s policy revision More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of

3023,224538,CLMT,5 Value Stocks Under  10,opinion," 0     Value Stocks Under  10 2     Stock Screener 4     Tracey s Top Stock Picks 12     Warning Signs  What Happens If A Company Goes Bankrupt  16     Episode Roundup  Podcast Zacks comWelcome to Episode  66 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
With many well known growth stocks now trading at over  100 a share  Tracey decided to look for some stocks that you could buy at the opposite end of the spectrum  at under  10 
But she didn t just want low cost stocks  She also wanted them to have value fundamentals  She wanted stocks that were genuinely  cheap  by both share price and fundamentals 
Screening for Stocks Under  10
Tracey ran a screen that included  of course  stocks trading under  10  along with a Price to Sales Ratio  P S  under 1 0  Remember  a P S ratio under 1 0 usually indicates value 
For example  if a company has a P S ratio of 0 3  that means an investor is paying 30 cents for every  1 in sales  A bargain 
Tracey also added a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold   She included  holds  because it is still earnings season and many companies haven t yet reported  which will impact the Zacks Rank  Including holds also will give a wider set of names 
The screen gave her 237 results  but some were penny stocks  Tracey stayed away from those 
What was in the Screen  
Lots of energy names  especially drilling services companies  as well as retailers made the list 
But she narrowed it down to just 5 of them  These stocks are cheap but some of them are extremely out of favor on the Street 
It takes guts to be a value investor 
5 Value Stocks Under  10
1      The Container Store    NYSE TCS    has struggled almost from the first day of its IPO  Shares are down 91  from the 2014 IPO and are now trading under  5  This is one of the most hated retailers on the Street  by investors  But as value investors  that s why we take a look  It is expected to make  0 35 in 2017 and  0 39 in 2018  which is earnings growth of 25  
2     Noodles   Company    NASDAQ NDLS    has been abandoned by investors as shares have sunk 88   It has a P S ratio of just 0 3 but is expected to lose  0 01 this year  That s coming off of a loss of  0 17 in 2016  Watch its upcoming earnings report 
3     The Manitowoc Company    NYSE MTW    is one of the largest crane manufacturers in the United States  Founded in 1925  its seen some tough times in its history  It s expected to lose  0 15 this year but rebound to  0 07 a share in 2018 
4     Calumet Specialty Products    NASDAQ CLMT    is a refiner of hydrocarbon products  It took a loss of  3 27 last year  is expected to cut that to just  0 25 this year but 2018 is showing another decline to a loss of  0 95  It hasn t reported yet either  Investors should be checking in on that conference call 
5     Fossil    NASDAQ FOSL    shares are down 57  year to date and now trade under  10 at around  7 80  It made  2 44 in 2016 but is only expected to make  0 68 in 2017  It s still cheap  even though estimates are getting cut  It trades with a forward P E of 12 4  Are watches really dead 
As always  investors should do their homework on any company they are buying  but especially on stocks under  10 
Some tips 
1      Is the company making money or does it have a plan to make money in the near future 
2     Are insiders buying now that the shares have plunged down 
3     Are there rumors of bankruptcy 
Listen in conference calls  Don t just read the transcripts  A lot can be learned by the tone of voice 
What else should investors know about buying value stocks under  10

3039,224554,CLMT,How To Trade The Oil Rally With ETFs   Stocks,opinion,After being hurt by Hurricane Harvey  positive sentiments have started building up in the oil space with a wave of positive news  Notably  U S  crude is trading below  50 00 per barrel while Brent oil is hovering around  55 00 per barrel  read    Improving TrendsThe historic output cut deal wherein OPEC  which accounts for one third of the global output  Russia and other producers agreed to curb production by 1 8 million barrels per day until next March  is now paying off  This is especially true as OPEC oil output declined in August for the first time since March  The 14 member cartel pumped in 32 76 million barrels per day last month  representing a 79 100 barrel per day drop from July  Hopes of further extension to the pact by at least three months are adding to the optimism in the oil market As the deal aims to check the oil supply glut that has weighed on crude prices for more than three years  OPEC sees signs of a tighter global market and thus raised its global demand outlook for next year  The cartel expects global consumption to rise by 1 42 million barrels per day this year and 1 35 million barrels per day next year  up 50 000 barrels per day and 70 000 barrels per day  respectively  from the previous projection  On the other hand  supply from non OPEC countries would remain unchanged at 780 000 barrels per day for this year but would decline by 100 000 barrel per day from the previous forecast to 1 million barrels per day for next year The International Energy Agency  IEA  projects global demand this year to climb the most in two years as global glut has started to shrink due to stronger than expected consumption in Europe and the United States as well as production declines in OPEC and non OPEC countries It raised global oil demand outlook by 1 7  to 1 6 million barrels per day for this year and by 1 4  to 1 4 million barrels per day for the next  read    Though inventories in developed economies are still 195 million barrels above the five year average  it declined by 18 7 million barrels per day in July and will soon fall to this level given robust demand outlook and falling supplies  Unrest in Iraq and Venezuela will also keep output at check If these weren t enough  the U S  Energy Information Administration lowered its oil production forecast for this year and the next by 1  and 0 7   respectively  The agency expects crude production at an average 9 25 million barrels per day for this year and 9 84 million barrels a day for the next  State of Backwardation  A Big Bull for OilFurther  the oil market has entered into a state of backwardation  where later dated contracts are cheaper than near term contracts  after three long years when oil price was above  100 per barrel  This signals that the oil market is tightening and demand is robust  paving the way for oil rally  Futures contracts for Nov 2017 Brent crude is  55 16  higher than the  54 86 futures

3043,224558,CLMT,Dividend Roulette With Refinery MLPs,opinion,"Upstream master limited partnerships  MLPs  have been generally devastated by the decline in oil and gas prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 
Some bankruptcies have occurred  and distributions   the MLP equivalent to corporate dividends and the reason most investors bought these companies   have been slashed 
However  one segment of the energy MLP universe has gone from strength to strength  companies whose principal assets are  
These downstream MLPs offer yields well into the double digits  plus all the excitement of a quarterly earnings roller coaster 
While oil prices remain low  they re an excellent investment   provided you don t need to sleep at night 
A Refined Opportunity
According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  U S  oil refinery capacity has increased 14 8  since 1985  less than half of the 35  population increase during that period 
Although refiners have added capacity and several small refineries have been built recently  the last major U S  refinery to come on stream was completed in 1977 
Additionally  environmental and legal harassments make it unlikely that refiners will add significant capacity in the near future 
Meanwhile  oil prices are down 50  in the last year  and demand for crude oil and refined products has risen by around 5   with a further upward trend likely as consumers drive more and also shift to more gas guzzling vehicles 
On top of all that  three more factors   the United States  increasing self sufficiency in crude oil  the lack of refined products available for import  and increasing overseas demand for products refined in the United States and Canada   have all put further pressure on U S  refineries 
In total  these factors have produced a tightness in U S  refinery utilization that s not likely to diminish until or unless oil prices return to  100 per barrel levels 
Accordingly  margins in the refining business are likely to remain elevated  and capacity utilization is likely to remain close to 100  
That means refinery MLPs should earn good returns  which they ll be forced to distribute 
Best of all  the market hasn t fully adjusted to this new reality  which makes the yields available on refinery MLP stocks truly juicy 
High Risk  High Reward
There are four refinery MLPs  three of which appear attractive for investors 

Northern Tier Energy LP  N NTI  gives you a truly spectacular current yield of 17 7   based on the last four quarters of distributions   though that s not quite covered by earnings over that same period 

However  in the third quarter  Northern Tier earned  1 11 and will go ex distribution on November 12 on a  1 04 distribution  to be paid on November 25  That s very satisfactory indeed 
Northern Tier went public only in 2012  and quarterly distributions since then have fluctuated from  0 31 to  1 48   the classic profile of a refinery MLP  Right now  Northern Tier is selling at 5 1 times book value  with negative tangible net worth  and in the past year its stock price has increased by 5   adding just a bit extra to that incredible yield 

CVR Refining LP  N CVRR  is a large refiner in Coffeyville  Kansas  whose shares currently yield 17 8   based on the last four quarters of distributions  Earnings didn t quite cover the distribution over that period  though the company did cover in the second quarter 

In the third quarter of 2015  CVR Refining earned  0 94 per share compared with a  1 01 distribution  which has just gone ex distribution and will be paid on November 16 
Unlike Northern Tier  CVR Refining s stock price has declined 6  in the past year  though even net of that decline its return is attractive  It also has the additional advantage of a positive net worth  and it trades at 2 1 times book value 

Alon USA Partners LP  N ALDW   which owns a 73 000 barrel per day refinery in Big Spring  Texas  currently yields 16 9   though its distribution isn t quite covered by earnings 

Most recently  it announced third quarter earnings of  0 86 per unit  and it will distribute  0 98 per unit  which goes ex distribution on November 16 and pays on November 25 
Alon has a positive tangible net worth  barely   sells at an eye watering 8 3 times book value  and its share price has risen 36  in the last 12 months  nice indeed but suggesting it may drop back a bit 

Finally  Calumet Specialty Products Partners  O CLMT  is the least attractive of the four  Although it has the broadest base of refined petroleum products  this doesn t seem to lead to much profitability  even when oil prices are weak  as at present 

Indeed  it managed to report a loss in the third quarter  a period when oil prices had sunk to new lows  Its quarterly distribution is  0 685  giving it a yield of 10 3  at current prices  However  that s not much good to us in the long run  since the company made a loss over the last four quarters 
What s more  the stock price is down 6  in the last 12 months  negating much of the benefit of the distribution  and it sells at 2 4 times book value  with a negative tangible net worth  I frankly don t understand why Calumet Specialty s broader range of products prevents it from being as profitable as its peers  so I d suggest avoiding it for now 
At the end of the day  these are risky stocks  but I can t see why the environment shouldn t continue to favor them for some time 
Plus  the 16  to 18  yields on the first three are not to be missed  They re like finding  100 bills in the street 
But go small  however tempting they may be

3046,224561,CLMT,CLMT  Great Long Term Set Up With A Great Short Term Launch,opinion,"Neely s B Failure Flat Set Up

A Crash Followed by a Partial Retrace Followed by a Return to the Crash Low is a Set Up for a Return to the All Time High
Glenn Neely s book    provides a useful collection of trading set ups and data  One particular set up in Neely s book that has paid off time and again in recent years is a formation he calls a B Failure Flat 
You tend to see these formations after crash waves like PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  s crash out of the dot com bubble and the big 2008 plunge in oil  If the crash wave takes a particular form  the reaction wave  or  B wave   that follows tends to retrace roughly 60  of the crash  It doesn t have to be 60   It just has to be a significant retrace that doesn t make it back to the high 
The B wave reaction tops with range trading  typically forming a head and shoulders or megaphone top or an extended triangle  then the price collapses  in a  C wave   back to the crash wave low 
Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT  is about to complete this pattern  After it completes a bottom  its next target is the all time high 
Here s the set up on QQQ 


Neely B Failure Flat Set Up on QQQ
Here s the set up on oil 


Same Set Up on Oil
It s a set up about a price that is taking huge swings around a correct price roughly in the middle 
A Great Short Term Entry is Setting Up for CLMT s Big Move Up


CLMT Opted to Start a Bottoming Pattern in the Critical Decision Wave of its Navy Price Channel
CLMT appears to be putting in an island bottom with a neckline at roughly 6  see top chart   Obviously a gap up from an island bottom would be a great set up to get long 
But for more nimble traders  a beautiful price channel bottoming set up can get you in closer to the bottom 
Specifically  on the move down out of the early 2017 high  CLMT confirmed a price channel  navy blue in chart above   And in the channel s critical decision wave  meaning the new channel low after two alternating touches on both the top and bottom   CLMT took a swing back up to the channel top rather than breaking out the bottom 
That channel provided a beautiful melt down set up to zero if CLMT was heading into bankruptcy  Instead CLMT started a megaphone bottom  pink in chart   A breakout now through the channel top would target roughly the pink megaphone top at the 200 dma  A final retest of the 40 dma would be the retrace to the pink megaphone VWAP that would set up a breakout up to the island bottom neckline at 6 
Typically there would be a bit of a consolidation there before the gap up into the big move up 
CLMT would typically bog down at roughly the 30 level on its big move up usually to attempt a topping pattern like a head and shoulders at the red megaphone VWAP  The topping pattern would usually end up breaking out upwards to set up a big rising megaphone melt up back to the all time high 
We could also see a big Sornette melt up set up across 30 before blast off 
Hat tip to  jasteindorf1 for the stock  He has personal expertise in this company and product  The view of the stock provided  however  is strictly based on chart trading set ups  not fundamentals  Do your own due diligence 
You could long on the price channel breakout and set your stop a little below the pink megaphone VWAP or 40 dma after breaking through ",2017-04-24,Trader Moe,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clmt-–-great-long-term-set-up-with-a-great-short-term-launch-200184524,200184524

NASDAQ   NASDAQ IMMU      and Hudbay Minerals  NYSE   TO HBM      By Kevin MatrasExplosive Stocks Under  10This screen is a bit of a departure from my normal stock screens Usually I require my screens to have a minimum price of  10 per share But I do at times scan for stocks under  10  And that s one of the screens I m running for myself right now Penny StocksOne dollar is a common threshold when screening for stocks  A lot of investors actively avoid penny stocks due to the speculative nature  the often wide bid ask spreads  and the excessive volatility that is all too common in stocks under  1 00 But some  of course  work out spectacularly well  And that s probably what keeps people interested in them Seeing a stock make a 100  return or 200  return or more from a base of 50 cents  for example  seems easier than investing in a  50 stock or  100 stock and seeing that double or triple  5 StocksFive dollars is another common minimum when screening for stocks since many institutional investors won t even consider a stock if it s trading under  5  And since institutional investors are usually the ones that can move a stock  having stocks that are open to them is usually a bonus And quite frankly  lots of cheap stocks are cheap for a reason  i e   that s all they re worth But being over  5 does put them into a different category of consideration  Maybe not the best category  but a step up from stocks less than a dollar Stocks Under  10My minimum has typically been  10  With over 10 000 stocks out there  this minimum quickly lets me cull down several thousand stocks with a click of a button That doesn t mean there aren t any good stocks below that price point  because there are And I can recall several sub  10 stocks in the past that worked out exceptionally well  Maybe it s because I use them sparingly  Or maybe it s because I m ultra picky in selecting them Either way  there can be a place for cheaper stocks in your portfolio sometimes And that s what we re looking at today Screen Parameters  Price less than or equal to  10  Average Dollar Volume greater than or equal to  1 000 000 Price x volume shows you how much money is trading in and out of the stock on a daily basis    Weekly Volume greater than Previous Week s Volume  any two out of three weeks  Want to see increasing volume to show greater investor interest and demand    Zacks Rank less than or

     Hudbay MineralsI think each one of these picks has big potential  And the entire list is worth a thorough analysis I would not suggest filling up an entire portfolio of stocks under  10 though  But adding a careful selection of some of the best cheap stock names could add some excess returns to your bottom line  not to mention a little excitement to your stock picking process as well Get the

3063,224578,CLMT,3 High Yield Stocks with Great Growth Prospects,opinion,"Markets suffered heavy losses on Friday following heightened international concerns  The S P 500 and the Dow both registered their worst one day percentage declines in more than three weeks  More significantly  all benchmarks closed in the red for the week after two successive weekly gains  Following losses for the month of March  these losses once again raise questions about the kind of volatility stocks may have to face in the days ahead 
More Volatility Ahead 
The first holiday shortened week of April saw two benchmarks registering weekly gains even as the NASDAQ declined  Despite last week s losses  all benchmarks have gained over the month till date  Additionally  the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   also known as the fear gauge of the markets  had moved lower recently  Such a movement signals a reduction in market volatility and consequently an increase in investor confidence 
But on Friday  the market s fear gauge increased 10 2  to settle at 13 89  The VIX had gained in excess of 11  in early trading  This is a clear indication that volatility has returned to plague investors  Also  most of the data released last week was dismal in nature  Reports on housing  jobless claims  retail sales and CPI were uniformly disappointing 
Long Term Fundamentals Strong
However  long term fundamentals of the U S  economy and equity markets remain firmly in place  The job situation continues to improve and the Fed is set to raise rates later this year  The economies of Europe  China and Japan continue to display weakness  It is widely expected that the U S  will power the world s growth story this year 
Most market watchers believe that markets will stabilize by end 2015  However  they also expect volatility to continue on a day to day basis  In this environment  stocks offering high yields make for good choices  These stocks offer higher income in the current low rate environment and also offer a cushion against equity market risks 
Moreover  dividend stocks are historically less volatile than non dividend stocks and are proven outperformers over the long term  These stocks are a safe bet to create wealth  as the dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty 
These stocks provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis  At the same time  all benchmarks have gained over the year to date  This is why it is crucial to pick stocks that offer high yields but also offer the promise of growth when the markets eventually pick up steam 
Our Choices
To identity stocks that are offering high yields along with good growth prospects  we have relied on our new  
Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space 
Based upon the above criteria  we have selected three stocks that could be promising picks  Not only do these stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank and offer high yield  they also a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  
Sprague Resources LP operates as a supplier of energy and materials handling services  The company stores  distributes  and sells refined petroleum products and natural gas  Its products include home heating oil  diesel fuels  residual fuels  gasoline and natural gas 
Sprague Resources holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a Growth Style Score of  B   The company has dividend yield of 7  
Atlas Resource Partners LP  NYSE ARP  develops and produces crude oil  natural gas and related liquids  Atlas Resource Partners operates in basins located across the U S   including Colorado  Tennessee and Indiana 
Atlas Resource Partners holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a Growth Style Score of  A   The company has dividend yield of 14 9  
Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT  produces specialty hydrocarbon products in North America  Calumet focusses on processing crude oil into customized lubricating oils  solvents  and waxes used in consumer  industrial  and automotive products 
Apart from a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Calumet Specialty Products has a Growth Style Score of  A   The company has dividend yield of 10 4  
Dealing with volatility is something investors may have to get used to in 2015  At the same the time  growth prospects cannot be ignored in an effort to hedge risk  This is why these stocks would make for good additions to your portfolio ",2015-04-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-high-yield-stocks-with-great-growth-prospects-249065,249065
3065,224580,CLMT,Trade War Worsens And Everyone Is Weighing In,opinion,"The Trump Navarro trade war rhetoric ratchets higher  And jawboning the Fed is now added to the turmoil  our colleague Bob Eisenbeis has recently reflected on that one here  Meanwhile  most of the world is now labeled a currency manipulator by POTUS in his latest salvo 
For those who missed the discussion I had on Bloomberg Radio with Bryan Curtis and Rishaad Salamat about trade and the secondary impacts of the trade war here  The clip is seven minutes 
The stock market remains somewhat immune to the Twitter storms  The US Treasury yield curve remains in flat to flattening mode  And the earnings from the second quarter reports mostly exceed expectations 
We enter August and the summer hurricane season with a blizzard of bizarre policy lurches originating in Washington  Meanwhile the evidence of damage from the trade war grows daily  Markets may want to ignore these anecdotes  We think they deserve more respect 
Bullets 
For those who missed it  here is the Trump threat of the  505 billion tariff war escalation   Trump says he s  ready  to put tariffs on all  505 billion of Chinese goods imported to the US  President Donald Trump has indicated that he is willing to slap tariffs on every Chinese good imported to the US should the need arise  
 Steel prices have gone up after the trade war broke out   says Torsten Slok  Deutsche Bank Securities  Torsten notes a 40  rise in the futures prices of Midwest Domestic Hot Rolled Coil Index futures 
 The Trump administration announced last Tuesday that it is prepared to impose 10  tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese made products  ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators  Together with other tariffs already in the works  the latest move threatens to raise import prices on almost half of everything the US buys from China  which means that Inflation could be one of the biggest disruptions to US equity and bond markets from the escalating trade war     Joe McAlinden  former CIO and Chief Global Strategist at Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Investment Management  where he oversaw more than  400 billion dollars in assets

Here is Danielle DiMartino Booth  focused on clues that we may discern about trade war damage   Unlike some states with waning manufacturing sectors dominated by a handful of factories that have lingered  US Steel is but one of many manufacturers populating the state of Indiana     Some of the biggies include pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   engine builder Cummins  NYSE CMI   Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT   a refiner  plastics manufacturer Berry Global  NYSE BERY   and medical device maker Zimmer Biomet  NYSE ZBH    Add up all the manufacturers  big and small  from Lake Michigan to the Ohio River  and you re talking about a powerhouse state  At 28 6  of its gross state product  Indiana relies more than any other state on its manufacturing sector  According to the Indiana Manufacturing Association  the Hoosier State s manufacturing output passed the  100 billion for the first time last year  Only California  Illinois  North Carolina  Ohio  and Texas have larger sectors   In the event you don t know where this is headed  the Hoosier State is also the 11th largest exporting state  Its economy relies more on its factory sector than any other  and it is thus the primary state to monitor for damage emanating from the trade war   Combine the trade war headwinds  Indiana s strengths cum weaknesses of manufacturing and export industries and the state s richly valued jobless claims  and you have a recipe for a correction on your hands   Applying the same three gauges   manufacturing as a share of the state s economy  exports  and jobless claims trends   to the rest of the country  we can identify the other nine most exposed states to round out our Top Ten list  They are  listed in descending order of exposure  North Carolina  Oregon  Wisconsin  Washington  Ohio  Michigan  South Carolina  Alabama  and Georgia  These are the states where the good economic deeds accomplished can perversely come back to haunt them  
Politico on July 19  Morning Money  reported that  The Commerce Department is holding a day long hearing on Thursday to hear from 45 witnesses in their investigation into whether imported automobiles and parts present a national security threat and should be subject to tariffs of up to 25 percent  It is not likely to go well for proponents of such tariffs  Per POLITICO trade ace Doug Palmer  all but one of the scheduled witnesses will testify AGAINST the tariffs  The U S  automotive industry almost uniformly opposes the tariffs   Note this item revealed by Senator Doug Jones   Just one of out 45 witnesses today is expected to testify in favor of imposing tariffs on autos and auto     The lone exception is Jennifer Kelly  research director of the United Automobile Workers  which revealed its support in public comments filed last month with the department  
More on autos from Politico   Nearly all of the 44 other witnesses filed comments expressing opposition to President Donald Trump s threat to impose a 20 or 25 percent duty on foreign made autos and parts  Those include the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers  which represents Ford  GM  Fiat Chrysler  as well as foreign brands such as Mercedes Benz  Honda  Toyota  Hyundai  Volkswagen  Nissan and Subaru  Auto dealers and parts manufacturers also will testify in opposition to the tariffs  which a forthcoming paper by the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates would raise car prices by  1 408 to  2 057 for a  17 000 vehicle   2 093 to  3 066 for a  22 500 vehicle  and  4 708 to  6 972 for a  35 000 vehicle  
Dear readers  we will stop here  We have already mentioned in previous writings the trade war impacts unfolding in the agriculture sector  from soybeans to lobsters  Now this round is about the manufacturing sector 
The lessons of history are clear and have no exceptions  Everyone loses in a trade war  The Trump Navarro policy is hurtling toward a disaster if history is any guide  Many believe that the present policy direction will undo all the benefits of the tax cuts  repatriations  and fiscal stimulus  We are among those who are seriously worried about these outcomes 
We expect upward inflation price pressures  slowing of growth rates  and lurching gyrations in the foreign currency exchange markets  We don t know where this ends  We are applying caution in all portfolios

3070,224585,CLMT,Stocks Recoup Monday s Losses  Dow Adds 112,opinion,Investors pushed the major averages higher on Tuesday a day after the market fell in the wake of a bailout for Cyprus  Sentiment was boosted by a series of economic reports in the United States that showed the housing market is on the mend and the economy remains stable  Consumer confidence data  however  was a surprise disappointment  Nevertheless  investors were looking to take risk as the markets may be prepared to move beyond the situation in Cyprus next week  Major Averages The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 112 points  or 0 77 percent  to 14 560  The S P 500 rose better than 12 points  or 0 78 percent  to 1 564  The Nasdaq added 17 points  or 0 53 percent  to 3 252  Durable Goods Orders Durable

largely due to transportation with transportation equipment orders jumping 21 7 percent  Not including transportation  durable goods orders declined 0 5 percent  Consumer Confidence Consumer confidence data released on Tuesday was a cause for concern  The Conference Board s Consumer Confidence report for March showed a steep decline to 59 7 from 68 0 in the prior month  This was way below economists  consensus estimates of a decline to 65 0  The Expectations Index also fell from 72 4 down to 60 9  Although confidence is important to economic activity  the primary driver is income growth  The steep decline  however  suggests that the consumer outlook is not as rosy as had been hoped  New Home Sales New home sales fell 4 6 percent on a month over month basis in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 411 000  This missed consensus estimates of 426 000  but was a significant 12 3 percent increase over last year  On a regional basis  sales fell 13 3 percent in the Northeast  rose 13 7 percent in the Midwest  fell 9 7 percent in the South and declined 2 1 percent in the West  Nevertheless  the data was strong on a year over year basis and the housing market

was down better than one percent  Bonds Heading into the closing bell  the iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NYSE     was up 0 11 percent to  117 35  The small gain for bonds pushed yields lower  The 2 Year Note yield was unchanged at 0 25 percent  but the 5 Year Note yield fell by one basis point to 0 77 percent  The yield on the 10 Year Note and 30 Year Bond fell two and one basis point to 1 90 percent and 3 14 percent  respectively  Currencies The U S  dollar was unchanged on Tuesday  with the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF  NYSE     which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of foreign currencies  trading around the flat line late in the day  The closely watched EUR USD pair was also unchanged on the session at  1 2857  The USD JPY rose 0 34 percent on Tuesday while the USD CAD fell 0 51 percent  Volatility and Volume The VIX fell sharply on Tuesday as the Dow climbed better than triple digits  The widely watched fear guage lost almost 8

3073,224588,CLMT,Pick Your Energy MLPs Carefully,opinion,"Crude Oil prices appear to have settled around  50  half the level of last summer 
For income investors  that has played merry hell with the economics of energy master limited partnerships  previously considered one of the most attractive sources of high  stable dividends 
A number of energy MLPs have slashed their dividends  and even appear likely to operate at a loss going forward  However  there are still substantial parts of the sector where dividends appear more reliable  and income investors should seek out these lucrative opportunities 
The biggest problems have arisen in energy MLPs that own reserves and produce oil from them  which isn t surprising  After all  if the price of your product halves  you re bound to struggle  But it also reflects a deeper reality  Many MLPs represent pools of assets spun off in recent years with relatively high cost bases 
Now  a Saudi Arabian MLP would still be profitable  because Saudi Arabia s production costs are a fraction of the current oil prices  However  marginal producers in high cost sectors  especially those using expensive  fracking  techniques  are much harder to manage 
That s why companies such as Linn Energy LLC  NASDAQ LINE  and BreitBurn Energy Partners LP  NASDAQ BBEP  recently  and are struggling to remain profitable 
Mining the Midstream
In the middle are  that make their money from transporting and storing energy  Lower energy prices are generally beneficial for these MLPs  as lower prices increase demand  consumption  and throughput  On the other hand  if they own oil or receive revenue on a percentage royalty basis  they may be exposed to price declines 
Recently  their earnings have been relatively strong  but the largest and most stable of these companies tend to have high price tags  Enbridge Energy Partners LP  NYSE EEP   for example  has a forward P E multiple of 27x  and a trailing P E of infinity   although its 5 9  dividend yield is attractive 
Plains All American Pipeline LP  NYSE PAA   a  19 billion MLP  has a yield of 5 2  and a forward P E multiple of a somewhat more reasonable 19 8x  Both of these companies earn less than the dividends they pay  because pipelines can be depreciated  causing non cash operating costs  Conversely  they have a finite life  so their earnings may be a truer guide to their value than the dividends 
Finally  World Point Terminals  which stores refined and crude oil products  has a dividend yield of 6  and a forward P E multiple of a slightly more reasonable 17 2x  All three of these companies are attractive income investments in today s low interest rate world  because their profits are more or less independent of oil prices 
A Few Refined Opportunities
Finally  there s one group of income oriented companies that benefits from oil price declines  MLPs that own  
Oil refineries benefit from falling crude prices in several ways  First  a decline in the price of gasoline and other oil products increases consumption  Motorists drive more and switch to more gas guzzling cars  SUVs  and trucks  while many energy users switch to petroleum products 
Refineries may also benefit from weak crude prices because their output prices can be held  sticky  as their input prices decline 
Of course  refining company earnings fluctuate greatly from quarter to quarter  which normally leads dividends to be highly variable  as well  To get around this problem  some refining companies pay dividends out of capital in periods when earnings are depressed   though  you should worry about the extent to which the investment is self liquidating  You don t want it to leave you with nothing after a relatively short period 
And since refineries themselves have a finite life  require refurbishment  and deliver a fluctuating cash flow  there s a fair amount of risk inherent when investing in them  especially over a very long period  such as retirement 
Still  their yields can be truly attractive in periods of weak oil prices  Thus  I ve identified three refinery assets worth considering in today s environment 
Refinery Asset No  1  Calumet Specialty Products Partners  NASDAQ CLMT   Calumet specializes in the kind of offbeat petroleum related products with sales volume that can increase rapidly when prices fall  Its quarterly dividend was  0 63 in 2008  then fell to  0 45 during the 2009 recession as sales of its varied product line fell  Since then  it has recovered to a current level of  0 685  giving it a yield of 10 8  at current prices  However  third quarter earnings were only  0 08 per share after  0 25 of derivatives losses   nowhere near covering the current dividend  Fourth quarter earnings are due February 27  If they exceed the quarter s dividend  this looks like a good  Buy  
Refinery Asset No  2  Northern Tier Energy LP  NYSE NTI   Northern will give you a truly spectacular current yield of 12 7   based on the last four quarters  dividends  and it appears able to justify that from current operations  However  it went public only in 2012  and quarterly dividends since then have fluctuated from  0 31 to  1 48   the classic profile of a refinery MLP  NTI made  1 04 per unit in the third quarter and distributed  1  but its fourth quarter dividend  to be paid February 27  was a somewhat disappointing  0 49  Still  that yield is very attractive  and unlike CLMT  NTI doesn t seem to pay out more than it earns 
Refinery Asset No  3  CVR Refining  CVRR   CVR Refining is a large refiner in Coffeyville  Kansas  with shares currently yielding 10 7   based on the last four quarters  dividends  But the latest dividend  with an ex dividend date of February 26  was only  0 37   and fourth quarter earnings showed a loss of  112 million because of a FIFO accounting loss of  154 6 million  a one off caused by the fall in oil prices   For the year as a whole  CVRR made  2 43 per share and paid dividends of  2 16 
Which refinery you buy depends on how much risk you want  but the right energy MLPs are still worth looking at

However  sentiment on the greenback remained fragile as Senate Republican leaders said they were considering postponing the implementation of the major corporate tax cut until 2019 
Meanwhile  a House tax reform bill  which differs from the Senate version  would be expected to take effect next year 
If the Senate and House pass separate tax bills  lawmakers will have to reconcile them

3091,224606,CLMT,Exclusive  Chevron  Exxon seek  small refinery  waivers from U S  biofuels law,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK  Reuters    Global energy giants  Chevron  Corp and  Exxon Mobil  have asked U S  regulators for exemptions to the nation s biofuels policy that have historically been reserved for small companies in financial distress  according to sources familiar with the matter  The requests will add fuel to a raging dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over how the Trump administration should manage the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard   a 2005 law that requires oil refiners to mix biofuels such as corn based ethanol into the nation s fuel supply  or buy government awarded credits from other energy firms who do the blending  The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has already issued an unusually high 25 hardship waivers to small refineries in recent months  according to an agency source  driving blending credit prices down and helping the oil industry reduce compliance costs  But the agency won t name the firms receiving the exemptions  citing a concern over disclosing private company information  Both Chevron  N CVX  and Exxon  N XOM   among the world s most profitable energy companies  have asked EPA for waivers for their smallest facilities   Chevron s 54 500 barrel per day refinery in Utah and the Exxon s 60 000 bpd refinery in Montana  two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity   The exemptions would free the plants from their obligation to hand in blending credits earned or purchased for 2017  which came due this year  the sources said  The disclosure of the Chevron and Exxon applications  which have not been previously reported  follow a Reuters report this month that the EPA has exempted three of ten refineries owned by Andeavor  N ANDV   one of the biggest U S  refining companies   The waivers could save Andeavor  50 million or more in regulatory costs for the company s 2016 obligations under the biofuels law  Husky Energy   a Canadian oil giant backed by a Hong Kong billionaire   will also be seeking an exemption  this one covering the 2018 requirements for its small Superior  Wisconsin plant  spokesman Mel Duval told Reuters  disclosing the waiver for the first time  Duval said Husky inherited a 2017 exemption when it bought the 50 000 bpd Superior refinery from  Calumet Specialty  Products Partners  O CLMT  for  435 million in November  The waivers are intended for facilities producing less than 75 000 barrels per day  bpd  that can also prove compliance with the policy would cause them  disproportionate economic hardship   A spokesman for Chevron  Braden Reddall  declined to confirm or deny the application  but said waivers provide an edge   Several competitors have reportedly received exemptions from the RFS   he said in a written statement to Reuters   If true  any refinery which has not been exempted from the RFS will be at a competitive disadvantage    Exxon spokesman Dan Carter declined to comment  The exceptions and the EPA s refusal to disclose them have infuriated the corn lobby  which argues the waivers hurt farmers by undermining demand for corn and should be used only sparingly for tiny facilities in dire straits   EPA is hiding behind poor excuses about proprietary business information to shield big oil companies from public scrutiny   five Republican senators  including Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst from Iowa  wrote in a joint statement Thursday    This looks like just another backdoor attempt by  EPA  Administrator  Scott  Pruitt to destroy the Renewable Fuel Standard and circumvent congressional intent    Bob Dinneen  head of the Renewable Fuels Association said there is nothing  small  about Exxon and Chevron  both of which rank in the top 20 of the Fortune 100    For these two behemoth oil companies to claim economic hardship is downright offensive and insulting to the hard working farm families and ethanol producers that depend on the RFS   Dinneen said  It s unclear whether the EPA has approved the Exxon or Chevron application  EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on which firms have applied for or received exemptions   She said the agency considers any application to exempt a refinery of less than 75 000 bpd   regardless of the size of the company that owns it   EPA decisions on waivers are based on refinery specific information   she said in an email   We continue to work through petitions received for 2017   Exxon reported net profits of  19 7 billion last year  Chevron reported earning  9 2 billion  Both bill themselves as globally integrated companies  and neither breaks out the financial details for their individual facilities in the public disclosures they are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission   Republican Senator John Barrasso  of Wyoming  home to several small refineries  praised the expansion of the exemption program in a statement on Thursday  He did not address the controversy over the exemptions granted to some of the nation s largest refiners   I applaud Administrator Pruitt and Secretary Perry for recognizing the burdens of this program  They know that we can t allow it to hurt our nation s small refineries   Barrasso said    DEMAND DESTRUCTION  The EPA has historically doled out fewer than ten hardship exemptions per year to U S  refineries  according to a former U S  official who spoke on condition of anonymity  A current EPA official  however  said the number reached 20 for 2016  The EPA has come under pressure for being stingy with the waivers in the past  A successful lawsuit last year by Sinclair Oil Corporation led a federal court to order EPA to expand its definition of  economic hardship    opening the door for more facilities to be eligible  The Trump administration has also signaled a willingness to help refining companies reduce their biofuels compliance costs   which industry players say has encouraged a surge in recent applications  Trump hosted a series of meetings with advocates for the corn and oil industries at the White House since late last year aimed at reforming biofuels regulations in a way that cuts costs for refiners without reducing overall biofuels demand  The effort failed to yield a deal due to protests from corn industry representatives  Obtaining a waiver helps refiners in two ways  they no longer have to earn or purchase blending credits  called RINs  to prove compliance  and they can sell any RINs they have on hand into the open market  That can provide a company with a benefit ranging into the tens of millions of dollars  Other big oil companies including Phillips 66  N PSX  also own refineries small enough to be eligible for a waiver  as does CVR Energy  N CVI  which is owned by billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn   Officials for those companies did not respond to requests for comment on whether they are seeking exemptions  Icahn s efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program   while acting as an adviser to Trump on regulatory issues   drew scrutiny from federal investigators after lawmakers said it raised ethical concerns  Biofuels proponents including U S  Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has criticized the use of RFS exemptions as  demand destruction  for corn based ethanol  Ethanol demand has been vital to farmers who are buffeted by low commodities prices and the threat of a global trade war  
The American Petroleum Institute  which represents big oil companies like Exxon and Chevron  has also opposed small refinery exemptions in the past  arguing for a level competitive playing field ",2018-04-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-chevron-exxon-seek-small-refinery-waivers-from-us-biofuels-law-1392559,1392559

3099,224614,CLMT,4 Top Ranked Oil Stocks To Buy On OPEC Cuts  Trade Truce ,opinion,On Jul 2  OPEC decided to extend the existing production cuts till March 2020  In doing so  the oil cartel successfully tided over internal differences  agreeing instead to reaffirm measures that supported oil prices in the recent past  Surging U S  shale output and global economic sluggishness have forced the production bloc to renew such measures several times now However  only a lasting U S  China trade deal can provide oil with sufficient upside in the second half of the year  Last week  both sides made major concessions  declaring a truce  Notably  Trump agreed to ease restrictions on Huawei  gladdening investors A near term rate  which looks increasingly likely  would also support higher levels of demand  This is why it still makes sense to bet on select oil stocks at this time OPEC Extends Production ControlsEven though the core group has decided to provide an extension to production controls  the deal still needs approval from non member countries  However  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said on Jul 2 that he was sure these countries  particularly Russia  would agree to the extension Currently  production controls stand at around 1 2 million barrels per day  A major factor for enforcing such controls has been the jump in U S  oil production  particularly from shale related sources However  al Falih thinks   U S  shale will peak and the decline like every other basin in history  over time  And till then such measures would be  prudent for us that have a lot at stake  as well as for those concerned about the global economy  he feels Trade Truce  Rate Cuts Key to Upside in 2H19Despite the extension of production controls  the future of oil prices will largely be determined by trade relations between the United States and China  According to Energy Aspects  chief oil analyst Amrita Sen  the price outlook will largely be guided by the outcome of the next round of U S  China talks Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday  Sen said that a lot depends on a U S  China trade deal since global demand has declined considerably  But she thinks that there  will be some momentum to solve some of these trade wars   probably alluding to the run up to the U S  presidential elections  Trump would want to do little to roil markets and the economy at this point Another factor potentially creating upside for oil prices for the rest of the year is the increasing likelihood of a near term rate cut  With the Federal Reserve intent on fashioning policy  which would support America s growth momentum  oil market demand could improve in the near future  thinks Sen  Our ChoicesOPEC s decision to extend production controls until early next year will go a long way in supporting oil prices in the near future  Upside potential has also been improved by the rising likelihood of better U S  China trade relations  especially in the run up to U S  presidential elections A near term rate cut by the Federal Reserve would also go a long way in supporting oil market demand  This is why it remains prudent to invest in oil stocks  However  picking winning stocks may be

3100,224615,CLMT,Sunoco  SUN  Hits 52 Week High  What s Behind The Uptrend ,opinion,Sunoco LP s   NYSE SUN   units attained a 52 week high of  32 44 on Jul 5  before eventually closing at  32 40  generating a healthy year to date rate of more than 19   Robust acquisitions  cost cut measures and high yield have been fueling the firm s performance  Notably  the partnership gained around 28 5  over a year against the broader  s decline of 6 2   Let s take a closer look at the factors driving the stock Repositioning of the Business Model Pays Off The strategic shift from partnership operated convenience stores to fuel supply business came to fruition  In January 2018  Sunoco closed the deal to divest most of its convivence stores to 7 Eleven to sharpen focus on the fuel supply business  Offloading bulk of retail assets was a big deal for Sunoco as those properties accounted for more than 33  of the partnership s top line  Nonetheless  the massive transformation worked much in favor of Sunoco as it trimmed the partnership s heavy debt burden and streamlined its portfolio  As part of the deal  Sunoco entered into a 15 year agreement with 7 Eleven to sell 2 2 billion gallons of fuel annually  thereby improving the partnership s financial profile and becoming a pure play for the distribution of gasoline The proceeds from the sale were used to tap opportunistic acquisitions Slew of Buyouts Bode WellSunoco s array of fuel distribution and terminal acquisitions are expected to be highly accretive to distributable cash flows  while realizing substantial cost synergies  The four bolt on purchases made in the course of 2018 should aid the partnership s net income and EBITDA significantly In April 2018  Sunoco had acquired the wholesale fuel distribution business from Superior Plus Corporation  The business distributes roughly 200 million gallons of fuel every year  To bolster the core fuel distribution business  Sunoco completed the Sanford Oil buyout last August to distribute roughly 115 million gallons of fuel every year The wholesale distribution businesses that Sunoco had acquired in Ohio  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and New York in December 2018 have the capacity to transport roughly 180 million gallons of fuel every year  Moreover  during 2018 end  it had acquired two refined products terminal businesses located in North Texas and Arkansas  with around 77 500 barrels per day of total throughput as well as 1 3 million barrels of storage capacity  All these acquisitions are expected to be highly accretive to the unitholder s cash flows going forward As it is  the partnership is poised to gain from strong gasoline demand and rising consumption of diesel fuel  Notably  the partnership expects extensive fuel distribution operations to distribute fuel volumes of 8 8 2 billion gallons through 2019  higher than 7 9 billion gallons in 2018 Cost Discipline Aids Profit LevelsThe partnership is currently focused on reducing costs and expenses  This is expected to benefit its bottom line  It has managed to significantly reduce costs and expenses in the last few quarters  Total cost of sales and operating expenses declined 11 6  and 9 6  sequentially in fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019  respectively  The trend is expected to continue  thereby helping the partnership in increasing profit levels in the coming quarters Notably  Sunoco beat estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters  with average positive surprise of 29 73   Per the Zacks model  the partnership expects year over year growth of 100  in 2019 earnings Wrapping UpConsidering the above mentioned factors  Sunoco   being one of the largest motor fuel distributors in the wholesale market in terms of volume   is likely to maintain share price momentum  While the partnership has not hiked distribution since mid 2016  Sunoco boasts a double digit yield of 10 19   higher than the industry s 8 7  However  one red flag that investors have to watch out for is the partnership s high leverage ratio of more than 79   While divestment and cost curtailment initiatives have shored up the balance sheet to some extent  the partnership still carries a considerable long term debt of  2 3 billion Nevertheless  we believe that strategic buyouts to boost the core fuel distribution business  and increasing consumption of gasoline and diesel will help the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  partnership to tide over the challenges and drive its performance further  You can see  Other Refining and Marketing MLPs to ConsiderOther top ranked stocks in the same space include Calumet Specialty Products Partners  L P    NASDAQ CLMT    NGL Energy Partners LP   NYSE NGL   and Western Gas Equity Partners  LP   NYSE WES    While Calumet sports a Zacks Rank  1
