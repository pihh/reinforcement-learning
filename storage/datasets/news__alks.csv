116241,337756,ALKS,5 Beaten Down Biotech Stocks Set To Rebound In 2020,opinion,The Zacks industry is up 8 6  this year so far compared with the S P 500 s increase of 26 1  The industry includes large as well as small biotech companies  which are much riskier investment bets than drug companies that make specialty medicines  Though this industry includes big biotechs like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Gilead  NASDAQ GILD   Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  and Regeneron among others  it mostly comprises small biotech companies that have a small portfolio of marketed drugs or even no commercial stage drugs at all  Some of these clinical stage drugmakers are dependent on just one pipeline candidate  Thus  the success or failure of their key pipeline candidates in clinical studies can significantly drive the stock s price and also the entire industry s stock market performance A partnership deal with a popular drug maker is a good sign about the potential of small pharma companies  especially when there is an equity investment included in the deal These smaller innovative companies  in general  had a better year than 2018  the primary reason being pivotal study successes involving key pipeline candidates  Other than that  frequent FDA approvals to innovative pipeline candidates gave a boost to the sector  Most importantly  there have been numerous M A activity and collaboration deals  which pushed up stock prices  Smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have garnered attention of bigger players this year  Oncology and gene therapy have mainly been the focus areas for M A activities The larger players like Amgen  Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Alexion  NASDAQ ALXN   and Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  also handily outperformed the industry as the factors driving these large cap companies are quite different  We believe that strong quarterly results  consistent increases in full year sales and earnings guidance  new product sales ramp up with rising demand  successful innovation and product line extensions  strong clinical study results  and frequent FDA approvals have helped these big biotech giants to consistently do well this year despite broader macro headwinds as well as the industry s own challenges The biotech sector is expected to continue to do well in 2020 as well  We believe that pipeline success  important advances in clinical studies  product launches  and ramped up M A and collaboration activities should keep the sector afloat  going forward in an aggressively competitive market Importantly  the Zacks Medical Biomedical and Genetics industry features among the top 22  of the 255 Zacks ranked industries Coming back to the smaller biotechs  though most stocks are up  there are several of them which have seen their share price drop this year  However  these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   and have seen positive estimate revisions in the past 60 days  which leads us to believe that these have the potential to bounce back in 2020  You can see  We discuss five such stocks here  A chart showing the share price movement of all the five stocks is given below   Alkermes   NASDAQ ALKS  Shares of Alkermes are down 30 4  this year so far  mainly due to FDA rejection of its new drug application   NDA   for ALKS 5461 early in the year due to lack of evidence supporting efficacy of the oral medication   The NDA sought approval of ALKS 5461 for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder   MDD   Nonetheless  the company recovered after the initial jolt  Sales of Alkermes  proprietary products  Vivitrol and Aristada  are strong while the upcoming launch of Vumerity  FDA approval in November 2019  will provide a profitable new source of royalty revenues from partner Biogen  Alkermes is also progressing well with its pipeline and submitted ALKS 3831 NDA for both schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder last month with a potential approval expected next year  Alkermes also announced a restructuring plan to reduce costs  better cost structure and to focus on growth opportunities  The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  1 and its estimates for 2020 have improved from a loss of 11 cents to earnings 59 cents in the past 60 days Innoviva  Inc    NASDAQ INVA  Innoviva s shares are down 19 4  this year so far mainly due to decline in royalty revenues from partner Glaxo on its Relvar Breo Ellipta products  Glaxo is seeing lower sales of Relvar Breo Ellipta products due to increased pricing discounts in the ICS LABA sector following the launch of generic versions of Glaxo s blockbuster medicine  AdvairHowever  sales of Glaxo s newest Ellipta product  Trelegy Ellipta  is rising  benefiting from share gains after an expanded U S  label  Innoviva s royalties on Trelegy Ellipta may increase in 2020  making up lower royalties on Relvar Breo  The company has a Zacks Rank of 1 and has seen positive estimate revision of 25  for 2020 over the past 60 days Retrophin  Inc    NASDAQ RTRX  This small San Diego  CA based biotech s stock is down 35 7  year to date mainly due to the failure of a late stage study on its lead pipeline candidate  fosmetpantotenate in patients with pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration  PKAN  a rare genetic neurological disorder  in August  The study failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints and Retrophin discontinued future development of the fosmetpantotenate program Nonetheless  Retrophin is progressing well on development of its other pipeline candidate  sparsentan  Enrolment continues in two pivotal studies to support potential registration of sparsentan in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  FSGS  andIgA nephropathy  IgAN   respectively  Meanwhile  the commercial launch for Thiola EC tablets  tiopronin  is underway following FDA approval for the treatment of cystinuria in June The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Loss estimates for 2020 have narrowed from  3 58 per share to  2 47 per share for 2020 in the past 60 days Autolus Therapeutics plc   NASDAQ AUTL  Autolus Therapeutics  stock is down 58 9  this year so far mainly on investor concerns about its cash burnAutolus Therapeutics  a London based small cancer biotech  however  has a Zacks Rank  2  Its loss estimates for 2020 have narrowed from  3 97 per share to  3 28 per share for 2020 in the past 60 days Autolus plans to initiate a pivotal study on its CD19 targeting CAR T cell therapy  AUTO1 in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  with first patient dosing scheduled for the first half of 2020  Autolus presented strong efficacy and safety data on AUTO1 at ASH this year  It also has AUTO3  a dual CD19 and CD22 targeting CAR T cell therapy  in development for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma  in its pipeline Atara Biotherapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ ATRA  Shares of this California based biotech  which makes treatments for patients with cancer  autoimmune  and viral diseases  has declined 55 8  this year so far  Slower than expected enrolment progress in phase III studies of its lead pipeline candidate  tabelecleucel  tab cel   and resultant postponement of regulatory filing on the candidate  to 2020 from the second half of 2019   mainly pushed shares down in the first half of the year However  Atara Biotherapeutics has a Zacks Rank  2  Its loss estimates for 2020 have narrowed from  5 39 per share to  4 76 per share for 2020 in the past 60 days It is progressing well on its innovative off the shelf  allogeneic T cell immunotherapy pipeline programs  specifically tab cel  ATA188  ATA2271 ATA3271 and ATA3219  Investor optimism around the success of the ongoing phase III trials with tab cel in Epstein Barr virus associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disease  EBV  PTLD  is high  The company is on track to file a biologics license application for tab cel in EBV  PTLD in the second half of 2020 Zacks

116242,337757,ALKS,5 Losing Stocks From 2019 To Rebound Next Year,opinion,After struggling in 2018  wherein all three major indexes   the Dow Jones Industrial Average  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite   finished in the red  U S  stocks rebounded brilliantly in 2019  which is in its last leg  In fact  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite touched new highs on multiple occasions this year  and are poised to end 2019 on a healthy note  Notably  the S P 500 hit the 3 000 level for the first time in its history this July The fact that 2019 has been an extremely rewarding year so far for Wall Street can be gauged from the fact that the tech heavy Nasdaq  the S P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained 32 4   27 1  and 20 9   respectively  on a year to date basis  as of Dec 18  Given this rosy backdrop  let s delve deeper to unearth the reasons behind the U S  stocks  impressive performance  so far this year  after struggling in 2018 Wall Street had a tumultuous 2018 primarily due to trade fears  interest rate uncertainty and a partial government shutdown  However  2019 has largely seen positive developments on the trade front With the U S  stock market movement being predominantly based on trade related news rumors  the agreement between the United States and China regarding phase one of the trade deal  earlier this December  found huge favor with investors  although the nations are expected to sign the agreement only next January  The United States has agreed to ease tariffs for certain exports from China  The deal also includes China s commitment to purchase a significant amount of U S  farm  energy and manufactured goods  This development has given birth to hopes that the 17 month long standing trade war between the two largest economies in the world could finally come to an end Markets were also driven by the Federal Reserve s three interest rate cuts this year  The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate in July  September and October  in a bid to lay recession fears to rest  Following the successive rate cuts  it has become cheaper for customers to borrow money for buying cars and houses  and starting new businesses  The benchmark interest rates have currently been kept by the Fed in the 1 50 1 75  band Moreover  the U S  economy s steady expansion pace in 2019 has buoyed markets  The pace of U S  economic expansion picked up in the third quarter this year  Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  the economy grew at an annualized rate of 2 1  in the three month period ended Sep 30  higher than the initial estimate of 1 9  and the 2  pace in the second quarter Also  consumers remain confident about their well being  According to the University of Michigan s preliminary data  U S  consumer sentiment touched a  high In December Additionally  markets have been positively impacted this year  thanks to the easing of Brexit related uncertainties The upbeat sentiment witnessed by Wall Street in the current year will likely continue into the next year as well  Tailwinds like easing of trade war related uncertainties between the United States and China  possibility of the Fed not hiking interest rates  and more clarity on the Brexit front might result in stocks moving north in 2020 as well Some Faltering Stocks in 2019 Poised to Rebound Despite the overall bullish scenario  some stocks did not make hay in 2019  However  with Wall Street s impressive run this year  identifying stocks which failed to shine is not an easy task  To simplify the procedure  we have utilized the  to identify stocks with a price decline in excess of 20  so far this year  Additionally  these stocks have a market capitalization of more than  1 billion Furthermore

116275,337790,ALKS,These 5 Loser Stocks Of 2019 Could Be Big Winners In 2020,opinion,Wall Street has had an impressive run in 2019  with all major market indexes racking up handsome returns year to date  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have struck new highs on a record number of occasions and look to be on course to finish the year on a strong note While equities tumbled early this month on news that President Donald Trump is expected to delay any U S  China trade deal until after the 2020 presidential elections and weak U S  manufacturing numbers  blockbuster U S  job data in the form of a robust November s non farm payrolls report provided a thrust to the stock markets Moreover  U S  indexes soared last Thursday with all three rocketing to record highs on news that Washington and Beijing are closing in on an initial trade deal  A decisive electoral win for British prime minister Boris Johnson in the U K  general elections also triggered the rally  The victory clears the path for Brexit Indexes further cruised last Friday to fresh highs after the United States and China agreed to a phase one trade deal after months of negotiation on its terms  The deal averted the implementation of a new round of U S  tariffs on around  160 billion of consumer goods from China including popular consumer products like smartphones  which were slated to kick in on Dec 15  China has also reportedly suspended its additional tariffs on U S  goods that were supposed to take effect that same day Moreover  the United States will also slash its 15  tariff on about  120 billion of Chinese imports to 7 5   the U S  Trade Representative  Robert Lighthizer said on Friday  However  the existing 25  tariff will remain in place on about  250 billion worth of goods from China  The deal  which is expected to be signed in early January  also includes China s commitment to purchase a significant amount of U S  farm  energy and manufactured goods President Trump also said that the parties will start negotiation on the  Phase Two  deal immediately rather than waiting until after the 2020 elections  After an initial rally on the news of the deal  major indexes pared early gains due to lack of clarity on details The partial trade deal and more certainty surrounding Brexit post U K  election results removes  at least for now  two major stumbling blocks that have largely constrained the global economy this year After a Spooky 2018  Indexes Look Set for a Strong FinishThe Dow Jones  which touched an intraday all time high of 28 290 73 last Friday  has rallied around 21  year to date  as of Dec 13   The index has set multiple record closes so far this year The S P 500 has also shined this year after a gloomy 2018  in which  it lost around 6   The benchmark scaled a record high of 3 168 80 at closing on Dec 13  The S P 500  which has gained from better than expected corporate earnings  optimism on the trade front and the U S  Federal Reserve s dovish approach this year  is now up roughly 26  this year Meanwhile  the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is also up 31  for the year  The index touched an all time high of 8 734 88 at closing last Friday This is a remarkable performance after the roller coaster ride in 2018 when all three indexes finished in the negative territory  partly triggered by widespread concerns of an economic slowdown U S  Economy on Firm FootingThe U S  economy has shrugged off recession fears and remains fundamentally stable  With rising consumer confidence  gradual wage growth and unemployment level at five decade lows  the economy looks well set for 2020 and so do the stock markets Moreover  investors were cheered by the U S  Federal Reserve s three interest rate cuts this year in a bid to protect the American economy amid the hot and cold U S  China trade war and global slowdown The Fed cut its benchmark rates for the third time in 2019 in October  The Federal Open Market Committee lowered the benchmark fund rate by 25 basis points to 1 5 1 75   As widely expected by investors  the central bank kept interest rates unchanged in its December monetary policy meeting and signalled that it would leave rates on hold through next year  The Fed s move augurs well for consumer confidence and expansion of economic activities in 2020   A resilient American economy and a dovish Fed have been the key drivers of Wall Street this year  With economic data including employment surprisingly strong of late  the stock market rally will likely continue into the next year Trade Deal Augurs Well for World Economy  Equity MarketsUncertainties surrounding the U S  China trade tiff  concerns over slowing global economic growth  the Brexit impasse and other geopolitical concerns hurt the market on several occasions in 2019 and dragged down stocks across an array of industries The Trump administration s protectionist policies and bitter tariff war with China have largely contributed to the slowdown in the world economy  The trade war has led to a slowdown in global manufacturing activity  Trade frictions have also caused a slowdown in growth in China and Europe  and negatively impacted the automotive  technology  materials and industrial sectors The completion of the phase one deal should improve business sentiments and is expected to serve

of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Baidu  Inc    NASDAQ BIDU    Alkermes plc   NASDAQ ALKS    Commvault Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CVLT    Veoneer  Inc    NYSE VNE   and Zuora  Inc    NYSE ZUO   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog These 5 Loser Stocks of 2019 Could Be Big Winners in 2020Wall Street has had an impressive run in 2019  with all major market indexes racking up handsome returns year to date  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have struck new highs on a record number of occasions and look to be on course to finish the year on a strong note While equities tumbled early this month on news that President Donald Trump is expected to delay any U S  China trade deal until after the 2020 presidential elections and weak U S  manufacturing numbers  blockbuster U S  job data in the form of a robust November s non farm payrolls report provided a thrust to the stock markets Moreover  U S  indexes soared last Thursday with all three rocketing to record highs on news that Washington and Beijing are closing in on an initial trade deal  A decisive electoral win for British prime minister Boris Johnson in the U K  general elections also triggered the rally  The victory clears the path for Brexit Indexes further cruised last Friday to fresh highs after the United States and China agreed to a phase one trade deal after months of negotiation on its terms  The deal averted the implementation of a new round of U S  tariffs on around  160 billion of consumer goods from China including popular consumer products like smartphones  which were slated to kick in on Dec 15  China has also reportedly suspended its additional tariffs on U S  goods that were supposed to take effect that same day Moreover  the United States will also slash its 15  tariff on about  120 billion of Chinese imports to 7 5   the U S  Trade Representative  Robert Lighthizer said on Friday  However  the existing 25  tariff will remain in place on about  250 billion worth of goods from China  The deal  which is expected to be signed in early January  also includes China s commitment to purchase a significant amount of U S  farm  energy and manufactured goods President Trump also said that the parties will start negotiation on the  Phase Two  deal immediately rather than waiting until after the 2020 elections  After an initial rally on the news of the deal  major indexes pared early gains due to lack of clarity on details The partial trade deal and more certainty surrounding Brexit post U K  election results removes  at least for now  two major stumbling blocks that have largely constrained the global economy this year After a Spooky 2018  Indexes Look Set for a Strong FinishThe Dow Jones  which touched an intraday all time high of 28 290 73 last Friday  has rallied around 21  year to date  as of Dec 13   The index has set multiple record closes so far this year The S P 500 has also shined this year after a gloomy 2018  in which  it lost around 6   The benchmark scaled a record high of 3 168 80 at closing on Dec 13  The S P 500  which has gained from better than expected corporate earnings  optimism on the trade front and the U S  Federal Reserve s dovish approach this year  is now up roughly 26  this year Meanwhile  the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is also up 31  for the year  The index touched an all time high of 8 734 88 at closing last Friday This is a remarkable performance after the roller coaster ride in 2018 when all three indexes finished in the negative territory  partly triggered by widespread concerns of an economic slowdown U S  Economy on Firm FootingThe U S  economy has shrugged off recession fears and remains fundamentally stable  With rising consumer confidence  gradual wage growth and unemployment level at five decade lows  the economy looks well set for 2020 and so do the stock markets Moreover  investors were cheered by the U S  Federal Reserve s three interest rate cuts this year in a bid to protect the American economy amid the hot and cold U S  China trade war and global slowdown The Fed cut its benchmark rates for the third time in 2019 in October  The Federal Open Market Committee lowered the benchmark fund rate by 25 basis points to 1 5 1 75   As widely expected by investors  the central bank kept interest rates unchanged in its December monetary policy meeting and signaled that it would leave rates on hold through next year  The Fed s move augurs well for consumer confidence and expansion of economic activities in 2020   A resilient American economy and a dovish Fed have been the key drivers of Wall Street this year  With economic data including employment surprisingly strong of late  the stock market rally will likely continue into the next year Trade Deal Augurs Well for World Economy  Equity MarketsUncertainties surrounding the U S  China trade tiff  concerns over slowing global economic growth  the Brexit impasse and other geopolitical concerns hurt the market on several occasions in 2019 and dragged down stocks across an array of industries The Trump administration s protectionist policies and bitter tariff war with China have largely contributed to the slowdown in the world economy  The trade war has led to a slowdown in global manufacturing activity  Trade frictions have also caused a slowdown in growth in China and Europe  and negatively impacted the automotive  technology  materials and industrial sectors The completion of the phase one deal should improve business sentiments and is expected to serve as a fundamental catalyst for global markets moving into 2020  The deal is expected to nudge the equity markets higher and would better place the global economy for growth next year The deal removes a major overhang for investors and should allow them to breathe a bit easier going forward  It should also usher in a better business environment for American companies and spur economic growth 5 Beaten Down Stocks Likely to Make a Comeback

The proposed indication for tazemetostat  to be discussed at this upcoming ODAC meeting  is metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for curative surgery 
In July  the FDA accepted for filing the NDA for tazemetostat for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for curative surgery with Priority Review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  action date of Jan 23  2020  The NDA was based primarily on data from the 62 patient epithelioid sarcoma cohort of its ongoing phase II study on tazemetostat

Although the FDA will consider the recommendation of the panel  it is not bound by it 
A potential approval of the candidate will be a significant boost for this late stage biopharmaceutical company  which has limited candidates in its pipeline 
Shares of the company have skyrocketed 155 8  year to date compared with the  s growth of 4 6

116350,337865,ALKS,Check 5 Best Liquid Stocks For Impressive Returns,opinion,Liquidity of a stock is an important yardstick that many investors tend to ignore  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents  Liquid stocks have always been in demand owing to their potential for providing significant returns However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity for identifying potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks Current Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot  we have added asset utilization  which is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  as one of the screening criteria  Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  Though this ratio varies across industries  companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential  we have added our proprietary  to the screen Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3  While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency  Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency  Zacks Rank equal to  1  Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through   You can see  Growth Score less than or equal to B  Back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 handily beat other stocks  These criteria have narrowed down the universe of more than 7 700 stocks to only 12 Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the

Notably  the adjusted figure excludes one time items  depreciation   amortization expenses  interest expenses  and income tax benefit  Including all these items  the company incurred a loss of  1 70 per share compared with a loss of  1 15 in the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of  1 34

Operating Expenses
Adjusted research and development  R D  expenses totaled  110 5 million in the third quarter  up 72 1  year over year  The increase was primarily due to the ramp up of manufacturing activities for micro dystrophin program  partially offset by lower cost due to winding down of activities on the Utrophin platform by Sarepta s partner  Summit 
Adjusted selling  general   administrative  SG A  expenses were  59 6 million  up 40 2  year over year  Higher costs related to the global commercial expansion of its products and increased personnel expenses increased SG A expenses 
Sarepta s cost of sales was also higher  reflecting higher product costs due to rising demand for Exondys 51  Royalty payments to BioMarin   NASDAQ BMRN   per the terms of the 2017 settlement and license agreements related to the latter s exon skipping technology used in DMD therapies also drove cost of sales 
Pipeline Update
In August  the FDA  a complete response letter   CRL   to the new drug application   NDA   seeking accelerated approval for its most advanced DMD candidate  golodirsen  The regulatory authority cited two concerns   the risk of infections related to intravenous infusion ports and renal toxicity seen in pre clinical models  Sarepta is working with the FDA to address the issues raised in the CRL and find a path to get the candidate approved as early as possible 
Moreover  Sarepta stated on its third quarter earnings call that it will submit a NDA for its second DMD candidate  casimersen  after getting clarity on golodirsen NDA 
Meanwhile  the company is conducting a phase II study   MOMENTUM   on its next generation PPMO platform candidate  SRP 5051  in DMD patient amenable to exon 51 skipping  an indication similar to Exondys 51

fell to 5 9   The metric was last around this level in 2008  just before Ireland s economic crisis The jobless rate has been on a steady decline since the country s finance department projected in April that by the next year  the Irish economy would witness the unemployment rate falling to as low as 5 3   The body also stated that after this  joblessness would hold steady at that level till 2020  while the economy makes its way to full employment Coming to the statistics  the seasonally adjusted rate for the current level of unemployment fell even below the revised rate of 6  in the month before and 6 8  in April last year  The total number of persons who were left unemployed within Ireland stood at 140 300  lower than 143 500 persons in the month earlier  Also  in the past 12 months  16 700 persons got jobs Irish Manufacturing Activity Gains TractionManufacturing activity in the European country gained momentum in April after a period of lull in March due to weather related disruptions  Last month  a snowstorm in Ireland   the ugliest in last 36 years   forced the closure of business activity across the country  This led to Purchasing Managers  Index falling to 54 1  in March  its 12 month low However  post resumption of business in the country in April  the Investec factory Purchasing Managers  Index surged to 55 3   Further  business conditions within the Irish economy have steadily improved for the last 59 months  A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion EU Raises Its Growth Forecast on IrelandIn its Spring 2018 European Economic Forecast  the European Union  EU  raised its growth forecast for the Irish economy  The body stated that the country would continue to experience strong GDP growth in the next two years The commission remained upbeat on the prospects of the Irish economy and forecast that in 2018  Ireland s GDP will surge 5 7  and 4 1  in 2019  Such growth would be achieved on the back of a rise in household spending boosted by an increase in wages  Further  continued investment in construction would also ensure that the economy remains robust in the years to come  Rising employment would drive wages higher and low levels of inflation would boost consumer spending 4 Best ChoicesIreland s unemployment rate has fallen to a 10 year low even as the economy keeps growing consistently  This indicates that the country would remain EU s fastest growing economy for some time to come  Further  manufacturing activity in the country has also gathered steam in the last month  Finally  business conditions have kept on improving for almost 60 months on the trot  Such favorable conditions make Ireland s stocks a hotbed for money In this context  we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from

The global NOVA study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tysabri with every six week dosing routine compared with the standard interval dosing  SID  in patients with relapsing MS  The primary endpoint of the open label two year study is to check the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at week 48 
The NOVA analysis was initiated following an examination  which showed that the every six week dosing regimen of Tysabri led to a significant reduction in the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  PML   a serious brain infection  As a result  this study will now further assess the drug s benefit risk profile in the given dosing regimen 
Shares of Biogen have lost 10 4  in the past year  narrower than the  decrease of 24 2  

 
Apart from Tysabri  Biogen has several MS products in its portfolio including Avonex  Tecfidera and Plegridy  Tysabri is available in more than 80 countries across the planet  However  the drug s sales have not been encouraging of late due to the launch of Roche s   OTC RHHBY   Ocrevus  ocrelizumab   which was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS  RMS  and primary progressive MS  PPMS  in March 2017  Although Ocrevus gives strong competition to Biogen s MS drugs  the latter receives royalties on U S  sales of the former

116488,338003,ALKS,Alkermes Sinks As FDA Refuses Depression Drug Review ,opinion,"Shares of Alkermes Plc    NASDAQ ALKS   declined by more than 21  when the FDA refused to review its depression candidate  ALKS 5461  stating that the new drug application  NDA  did not have enough evidence for the oral medication to work  Importantly  the FDA suggested that additional studies might be required to demonstrate the drug s overall effectiveness for the proposed indication 
ALKS 5461  for a once daily oral medication has been developed for the adjunctivetreatment of major depressive disorder  MDD  in patients who have not responded well to standard antidepressant therapies  The NDA for the candidate was filed in January 2018  Notably  ALKS 5461 is a fixed dose combination of buprenorphine  a partial mu opioid receptor agonist and kappa opioid receptor antagonist  and samidorphan  a mu opioid receptor antagonist 
Per the FDA  information submitted in the NDA provided insufficient evidence of ALKS 5461 s overall effectiveness for MDD  The FDA has asked Alkermes to conduct a new set of studies before it resubmitted the NDA  Specifically  the regulatory body requested the company to conduct a bioavailability study for more bridging data between 5461 and the reference drug  buprenorphine 
Alkermes  however  is disappointed with the FDA s decision and plans to appeal the same  In fact  the company intends to seek immediate guidance  including request a Type A meeting with the FDA  in order to find out what additional information might be needed to file a revised NDA 
Per Alkermes  the NDA submission was supported by encouraging efficacy and safety data package from more than 30 studies conducted on more than 1 500 patients with the aforementioned indication  The company is confident that ALKS 5461 has demonstrated antidepressant activity  safety and tolerability across all development programs 
Additionally  Alkermes is of the view that around 17 million people are annually diagnosed with MDD in the United States of which  a large number does not get sufficient relief from the first line standard antidepressant therapy  Therefore  approval of this drug will provide the company with an access to a huge patient population base looking for new treatment options  The company also announced its plans to evaluate how the setback might impact Alkermes  previously anticipated financial guidance for 2018 Alkermes plc Price

XOMA Corporation   NASDAQ XOMA    XOMA is focused on the discovery  development and licensing of therapeutic antibodies  The company has several licensing agreements with other biotech and pharma companies which provide it with funds in the form of upfront and milestone payments and potential royalty payments  XOMA s shares have been on an upward trajectory from August following the signing of licensing agreements with Novartis   NYSE NVS   for gevokizumab and intellectual property covering the use of IL 1 beta targeting antibodies in the treatment of cardiovascular disease  This deal resulted in XOMA receiving upfront payments including an equity investment  The agreement terms also resulted in a 50  reduction in XOMA s outstanding debt through the repayment of its  12 million obligation to Les Laboratoires Servier and the extension of the company s maturity date for its debt to Novartis by a couple of years  XOMA also stands to earn significant milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales of gevokizumab  Additional such licensing deals for the rest of the pipeline would be a major boost for the stock  which has seen its shares soar 587 9  over the past year Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 loss has been lowered 57 6  over the last 30 days  XOMA is a Zacks Rank  1 stock   you can see   XOMA has an Earnings ESP of  10 68  for the fourth quarter of 2017

116562,338077,ALKS,3 Biotech Stocks Start Healthy In  18  Will The Rally Last ,opinion,"In 2018  the biotech industry is expected to witness a continuation of last year s favorable trends  Last year  the industry benefited from a number of FDA approvals  new product sales ramp up  R D success and innovation  strong clinical study results and continued strength in some legacy products  There were some first time approvals for innovative game changing treatment options 
Noteworthy among them was the approval of Novartis    NYSE NVS   Kymriah  the first cell based gene therapy known as CAR T therapy  which is an innovative treatment option for cancer  This was followed by another CAR T approval  that of Kite Pharma s Yescarta  Spark Therapeutics s Luxturna  the first gene therapy to treat a rare  inherited form of childhood blindness  was also approved last year 
The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 17 8  in 2017  Moreover  the  industry increased 2 8  in the same time frame 
Though pricing pressure  rising competition  pipeline setbacks  slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs are some of the headwinds  the above mentioned factors should continue contributing to the sector s growth in 2018 
In December  the tax overhaul was signed into law  slashing corporate tax rates from 35  to 21  which can boost profits of large drug biotech companies  Meanwhile  the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one time tax rate of 10  
Also  the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions  which were rampant in the drug industry  These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug biotech companies  The cash can be invested for mergers acquisitions  which have been few in 2017 
With this bullish outlook for the sector  we look at three biotech stocks that have seen their share price rise more than 5  this year so far and look well positioned for the rest of 2018  All the three stocks have witnessed upward estimate revisions and have a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy

Key events lined up for the year include FDA s review of ALKS 546 s  new drug application  NDA  for the treatment of major depressive disorder  the phase III data readout for ALKS 3831 in schizophrenia  the NDA filing for ALKS 8700 in the first half of 2018  which is being evaluated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  The company could also gain FDA approval for new initiation product of Aristada  Aripiprazole Lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion   for the treatment of schizophrenia  by Jun 30  
Alkermes  a Zacks Rank  2 stock  has seen its shares gain 7 3  year to date compared with the 2 4  rally of the  it belongs to  You can see   The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 50  upward over the last 30 days 

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ VRTX    Vertexsports a Zacks Rank  1  Its earnings per share estimates for 2018 have moved up 2 8  in the last 30 days  The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters  with an average beat of 32 67   Share price of the company has increased 5 4  year to date 

Year 2017 was a tremendous year for Vertex with positive data read outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two cystic fibrosis  CF  products   Kalydeco   Orkambi  The trend continues in 2018 with Orkambi getting EU approval for pediatric use 
With a consistent expansion in patient population  Vertex s CF product revenues increased through 2017  The company is optimistic that the positive trend in CF sales will continue in 2018 on additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex U S  markets and approval to launch tezacaftor  VX 661  ivacaftor combination medicine 
Vertex s CF pipeline is also quite strong with a broad portfolio of next generation CF correctors  Vertex also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies in 2017 and has meaningful pipeline catalysts  Investor focus is on triple combination CF regimens  which are crucial for long term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90  of CF patients  Vertex plans to initiatepivotal phase III studies on up to two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018 
Agenus Inc    NASDAQ AGEN    Agenuscarries a Zacks Rank  2  Loss estimates for the company narrowed by 0 7  for 2018 in the last 30 days  Share price of the company has increased 18 7  year to date 

 
Agenus has formed collaborations with Merck   NYSE MRK   and Incyte to discover and develop multiple checkpoint antibodies 
In October 2017  the FDA granted marketing authorization to GlaxoSmithKline s   NYSE GSK   herpes zoster vaccine  Shingrix  which contains Agenus  proprietary immune adjuvant QS 21 Stimulon  This is good news for Agenus as Shingrix has a blockbuster potential and an increase in its sales will impact the business of Agenus positively   
Earlier this month  the company announced a  230 million non dilutive royalty financing transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners  HCR  which will significantly boost its cash position  Agenus will use part of these proceeds to redeem its royalty bond from Oberland and to fund its pivotal pipeline programs  The company also announced new leadership appointments to enhance its team and advance ongoing pivotal programs with CTLA 4 and PD 1 which will support its planned BLA filings in the second half of 2019 and in 2020

116588,338103,ALKS,21st Century Cures Act Hopes To Reduce  41 Billion Annual Cost Of Opioid,opinion,"The signing last month of the 21st Century Cures Act by President Barack Obama into a law signals a major revamp in the treatment of opioid addiction because of the promise of  1 billion in research funding  as well as a system to hasten approval of drugs and medicine devices by the Food and Drug Administration 
In all  the Act pledges  6 3 billion in fresh funding over the next two years to fast track regulatory review with the aim of bringing drugs and medicines to the market faster  The new funds are expected to create major changes in the pharmaceuticals and medical device industries 
The signing of the Act quickly drew positive response from the Coalition to Stop Opioid Overdose  the eminent lobby group in the fight against opioid abuse  which welcomed the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act 
The group said in a statement   This legislation can help create real change for the millions of Americans impacted by the opioid crisis  In addition to the passage of this bill  we are calling for the upcoming continuing resolution to include a provision to immediately start the flow of these funds into communities across America  
Opioid Crisis in the U S    Brady Granier  President  CEO and Director of Biocorrx Inc  OTC BICX   said that the opioid epidemic affects millions of Americans  Independent data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDCP  showed that over 33 000 Americans lost their lives from opioid overdose in 2015  In that same year  the number of persons who have died due to heroin overdoses surpassed those who were killed due to gun homicides  the first in U S  history     It s a sad reality  Many lives are being lost because of this opioid epidemic that is showing no signs of slowing  There are many factors contributing to this crisis and there is no single solution   Granier said   More resources need to be focused on prevention and treatment  There are some very encouraging new tools being used on the treatment side that should be getting more recognition than they are currently  I think that will change soon as the treatment industry is rapidly evolving into more evidence based treatment  
Addiction treatment has an annual market size of  41 billion in the U S  with more than 23 million Americans addicted to alcohol and drugs  Of these only 12  receive addiction treatment  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA  and the National Institute on Drug Abuse  NIDA  estimate it costs the U S  more than  600 billion every year due to health care  law implementation enforcement  sponsored treatment  and counteractive action endeavors 
Indeed  the treatment for opioid addiction is not cheap  In fact  the price of opioid overdose antidote and treatment are rising at an alarming rate 
Price of Narcan and Anti Opioid Drugs on The Rise
First responders usually administer naloxone  more commonly known by its brand name Narcan  as an opioid overdose antidote naloxone  But as the number of cases of opioid overdoses increase  the price of the drug multiplies 
Brandon Heard  chief of Farmington fire department captain in New Mexico  commented in CNBC   I ve seen the price of Narcan as well as epinephrine just skyrocket   He added   It makes it difficult for us as a municipality to purchase the same medications and provide the same treatment and abilities that we have in years past  
Although naloxone now comes in a generic form  big pharmaceutical companies still jack up the prices  Hospira  a generic naloxone manufactured by Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   now costs  15 per milliliter from less than  1 in 2005  The newer delivery method of the drug ranges between  125 and  3 750 for two doses 
Another opioid addiction treatment drug available in the market is the injectable naltrexone  currently exclusively manufactured by Alkermes Plc  NASDAQ ALKS   a  9 billion pharmaceutical company which sells the drug under its brand name Vivitrol  The cost of one Vivitrol injection is  1 300 
New And Cheaper Opioid and Alcohol Addiction Treatment
But less expensive opioid and alcohol addiction treatment options may be are coming soon  BioCorRx  an addiction treatment solutions company  is developing a newer form of injectable naltrexone that is expected to cost less than the leading Vivitrol brand and perhaps even less painful when administered  BioCorRx s injectable naltrexone product in development  BICX101 is expected to last over 30 days  Naltrexone can reduce cravings for alcohol and opioids  but can also block the effects of opioids and the euphoric effects of consuming alcohol 
 Vivitrol was expected to generate  180    200 million in revenue for 2016  and  220 million for 2017  It seems their dominance may be poised for disruption should BioCorRx prevail with BICX101  BioCorRx has stated that they expect to be able to file a 505 b  2  application with the FDA for approval of BICX101  This sort of application is generally regarded as a fast track to approval  BioCorRx hopes to be able to submit a NDA by 2018 and begin generating sales in 2019  
Last year  BioCorRx announced an initial investment of  2 5 million with an additional option of  2 5 million from private equity firm Alpine Creek Capital  This is the single largest investment made in the company thus far  which Granier views as a strong indicator of the investment merits of the business given the intense due diligence performed by a firm such as Alpine Creek Capital 
Given BioCorRx s high growth two pronged growth strategy with centers and the new naltrexone injection in development  JGR Capital Partners recently initiated coverage on BioCorRx with an 18 month price target of  0 09 ",2017-01-21,James Sarmiento,https://www.investing.com/analysis/21st-century-cures-act-hopes-to-reduce-$41-billion-annual-cost-of-opioid-200173093,200173093
116589,338104,ALKS,Naloxone And Naltrexone  Anti Drug Addiction Stocks To Watch,opinion,"With the drug addiction treatment market being about  35 billion a year in the U S  alone  it is easy to understand why the industry is rapidly becoming a popular space 
Big pharmaceutical companies  like Insys Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ INSY   Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE   Amphastar P  NASDAQ AMPH   Mylan N V   NASDAQ MYL   Opiant Technologies Inc   OPNT   Adapt Pharma Ltd   Kaleo Pharmaceuticals  Alkermes Plc  NASDAQ ALKS   and newcomer Biocorrx Inc  OTC BICX  are all jockeying for position to get a bigger slice of the market 

Brady Granier  President  CEO and Director of BioCorRx  commented   This epidemic is showing no signs of slowing and more options are needed for treatment and prevention  It is a very large market that is showing some signs of consolidation within the treatment center space  We are seeing an increase in traditional programs making a shift towards medication assisted treatment  MAT   One of the big three medications used in MAT is naltrexone  Many of these traditional programs are beginning to use or endorse the use of naltrexone because of its non addictive nature  It s an effective medication that should be getting as much attention as that of naloxone 

Anti Drug Addiction Market is a Rapidly Growing Industry
The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approved Adapt Pharma Ltd  s NARCAN Nasal Spray formulation in November 2015  Adapt Pharma has signed a licensing deal with Opiant Pharmaceuticals   OTC OPNT   formerly Lightlake Therapeutics  to use its intranasal opioid antagonist platform technology in the development of the NARCAN Nasal Spray  The deal could earn Opiant up to  55 million in milestone payments aside from double digit percentage royalties from Adapt on NARCAN Nasal Spray sales 
However  Adapt is not the only pharmaceutical company selling NARCAN as an anti overdose medication  Pfizer s subsidiary  Hospira  and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals are pioneers in injectable naloxone  These two companies are  in fact  being blamed for the sudden rise in the price of naloxone 
In its latest filing  Amphastar said that naloxone accounted for  38 6 million of the firm s  251 5 million revenue in 2015  and expects the numbers to rise further as the price of the medication increases  It added that it is currently working on the development of a naloxone nasal spray 
For its part  Kaleo Pharmaceuticals is marketing a naloxone auto injector under the Evzio brand name at about  700  800 per dose  Biotech giant  Mylan Inc  NASDAQ MYL   has started selling a naloxone injectable after receiving FDA approval in 2014  Troubled company  INSYS Therapeutics  is hoping to revive its stock price after getting a naloxone candidate assigned by the FDA as fast track eligible 
Alkermes Plc  NASDAQ ALKS   a  8 3 billion pharmaceutical company  is offering an injectable naltrexone which is used to block the effects of opioids  at a cost of  1 300 per shot under its Vivitrol brand name  Vivitrol sales reached  55 8 million in the first three quarters of 2016  Alkermes is projecting that the sales of Vivitrol could reach a billion dollar status in the near future and is looking to reach between  700 million and  800 million sales by 2018 
Last month  Biocorrx Inc  OTC BICX  announced it would be working with Innovative Science Solutions to assist the company with regulatory matters for the release of its naltrexone injectable product  BICX101  and one or more other naltrexone formularies  BICX101 is currently in preclinical development under BioCorRx s pharmaceutical subsidiary  in partnership with TheraKine 
BioCorRx s partnership with Innovative Science Solutions makes its hope of an FDA approval for BICX101 more likely 
Naloxone vs Naltrexone
In the fight against drug addiction  what is the difference between naloxone and naltrexone 
The FDA approved naloxone as a generic drug in 1971  It is often used by first responders and police officers to reverse opioid overdose in an acute situation  Naloxone is being sold as an over the counter drug and is sold without a prescription in some states  It can save lives once administered when someone is suspected of overdosing  but it only lasts a short time and the person then needs to be rushed to the hospital for observation  It s used for overdose and not for long term addiction treatment 
It s counterpart  naltrexone  is mainly used to reduce cravings and for relapse prevention  If one has therapeutic levels of naltrexone in their system  they can be protected from overdosing as the naltrexone blocks the opioids from binding with the receptors in the brain  BioCorRx is in early stages of development for a new injectable naltrexone called BICX101 

Granier explained   We believe that any form of sustained release naltrexone is of great benefit in preventing relapse and overdose and the more options we have  the better  BICX101 is being developed with the goal of improving patient compliance by reducing dose volume  needle size  and many other factors which can make compliance with other products more challenging

Alkermes reported positive top line data from the third phase III efficacy study  FORWARD 5  evaluating ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder  MDD  in patients who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies On the basis of FORWARD 5 study data as well as a considerable amount of data collected to date on the efficacy and safety of ALKS 5461 for the treatment of MDD  the company plans to request a meeting with the FDA s Division of Psychiatric Products on the regulatory path ahead for the candidate  The meeting is anticipated in the first quarter of 2017 Meanwhile  a supplemental new drug application for a two month dosing interval of Aristada is currently under FDA review  A response from the agency is expected in Jun 2017 ALKERMES INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Our TakeAlkermes  third quarter results were disappointing with the company missing top line estimates  even though the quarterly loss was in line with expectations  The company s royalty and manufacturing business recorded a year over over decline  However  revenues were driven by encouraging performance of Vivitrol and Aristada  The company continues to view both Vivitrol and Aristada as long term growth drivers  While Vivitrol should benefit from the newly passed Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act  gaining reimbursement and access for Aristada should work well for the latter  Meanwhile  Alkermes has maintained its outlook for 2016 On the other hand  the company s progress with its pipeline is impressive  Going forward  focus should remain on the same as important updates are expected over the coming months Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderAlkermes is a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock  Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector

116627,338142,ALKS,U S  Prisons Experimenting With Alkermes  Injectable Naltrexone,opinion,"Prisons across the U S  are experimenting with injectable naltrexone as the preferred treatment against opioid addiction  especially amongst soon to be released inmates who are still struggling with drug or alcohol dependency 
Manufactured by  9 billion pharmaceutical company Alkermes Plc  NASDAQ ALKS   the  1 300 per shot Vivitrol is being hailed as a wonder drug in the treatment of opioid addiction  although critics are skeptical about the effectiveness of the drug 
But the West Virginia Division of Corrections is one of the U S  prison systems that believes in the effectiveness of Vivitrol so much so that it has incorporated a monthly injection of the drug to its soon to be released inmates to prevent the lingering effects of opioid drugs and block any cravings for alcohol or drugs 
According to a report by The Register Herald  Debbie Hissom  Director of Medical Services at the Division of Corrections  said that since the program was initiated in July 2015  a total of 47 inmates have participated in the program  Hissom said that parole officers of participants who have been paroled have been reporting positive feedbacks about the progress of the participants  Hissom commented 

I think anything we can do is positive   Of course  it s not a 100 percent success rate  It is voluntary  and lots choose not to enroll  Some start and only get one or two injections 

The New Hampshire State Prison is already offering Vivitrol to its inmates  but the program is only available to individuals who have completed their sentences and ready for release 
Strafford County s George Maglaras said that the Strafford County House of Corrections is also seriously studying the prospect of instituting the use of Vivitrol with its inmates as part of a larger federal initiative to address the physical and behavioral health care of detainees in the county 
Sales of Vivitrol to reach  200 million in 2016
Brady Granier  President  CEO and Director of BioCorRx Inc  OTC BICX   an addiction treatment company and a new player in the development of injectable naltrexone  has said 

Sustained release naltrexone holds so much promise in the fight against the opioid epidemic that the sales of Vivitrol is expected to exceed  200 million this year 

The opioid epidemic affects more than two million Americans and an estimated 15 percent of the U S  prison population  Ganier added that BioCorRx is seeking to approve a

more efficient delivery of naltrexone with the prospect of better patient adherence to monthly injections  as well as easier administration of the injection by healthcare providers

The strong demand for Vivitrol helped push Alkermes  earnings this year  In its third quarter financial report  Alkermes said Vivitrol s sales totaled  55 8 million in the first nine months of 2016  comprising a big chunk of the company s  180 2 million total revenues up to the last quarter  James Frates  Chief Financial Officer of Alkermes stated 

Our third quarter results demonstrate the value of our highly diversified commercial portfolio  and were driven by the strong growth of our proprietary products  Vivitrol and Aristada   As we approach year end  we remain well positioned to execute on our business strategy and are reiterating our 2016 financial expectations provided in July 

New Player   Earlier this year  BioCorRx  Inc  partnered with TheraKine  Ltd  to develop its new injectable naltrexone formulation  BICX101  Granier said that the company selected Covance as the Contract Research Organization  CRO  for nonclinical studies of BICX101 
BICX101 is expected to last over 30 days with serum naltrexone levels at or above 2 ng ml which has been proven to be effective in craving reduction of alcohol and opioids  as well as protect opioid users from overdose if they attempt to use while an adequate level of naltrexone is in their system  BioCorRx will request a pre IND meeting with the FDA and anticipates a meeting date sometime in Q1 2017 to present the data from the in vitro release and in vivo absorption studies 
Granier suggested that once released in the market  BICX101 could be less costly than the leading Vivitrol brand and may also be less painful when administered as reported by many doctors and patients  Granier stated 

we are very excited to move into this next stage of our new injectable formulation and very pleased to have selected Covance to conduct the extended release and absorption studies for BICX101  They are a top notch CRO and came highly recommended by our team of advisors  We look forward to completing the studies very early in the New Year so that we can present the data to the FDA in the pre IND meeting 
From what we have seen in the in vitro release lab studies thus far  we are very confident that we will have a very effective product to help fight this opioid epidemic and alcoholism problem  We are also ecstatic to have someone of the caliber of Dr  Bal Brar on the team to help guide us through the development and regulatory pathway  His wisdom and experience are invaluable to our company  and his excitement about the data he has seen thus far on BICX101 has added to our confidence in the prospect of successful commercialization ",2016-11-29,James Sarmiento,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-prisons-experimenting-with-injectable-naltrexone-to-treat-addiction-200167034,200167034
116634,338149,ALKS,5 Drug Stocks To Avoid As Trump Vows To Lower Drug Prices ,opinion,"For those who thought that the pharma biotech sector is in for an extraordinary run after Donald Trump s unexpected victory  his latest vow to crack down on excessive drug price hikes comes as a bolt from the blue 
This year has been fraught with headwinds for the pharma biotech sector  Global efforts toward health care cost containment created pricing pressure on drugs and market access  Notably  U S  health care reforms under  Obamacare   officially known as the Affordable Care Act  or ACA  significantly increased the number of patients in the Medicaid program  which offers drugs at substantial discounts 
In many markets outside the U S   government mandated pricing actions led to the lowering of generic and patented drug prices  These factors had a material adverse impact on the sales and profits of pharma companies 
Meanwhile  democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had pledged to find ways to curb rising drug prices and lower prescription drug costs for all Americans  As a result  Mylan Inc    NASDAQ MYL   drew immense flak for overpricing its popular allergy treatment  EpiPen  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc    NYSE VRX   was also hit hard by the pricing controversy  after its strategy of acquiring smaller companies and selling their drugs at higher prices became apparent  Many others like Horizon Pharma and Endo International would have been equally impacted if Clinton was elected and her proposal realized 
However  with Trump s victory last month  the pharma biotech industry saw a ray of hope  During his campaign  Trump was not as vocal as Clinton regarding drug pricing issues and the surging cost of treatments  It was naturally assumed that a Republican administration would be significantly lenient toward drug manufacturers  pricing practices 
Thus  November saw the pharma biotech stocks recover from the sharp selloff witnessed in the past one year  The Zacks classified Drugs industry gained 2  during the month  compared with a decline of 17 2  in the year to date period 
A similar trend was witnessed in the share price movement of companies like Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Merck  NYSE MRK   Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Bristol Myers  Endo and Regeneron  all of which were in the green after the elections despite a year to date decline for most 
Notably  Trump s publicly revealed intentions of dismantling and replacing Obamacare and freeing up cash currently held overseas for tax reasons made him immensely popular in the industry  However  he doesn t seem to like price hikes as much 
In a recent interview with Time magazine  the President elect clarified that he plans to lower drug prices  suggesting some stock analysts may have  misread his intentions  
This dealt a significant blow to the shares of almost all pharma biotech stocks on Wednesday  iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF   which had gained 9  on the day after the elections  was down almost 3 0  
Big names like Celgene  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB   Mylan and Vertex Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ VRTX  declined around 4   while Amgen  Regeneron  Bristol Myers and AbbVie  lost in the range of 1 3  
Steer Clear of These 5 Stocks
Although most pharma biotech stocks saw their share prices slipping yesterday  here are five stocks that should definitely be avoided for now 
Eli Lilly and Company   NYSE LLY  
Shares of the Indianapolis  IN based healthcare company dipped around 1  on Wednesday  Recently  the company s shares took a hit after its high profile investigational Alzheimer s disease drug  solanezumab  failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late stage study  The Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company has seen its share price tumble 20  so far this year and 9  post elections 

Mylan N V 
Shares of the generic focused pharmaceutical company crashed 3 8  on Wednesday  The company has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  as it continues to face headwinds related to the pricing of EpiPen  Its share price has slumped 36 2  so far this year and 7  post elections 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc 
Shares of this Zacks Rank  5 company dropped 3 5  on Wednesday  The specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons in recent times like the price hike of specialty drugs  erroneous financial reporting  and termination of important contracts  Valeant s share price has plunged 85 2  so far this year despite a turnaround post elections 

Alkermes plc   NASDAQ ALKS  
This Dublin  Ireland based biopharmaceutical company saw its shares fall 4 7  yesterday  The Zacks Rank  4 company s share price has tanked 30  year to date  even though the elections spurred a recovery 

Emergent BioSolutions Inc    NYSE EBS  
Shares of the Zacks Rank  5 company declined 4 5  on Wednesday  This specialty biopharmaceutical company s share price has plummeted 33 7  so far this year and 4 6  post elections 

You can see  
Conclusion
Irrespective of Trump s subsequent actions  pricing and affordability of prescription drugs will remain a topic of discussion among policymakers  the media and the general public  Thus  for obvious reasons  we expect continued volatility in this sector in 2017

116649,338164,ALKS,5 Biotech Stocks To Avoid After Monday s Slump,opinion,"The phenomenal run of biotech stocks was cut short on Monday after companies like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  and Celladon  NASDAQ CLDN  reported disappointing news on the development front  This led to a 4 1  decline in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index  Overall  the U S  stock market was down 
Biotech major  Amgen s shares fell 3 3  with the FDA raising concerns about the company s skin cancer drug  talimogene laherparepvec  in its briefing documents ahead of an FDA advisory panel meeting  In addition to questioning the overall benefit risk profile of the drug  the FDA said that the biologics license application cannot be considered for an accelerated review at this time 
Development related news holds a lot of importance for biotech companies especially those in the clinical stage  Considering how important these updates are  Celladon s shares plummeted 80 7  after the company s lead experimental gene therapy  Mydicar  failed to meet both its primary and secondary endpoints in a phase IIb study for advanced heart failure 
Meanwhile  Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  shares also saw some weakness with the company s first quarter 2015 earnings falling short of expectations 
The sector has been threatened by pricing pressure ever since Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX  struck an exclusive deal with AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  for its hepatitis C combo drug  Viekira Pak over Gilead s  NASDAQ GILD  Sovaldi and Harvoni  in exchange for a significant discount 
Moreover  the entry of the first biosimilar in the U S  is a looming threat to the sector  Sandoz   a Novartis company  NYSE NVS    gained FDA approval for Zarxio  a biosimilar version of Amgen s blockbuster drug  Neupogen  Several other companies including Hospira  NYSE HSP  are also looking to introduce biosimilars in the U S  Biosimilars are expected to directly affect the market for branded biotech drugs 
Meanwhile  the volatility in the sector is expected to continue with several companies yet to announce first quarter 2015 earnings  Additionally  events  panels and discussions  including updates on clinical trials  drug launches  partnerships and big time announcements are adding to the heat  So we believe it s wise to avoid some stocks post Monday s slump 
How to Pick 
Picking stocks to dump could be a tricky proposition given that there are so many to be avoided  However  with the assistance of our new style score system  one can locate stocks with a red flag 
Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space 
Under no circumstance should you buy a stock with a Zacks Rank  4 or  5 coupled with a low Growth Style Score of C  D or F  That means the A rated stocks are expected to outperform the B rated stocks  the B rated stocks are expected to outperform the C rated stocks  the C s are expected to outperform the D s  and the F s should underperform them all 
Here we have zeroed in on five stocks that are either a Zacks Rank  4 or  5 and have a low Growth Style Score 
Alkermes plc  NASDAQ ALKS 
Dublin  Ireland based Alkermes has a diversified product portfolio and a robust pipeline focusing on central nervous system disorders such as addiction  schizophrenia and depression  However  the company has had its share of pipeline setbacks including a decision to discontinue the development of ALKS 7106  pain  when it failed to meet the company s pre specified criteria to enter phase II studies  Alkermes  fourth quarter 2014 earnings also declined from the year ago period
