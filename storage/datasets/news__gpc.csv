earnings for the auto sector are projected to decline 10 5  year over year  per the latest  So what s up in the auto sector Challenges Galore in Auto Sector in Third QuarterAutomakers around the globe have been struggling with declining car sales amid economic slowdown concerns  This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter  Auto sales in China  the world s largest car market  continued to plunge during the quarter amid recession worries and trade war tensions that have been denting confidence of consumers and holding back manufacturers  Increasing popularity of ride sharing platforms are also likely to have weighed on car sales  Stricter emissions woes  and shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to have changed the sector s dynamics  Widespread usage of technology and rapid digitalization resulted in fundamental restructuring of the automotive market  This is likely to have increased the cost of manufacturing vehicles  which was passed on to consumers and dented demand  Meanwhile  technological complications call for high priced aftersales services  which may have created new opportunities for auto equipment manufacturers to capitalize on

and bolster dealer networks are likely to have positively impacted third quarter performance  The firm s initiatives to lower expenses are expected to have boosted margins in the quarter to be reported  However  softness in the U S  market and tariffs from the European Union and China on Harley Davidson motorbikes are likely to have dented sales volume and the top line in the third quarter

Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use

12121,233636,GPC,Genuine Parts  GPC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects Genuine Parts  GPC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 7  
Revenues are expected to be  5 03 billion  up 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 24  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts 
For Genuine Parts  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Genuine Parts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of  1 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 57  delivering a surprise of  5 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Genuine Parts appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/genuine-parts-gpc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200472299,200472299

12139,233654,GPC,Genuine Parts  GPC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Genuine Parts  GPC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 67 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5  
Revenues are expected to be  5 01 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts 
For Genuine Parts  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Genuine Parts will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of  1 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 28  delivering a surprise of  2 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Genuine Parts doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/genuine-parts-gpc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200438983,200438983

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Standard Motor Products is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Genuine Parts has a Zacks Rank of  4  Sell   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SMP likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than GPC has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
SMP currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 86  while GPC has a forward P E of 15 84  We also note that SMP has a PEG ratio of 1 35  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  GPC currently has a PEG ratio of 3 17 
Another notable valuation metric for SMP is its P B ratio of 2 09  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  GPC has a P B of 3 58 
Based on these metrics and many more  SMP holds a Value grade of B  while GPC has a Value grade of C

12183,233698,GPC,Top Stock Reports For Nike  3M   Vertex ,opinion,"Thursday  February 21  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Nike  NYSE NKE   3M  MMM  and Vertex  VRTX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked Nike s shares have gained  26 5  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry  which gained  19 9  over the same period  driven by a strong earnings trend stemming from the solid execution of Consumer Direct Offense  Nike has delivered positive earnings surprise for over three years now  with second quarter fiscal 2019 marking 26th straight quarter of earnings beat  
Moreover  sales topped estimates for the seventh straight quarter  The Zacks analyst thinks strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on direct to customer are the key drivers  Growth at international and Nike Direct businesses alongside momentum in North America also aided fiscal second quarter results  
Continued strength in Nike Digital is driving the top line  However  higher SG A expenses due to increased demand creation expense and operating overheads are likely to remain a drag  Further  the unfavorable currency environment due to the global trade and geopolitical dynamics is likely to weigh on the company s sales 
 You can   
Shares of 3M have lost  5  in the past three months  underperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has gained  8 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks 3M stands to gain from efforts to innovate products  solid demand and portfolio restructuring moves  Its acquisition of the technology business of M Modal is likely to strengthen the Health Information Systems business in the months ahead  
In the fourth quarter of 2018  the company s earnings and revenues surpassed estimates  However  on a year over year basis  net sales declined 0 6  due to the impact of divestiture and forex woes 
For 2019  the company lowered its earnings projection and net sales growth guidance  Foreign currency translation is predicted to adversely influence sales by 1   In addition  inflation in prices of major inputs and rising competitive pressures pose threats to near term profitability  Shares also look comparatively overvalued 
 You can   
Vertex s shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past year   19 2  vs   15 9    Vertex beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  The Zacks analyst likes Vertex s dominance in the CF market  A significant increase in the eligible patient population for its CF drugs is driving sales growth  
Vertex s third CF medicine  Symdeko  in a very short time  became the primary driver of the significant growth in CF revenues in 2018  Vertex s CF pipeline is also accelerating rapidly  Studies on Vertex s triple combination CF regimens are moving fast  The CF triple pill regimes are crucial for long term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90  of CF patients  
Meanwhile  Vertex s non CF pipeline  though early stage  looks interesting  However  competitive pressure is rising in the CF market with many other companies developing triple combo CF drugs  Also  Vertex s dependence on just the CF franchise for growth is a concern

12197,233712,GPC,Genuine Parts  GPC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Genuine Parts  GPC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 19  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 8  
Revenues are expected to be  4 58 billion  up 8 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts 
For Genuine Parts  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Genuine Parts will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of  1 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  0 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Genuine Parts doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/genuine-parts-gpc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200386938,200386938

12266,233781,GPC,Ubiquiti Networks  United Natural Foods  Ford Motor  Genuine Parts And Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 11  2019    Ubiquiti Networks   NASDAQ UBNT   as the Bull of the Day  United Natural Foods  Inc    NYSE F   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford Motor Company   NYSE F    Genuine Parts Company   NYSE GPC   and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N V    NYSE F  Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   Based in San Jose  California  Ubiquiti Networks is a company that designs  manufactures  and sells broadband wireless solutions worldwide  Its products and solutions include radios  antennas and management tools and other applications in the unlicensed radio frequency spectrum Impressive Q1 EarningsBack in November  Ubiquiti announced better than expected fiscal 2019 first quarter results  beating expectations for the third straight time thanks to its growing Enterprise Technology business Adjusted earnings of  1 17 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  net income was  86 2 million Gross margin hit 46 5   up from 45 4  in the year ago period Revenues of  283 million also beat our consensus estimate  and increased 15 1  year over year  Notably  enterprise technology segment revenue soared 41 3  to  177 9 million  and this includes the UniFi  mFi  and Ubiquiti s consumer centric AmpliFi and FrontRow products Looking at revenue by geography  North American revenue climbed 24 1  to  119 4 million while EMEA revenue increased 33 9  Management didn t hold a conference call with analysts  but stated again that gross margin is expected to decline to between 42  and 45  in the near term due to tariffs on products imported from China They did add that it expects  mitigating the effect of the tariffs in the long term and therefore our long term gross margins are expected to remain between 45  to 50   Over the past 12 months  UBNT has gained almost 43   And in the last six months  shares have jumped over 30  Estimates have been rising lately too  pushing the stock towards a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  For the current fiscal year  Ubiquiti s earnings are expected to grow around 11 7  year over year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved 24 cents higher in the past 60 days from  3 88 to  4 12 per share Next year looks pretty strong too  The consensus estimate sits at  4 29 per share  with two upward revisions in the last two months Bottom LineUbiquiti also reiterated its previous outlook for full year revenue between  1 1 billion to  1 2 billion  with EPS in the range of  4 00 to  4 80  Additional tariffs could drag full year earnings to  3 65 or lower  however But  given UBNT s strong stock performance during that volatile run recently from the broader market and other tech stocks  the company is on a good path going forward  and looks to continue its outperformance  For those investors looking for a technology stock to add to their portfolio  UBNT should definitely be on the shortlist   United Natural Foods  Inc  is a wholesale distributor to the natural  organic  and specialty industries in the United States and Canada  United Natural Foods serves a wide variety of sales channels including conventional supermarket chains  natural product superstores  independent retailers  eCommerce and food service Shares of United Natural Foods have slumped over 70  in the past six months  and mixed results in its first quarter earnings report left investors disappointed The company posted revenues of  2 87 billion  which did beat our consensus estimate  but earnings of 59 cents per share came in well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents per share Additionally  margins declined yet again  Gross margin of net saleswas 14 44  of net sales compared to 14 94  last year  This decline was due to a change in the way the company estimates liabilities associated with inventory purchases  but it was also driven by a shift in customer mix Operating income of  51 million fell from the year ago period and was affected by lower gross margins and higher labor costs The company recently closed on the previously announced acquisition of SUPERVALU  and in a press release  chairman and CEO Steve Spinner said that  The integration of the two companies is well under way and we continue to be excited about the long term creation of value for our shareholders we expect to deliver with this combination  Estimates are FallingIt didn t take long for analysts to lower their estimates for fiscal 2019  and seven have slashed their earnings outlook in the last 60 days  our consensus has been slashed by more than half from  3 32 to  1 76 per share  and earnings are expected to decline 43 4  for the year The consensus estimate has fallen for next fiscal year  too  down well over one dollar from  3 61 to  2 33 per share  Seven analysts have also cut their estimates for this time period as well UNFI is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Over the past year  United Natural Foods has struggled to improve margins as well as profitability  two factors that have really dampened shares  Unless the company can improve its bottom line  more quarters like Q1 may lie ahead Additional content  Ford to Ally with Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  to Cut Costs Ford Motor Company will reveal a closer collaboration with Volkswagen AG  which is expected to be announced next week  per Reuters  The alliance between the companies is anticipated to go beyond commercial vehicles  which will aid the companies to reduce mounting costs as they make new technological advancements  In September 2018  it was reported that Ford and Volkswagen were analyzing partnership options to grow their business and cut costs  Per the recent updates  the companies are about to announce their global partnership during the Detroit auto show  beginning next week  It has already been confirmed by these automakers that no probable merger or equity stake transaction will take place between the two  Ongoing trade disagreements and economic volatility compelled these automakers to reconsider vehicle manufacturing for the United States  China and Europe  High freight costs are adding to the automakers  woes  who are already struggling with high investment for developing latest technology to cater to evolving customer preferences  Further  cash rich companies launching their own autonomous cars are adding competitiveness in the market The framework of the coalition between Ford and Volkswagen will include autonomous technology  Volkswagen s investment in Ford  and Ford licensing Volkswagen s MEB electric vehicles platform  Discussions are still on to determine the scope of collaboration for electric and self driving car technology  Additionally  Volkswagen is expected to gain access to Ford s manufacturing hubs  and Transit commercial van and midsized pickup truck  Ranger   In the last week  many prominent automakers announced their U S  auto sales volume for 2018  During the year  Volkswagen s sales rose 4 2  year over year to 354 064 vehicles while Ford witnessed a decline of 3 5  to 2 5 million  The sales decline for Ford is partly due to dropping passenger car sales and lower than expected sales of SUVs  trucks  and vans  Apart from its struggling position in the United States  economic slowdown in China and Europe are other headwinds for Ford  For 2018  the company lowered its earnings guidance to  1 30  1 50 from  1 45  1 70 mentioned earlier  Dropping sales in China and Europe  along with high costs incurred in 2018 owing to tit for tat tariffs  compelled the company to cut the outlook for 2018 by almost half  Price Performance Over the

foreign ownership of domestic auto ventures  This will assist foreign automakers to own factories in the country  Notably  this restriction has been in place since 1994  which limits foreign carmakers to own not more than 50  share of any local establishment China will lift foreign ownership limit for the wider car market by 2022  This may open up opportunities for U S  automakers and enable them to earn higher profits  But disentangling the network of collaborations forged with local Chinese companies may not be easy The past week also saw General Motors Company   NYSE GM   announcing layoffs

12398,233913,GPC,Will Genuine Parts  GPC  Beat Earnings Estimates In Q3 ,opinion,"Genuine Parts Company   NYSE GPC   is set to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 19  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1 54   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Genuine Parts is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is currently pegged at  0 78   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Genuine Parts currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  
The combination of Genuine Parts  Zacks Rank  3 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat GENUINE PARTS Price and EPS Surprise
    What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Genuine Parts has undertaken various initiatives to boost sales and earnings  such as product line expansion  penetration into new markets and cost saving activities  The company relies on a diverse product portfolio for top  and bottom line growth  Moreover  its recent acquisitions should drive sales in the quarter to be reported 
For 2016  Genuine Parts expects revenues to increase 2  3  in the Automotive segment  Revenues from the Office Products segment should improve by 2  3   With this  annual revenue of the company is expected to improve 1  2   Earnings per share in 2016 are expected in the range of  4 70  4 75  This outlook compares favorably with earnings per share of  4 63 recorded in 2015  A favorable outlook for the year raises expectations of strong results in the to be reported quarter as well 
However  Genuine Parts is facing challenges in the non automotive business  The Industrial segment s revenue is projected to either remain consistent year over year or rise 1   compared to the previous forecast of a 1  2  increase  The company also trimmed its outlook for the Electrical segment  Revenues from this segment are expected to decrease by 2  3  as against the prior forecast of 1  2  growth 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

The overall projections for the auto sector are looking bleak for Q3 after a strong Q2  By the end of Q3  auto sector earnings and revenues are expected to be down 19 8  and 4 5   respectively  This will place it among the worst performers in the 16 Zacks sectors  In comparison  total S P 500 earnings are projected to decline 1   with revenues rising 1 5  year over year 
A large part of the projected earnings decline in the auto sector is expected due to Ford Motor Company   NYSE F    which will record a  640 million recall related expense in the quarter  As a result  last month the automaker lowered its pre tax guidance for 2016 to a projection of a year over year decline 
Moreover  the fall in U S  auto sales over the last two months is expected to weigh on the results of many automakers  The pressure to maintain attractive incentives and deals may also strain their margins  Moreover  expenses related to safety recalls and the negative impact of foreign currency translation remain headwinds for the sector

12403,233918,GPC,What s The Better Valuation Metric  The P E Ratio Or PEG Ratio,opinion,"Introduction
Recently  I have been engaged in rather intense discussions regarding the validity of P E ratios versus PEG ratios as proper or appropriate valuation metrics  I generally find these types of debates befuddling for a couple of reasons  One  they are often a result of a failure to communicate  Either party or sometimes both parties assume that their adversary holds or supports a specific position which may or may not be a fact 
From my perspective  this was precisely the case regarding the discussion cited in my opening sentence  Assumptions were made regarding my positions on P E ratios and the PEG ratio that were not positions that I actually hold  Consequently  it is hard to argue or debate an issue when you are essentially being required to defend a position that you do not hold 
The second reason I find these types of discussions puzzling is because they are often over generalized  Financial metrics such as the P E ratio or the PEG ratio  like most financial metrics  have their place and their value in financial analysis  Consider that a P E ratio is a statistical metric referencing a single point in time 
However  in the real world  the P E ratio is a dynamic measurement that is constantly changing over time  Moreover  just as it is with all financial metrics  I don t believe any metric is supremely valuable in a vacuum  In my experience and opinion  all financial metrics will only bring investors value and insight when utilized relative to other metrics 
Therefore  with this series of articles I will share my perspectives  opinions and insights into how both the P E ratio and the PEG ratio can be appropriately utilized by investors towards making better informed investment decisions on common stocks  Additionally  I will discuss how both of these commonly used financial metrics are for all intents and purposes joined at the hip  In other words  they are more interrelated metrics than they are separate or distinct valuation tools 
The P E Ratio  Definitions and Insights
The P E ratio is one of the most commonly utilized tools for the serious common stock investor  It is  however  one of the most misunderstood and misused tools  Learning how to use it properly and understanding its significance can significantly increase returns and lower risk 
The P E Ratio   Definitions 
The P E Ratio can be defined in several ways  with each definition adding insight to its significance  The simplest definition is simply the price of the common stock divided by its earnings per share  This is a basic mathematical definition expressed as follows  PRICE Earnings   P E Ratio 
A second commonly used definition is  The P E Ratio is the price you pay to buy  1 00 worth of a company s earnings or profits  For example  if a company s stock has a P E Ratio of 10  then you must pay  10 for every dollar s worth of that company s earnings or profits you buy  If its P E Ratio is 20  then you pay  20 for every dollar s worth of that company s earnings or profits  and so on 
It is important to note  however  that a higher P E Ratio does not necessarily mean that the company has a higher valuation or that it is more expensive than a company with a lower P E Ratio  This fact is not understood by many investors and is the key reason that the P E Ratio has little value by itself or if used in a vacuum  It is theoretically possible  depending on each company s future prospects  that a company with a P E Ratio of 10  for example  can be significantly more expensive than a company with a P E Ratio of 40  I will elaborate on this important point later 
A third definition would be  How many years in advance you are paying for this year s earnings  For example  if a company has a P E Ratio of 20  then you are paying 20 times this year s earnings  If the P E Ratio is 10  you are paying 10 times this year s earnings  and so on  This definition illustrates a simple premise of what an operating business is worth 
What is a Fair Value P E Ratio 
As an example to illustrate this important point  I offer the following analogy based on the earnings of a private business  If you had a private business that was netting you  100 000 net  net  net after all expenses and taxes  it is unlikely that you would sell it to me for  100 000  or a P E Ratio of 1 
A business that generates an annual revenue stream for its owner has a value greater than one year s profits  This is true even if the company is not growing or not growing very fast  For example  let s assume that the above private company does not grow  but that it does pay a consistent  100 000 per year of net income  If the owner sold it for one times earnings   100 000  he or she would essentially have no money coming in after the end of the first year 
So this raises the question  what value should an owner place on a business they are desirous of selling  The optimum value would be to sell the business for a price where the net proceeds could be invested in order to generate a comparable income stream 
Note  since this is being offered as a theoretical mathematical exercise  I will assume no taxes or other costs associated with a sale  Therefore  for illustration purposes  let s assume the owner was confident that he or she could earn a reasonable 6 67  return on their proceeds from the sale of the business  If this were true  the owner would need approximately  1 500 000 net after taxes earning 6 67    1 500 000 x 6 67  equals  100 050  in order to replace the  100 000 per year they were receiving from their business  In other words  this valuation represents a P E ratio of 15 
From the purchaser s perspective  if they paid  1 500 000 for the example business  the P E ratio of 15   he or she in turn would be receiving a current earnings yield of 6 67   Earnings yield  E P  is the inverse of the P E ratio  Since the average rate of return from common stocks has ranged between 6    8  historically  a 6 67  expected current return might be considered reasonable by both the seller and buyer  If this were true  then this transaction theoretically benefits both buyer and seller and could be consummated 
This exercise establishes the P E ratio of 15 as a baseline or rational valuation level from both a buyer s and a seller s perspective  This does not suggest that it is a perfect calculation of fair value  intrinsic value or true worth  Instead  a P E ratio of 15 represents a sound valuation level that a business generating an income stream is worth  even if the business isn t growing  However  this valuation level is only relevant if the business is generating a positive level of earnings  Therefore  I suggest that the reader might consider a P E ratio of 15 as a benchmark for a sound valuation reference for average growing companies 
Moreover  a P E ratio of 15 as a sound valuation reference is useful for most companies when their earnings growth is 15  or less  There are many investors that find this last statement either illogical or hard to accept  However  in my experience analyzing thousands of companies over many decades  the 15 P E ratio as a valuation reference is fully supported in real world circumstances  In my opinion  this speaks loudly to my earlier point that the P E ratio cannot be utilized in a vacuum  Furthermore  a sound valuation does not in itself guarantee a high level of future returns 
In order to ascertain future return potential  I believe the P E ratio needs to be evaluated in relation to the earnings growth potential of the company in question  A 15 P E ratio represents soundness as illustrated in my private company example above  However  it is the P E ratio in relation to the company s earnings growth rate that will produce future capital appreciation and dividend income growth  if a company pays a dividend 
Sound valuation is primarily a measurement of risk associated with making a purchase of a common stock  However  from a total return point of view  it is a relative metric that is best evaluated in conjunction with earnings growth  Nevertheless  the proof is in the pudding as they say  Therefore  I offer the following  where I review several prominent well known stocks in relation to the 15 P E ratio as a standard valuation reference  I will start out with the S P 500  followed by several companies with various earnings growth rates  The company examples are offered in order of lowest earnings growth rates to highest 
The 15 P E Ratio As A Standard Valuation Reference
In order to illustrate the validity of a 15 P E ratio as a benchmark valuation reference  even over different earnings growth rates  I offer the following simplified graphs  There are only three lines on each graph  The bright pink line represents a P E ratio of 15 across the entire graph  The dark blue line represents a calculated normal P E ratio for each example  There is no dividend information included in these graphs because the exercise is designed to evaluate valuation based on earnings as represented by the price to earnings ratio  Finally  the black line plots monthly closing stock prices over the timeframe graphed 
What I am asking the reader to notice is how the price line relates to the 15 P E ratio benchmark over time  There are times when the price will be above the 15 P E ratio benchmark  and times when the price will be below it  However  a close examination of each graph should clearly illustrate the validity of the 15 P E ratio benchmark  It is obviously not a perfect relationship  however  it should be clear that the 15 P E ratio represents a valid valuation benchmark on each example 
There is another important takeaway that I would like to focus the reader s attention on  The 15 P E ratio benchmark clearly illustrates sound valuation  However  the slope of each line is equal to the respective growth rate of each example  Therefore  even though sound valuation is indicated by the same 15 P E ratio  long term price action is determined by the growth rate of each company  the slope of the line  
S P 500 Index
When reviewing the overall stock market as represented by the S P 500 index  we discover a valuation range between a P E ratio of 15  and the normal P E ratio of 17 6  Additionally  we see that the average earnings growth rate of the S P 500 since 2001 has been 5  per annum  Nevertheless  the monthly closing stock prices of the S P 500 correlate very closely to where earnings have gone  More importantly  we see that having the discipline to invest in the S P 500 when its P E ratio was at or below the 15 P E ratio benchmark represented optimum investment opportunities in the index 

Verizon communications Inc   NYSE VZ 
Verizon has the lowest earnings growth rate of any of the samples I will be presenting  Since 2001 Verizon s average earnings growth rate has been 1 9   Nevertheless  the validity of the 15 P E ratio as a fair valuation reference is clear  Whenever price gets above that valuation reference it moves back into alignment and vice versa 

Southern Company  NYSE SO 
My second example looks at Southern Company  which also has a very low earnings growth rate of only 2   However  with this example  earnings growth has been more consistent  Once again  we see how the stock price wants to gravitate to the 15 P E ratio fair valuation reference 

Genuine Parts Company  NYSE GPC 
With my Genuine Parts example I present a company with a similar earnings growth rate of 4 8  similar to the S P 500 earnings growth rate of 5   Once again we see the validity of the 15 P E ratio as a standard valuation reference  The reader should note how relevant the pink 15 P E ratio line is as a valuation standard over this long time frame 

Stanley Black   Decker  Inc   NYSE SWK 
Stanley Black   Decker is my first example where earnings growth is above the average earnings growth of the S P 500  Once again we see the value of utilizing the 15 P E ratio as a standard valuation reference  In this case  the normal P E ratio of 15 6 and the fair valuation reference P E ratio of 15 are closely aligned  The correlation between price and these valuation references are undeniable 

Ryder System  Inc   NYSE R 
Ryder System has also generated an above average earnings growth rate of 7 2   However  in this example we see a significant earnings drop during the Great Recession  This example provides the opportunity to illustrate why the P E ratio must always be looked at relative to other metrics  In other words  even though the 15 P E ratio is a valid valuation reference  it doesn t tell the whole story  This example clearly shows that the P E ratio is a relative metric 

WEC Energy Group  Inc   WEC 
WEC Energy Group  formerly Wisconsin Energy Corporation  NYSE WEC   is one of the fastest growing utilities in America  Since 2001 earnings growth has averaged 8 6  per annum  However  once again we clearly see the validity of the 15 P E ratio valuation reference  Even though this company has grown at an above average rate  the P E ratio of 15 represents a sound valuation level to consider investing in it 

V F  Corporation  VF Corporation  NYSE VFC  
With V F  Corporation we see an example where earnings growth is approaching double digit levels at 9 4  per annum  Nevertheless  we see how valuable and insightful the 15 P E ratio as a valuation reference has been over this historical timeframe  Additionally  since 2013 the stock price had become significantly disconnected from that fair valuation reference level  But price is clearly gravitating back towards that level over the last two years 

The JM Smucker Company  NYSE SJM 
With JM Smucker earnings growth of 11 5  is more than double the average earnings growth of 5  as represented by the S P 500  As we have now entered double digit earnings growth  we see an example where the normal P E ratio of 17 9 might be considered a better valuation reference than the P E ratio 15 standard 
However  even with this faster growing company  the 15 P E ratio valuation reference has still manifested many times since 2001  The point is that the 15 P E ratio valuation reference should not be thought of as an absolute  Instead  it should be thought of as a rational valuation reference even when growth is double digits 

Ball Corporation  NYSE BLL 
Even though we saw a tendency for a higher normal P E ratio with JM Smucker above  the 15 P E ratio valuation reference on faster growing Ball Corporation is quite profound  Ball Corporation has grown earnings at 13 9  since 2001  but in this example both the normal P E ratio of 15 3 and the fair valuation standard P E ratio of 15 are almost identical  I will utilize this same example with a complete F A S T  Graphs  later in this article to illustrate the relative nature of the P E ratio to a company s earnings growth rate towards generating total returns 

With the above examples I demonstrated how the 15 P E ratio represents a rational standard of valuation across various earnings growth rates from low to mid double digits  Moreover  from this perspective the P E ratio of 15 as a standard valuation reference is not an indicator of future returns  Instead  it simply represents a rational level of soundness and or prudence 
The P E Ratio A Relative Metric When Utilized To Calculate Future Returns
Perhaps the most important thing to realize when using P E ratios as an investment tool is that the P E ratio by itself tells you very little about the return potential a stock might offer  As previously discussed  the P E ratio represents a level of soundness based on the earnings yield it represents  Therefore  the P E ratio s true value is as a barometer or tool best utilized to measure soundness  Unfortunately  many investors fail to realize this  and therefore  miss the long term benefits that an understanding of the relevance of the P E ratio at various levels offers 
The P E ratio  used properly  can assist the investor in the rational evaluation of the realistic probabilities of achieving a certain long term rate of return and the amount of risk taken to get there  However  this can only be accomplished when the P E ratio is evaluated in relation to a stock s past  present and future capacity for growth  The primary metrics available to measure a company s growth potential are earnings  cash flows and revenues  However  when utilizing the P E ratio  it is solely based on earnings 
When a stock is purchased at a sound valuation  it represents prudence on the part of the buyer  However  from that point forward  future returns will be a function of how fast the underlying company can grow its business  Therefore  you can pay a sound valuation represented by the same P E ratio of 15  for example  for two companies  one of which is growing faster than the other  However  even though your purchase might be prudent in both cases  the faster growing company will generate a higher long term total return 
With the following examples I present a complete F A S T  Graphs  to include dividends on the slow growing Southern Company versus the faster growing but lower yielding Ball Corporation  I have run calculations on historical returns on both companies based on investing as close as I could to a P E ratio of 15 at the beginning and at the end  In both cases  the 15 P E ratio valuation reference represents soundness  However  a faster growing Ball Corporation produced significantly higher total returns 


Summary and Conclusions
With this part 1 of a two part series I demonstrated the value and the validity of the P E ratio as a valuation tool for companies growing earnings at 15  or less  I pointed out that a P E ratio of 15 represents an earnings yield of 6 67  which I consider a minimum threshold for low to moderate growing businesses  When the P E ratio of companies that fall within this growth rate is higher than 15  the investor should realize that it represents an earnings yield that does not compensate them for the risk they are taking 
But more importantly  as it relates to the promise in the title of this article  the P E ratio is more relevant than the PEG ratio for companies falling into these earnings growth rate capabilities  However  in part 2  I will discuss the superiority of the PEG ratio as a valuation metric when examining growth stocks  As a clue  a PEG ratio of 1 is considered attractive and PEG ratios above 1 are considered less attractive 
However  when examining companies with earnings growth rates lower than 15   the PEG ratio will always be above 1  and sometimes significantly  In the case of a low growth stock such as Southern Company presented in this article  even at a fair valuation P E ratio of 15 its PEG ratio would be 7 5  15 2   Such a high PEG ratio would suggest that the company was significantly overvalued when its P E ratio was 15 even though it is not 
With that said  I am a major advocate of the PEG ratio as an important valuation tool when evaluating fast growing companies  For companies growing earnings at 15  or greater  I consider the PEG superior to the P E ratio as a valuation measurement  In part 2  I will state my case as to why

As with equity markets  the euro didn t have the steep drop off that many expected  This may have been partly due to aggressive EUR USD short covering ahead of the referendum  but by the end of the day  buyers gained the upper hand and the euro hit its highest level in almost three weeks  Still  although currently euro bears aren t nearly as predominant as they were last week  with the virtually assured Fed rate hike on the horizon  the smart money is holding dollars rather than euro 
Following the euro s trajectory  sterling is currently up  as well  trading at 1 2763 
The US dollar has seen some downward pressure over the past two days  flirting with 100 00 earlier today  the first time since the post US election rally that the dollar index came close to breaching 100  a strong point of psychological support  Though many expect the dollar to move up when the Fed announces its rate decision next week  some are taking a more bearish view 
Commodities
Oil prices eased in early trading yesterday  but then continued to climb  as Brent passed  55 per barrel  a fresh 16 month high   It seems that any dip is seen as a buying opportunity   said Carsten Fritsch  analyst at Frankfurt s Commerzbank  Since OPEC s freeze agreement was struck last Thursday  Brent has jumped close to 19   while crude has increased by 16  
Oil is slightly lower this morning  with Brent trading at  54 63 and Crude at  51 47 
Gold s five year bearish tendencies continue  though the metal s downtrend appeared to accelerate more steeply on November 9  following the US election  After rising rapidly to  1 260 to start 2016  upward movement slowed through the middle of the year  However  the recent downturn has been sharp  with the daily chart showing a rapid fall to  1 080 in 2017 could be in the cards

12414,233929,GPC,Should Value Investors Pick Genuine Parts  GPC  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Genuine Parts Company   NYSE GPC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Genuine Parts has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Genuine Parts  current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Genuine Parts has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Genuine Parts stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Genuine Parts has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  GPC is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Genuine Parts currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Genuine Parts a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Genuine Parts might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives GPC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 18 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGenuine Parts is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 39  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  Moreover  broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think

12418,233933,GPC,GPC  A Dividend King With A Safe 3 1  Yield,opinion,"Genuine Parts Company  N GPC  has grown its sales in 63 of the last 65 years and increased its profit in 50 of the last 54 years  How many of your holdings can make those claims 
GPC also has a 3 1  dividend yield and has steadily increased its dividend for 59 consecutive years with dividend growth averaging 7  per year over the past decade 
Very few companies have such a proven track record of steady growth  but GPC offers even more than that  This is the type of company we look for in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewGPC was founded in 1928 and distributes automotive replacement parts  industrial replacement parts  office products  and electrical materials  Its products and services are offered through a network of approximately 2 600 operations throughout the U S   82  of sales   Canada  10    Mexico  1    Australia  7    and New Zealand 
By segment  GPC generated 53  of its 2014 sales from the automotive market  under the NAPA brand   GPC owns about 1 100 of the 6 000 NAPA stores it delivers to   31  from industrial markets  11  from office products  and 5  from electrical materials Business AnalysisGPC s primary competitive advantages are its extensive distribution network  breadth of products  long standing customer relationships  and brand name reputation 
The company is a leading distributor to its four primary end markets with  1 or  2 market share positions in every segment  As one of the largest players  GPC can afford to hold more inventories and offer better delivery times than many of its competitors 
The company maintains about  3 billion worth of merchandise on its balance sheet  Its automotive parts business provides access to nearly 459 000 products and its industrial parts business offers access to more than 5 9 million industrial replacement parts and related supplies  To effectively compete with GPC s leading coverage of products  new entrants would need to invest significantly in inventory 
GPC s network of distribution centers and supply chain management expertise are additional advantages  The company s auto business has the largest auto parts network in the U S  with 60 distribution centers that deliver products to about 6 000 NAPA Auto Care stores 
These distribution centers must be conveniently located and are able to offer 24 7 365 product delivery  Over time  GPC has built a strong reputation for selling quality parts in a timely  cost effective manner  It s also worth noting that roughly 90  of GPC s auto aftermarket parts are branded with the NAPA name  building up meaningful brand value and customer trust  Many of GPC s key accounts  e g  AAA  Goodyear  Firestone  Midas  could not be effectively served by smaller players in the market 
The auto aftermarket industry is roughly  100 billion in size but highly fragmented  GPC s leading market share of 8 9  leaves plenty of room for continued consolidation via organic growth and acquisitions  acquired products can be leveraged across GPC s large distribution network  
GPC s industrial business has been in business for nearly 70 years and benefits from many of the same factors  It also differentiates by maintaining industry leading e business capabilities  This segment s market is  70 billion in size but very fragmented   GPC s market share is just 6  
Unlike selling to original equipment manufacturers  aftermarket business is relatively stable  Vehicles and equipment breaks down and must be replaced  Therefore  the business is less discretionary  Through last year  GPC s sales increased in 63 of the last 65 years  and its profit grew in 50 of the last 54 years 
While GPC has helped itself with strategic acquisitions and organic growth  it has also gotten lucky from favorable industry trends in the automotive aftermarket space 
GPC has noted that the average age of all light vehicles has increased by nearly 50  over the last 20 years to reach nearly 12 years  When consumers maintain older vehicles  more money is spent on repairs and aftermarket parts and services  GPC says that prime years for aftermarket repair start in the sixth year of a vehicle s life and estimates that the automotive aftermarket sector will grow 1 2  per year going forward  Low gas prices are also resulting in more miles being driven  which results in more aftermarket business 
In summary  GPC s businesses operate in slow changing industry and maintain dominant market share positions because of their extensive distribution networks  just in time delivery   leading range of products  brand recognition  and long standing customer relationships Key RisksGPC s business can be impacted any given quarter by currency rates  roughly 20  of the business is overseas   industrial production trends  and the health of the auto market  However  none of these factors seem likely to hurt the company s long term earnings power  and the aftermarket business is generally much steadier than the broader economy 
The bigger risks to owning GPC would likely be if its model came under attack as a result of secular changes in the way cars are made  e g  with higher quality materials and less parts  resulting in fewer repairs needing to be made  or driven  e g  self driving vehicles would presumably get in fewer car accidents and be driven more responsibly  reducing needs to repairs   If the average vehicle age starts to retreat back to levels in the 1990s  that could also reduce GPC s growth rate 
E commerce could be a threat as well  although GPC seems well positioned for this theme with its own websites 
The company s large  highly fragmented  slow changing markets help mitigate these risks Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
GPC has one of the safest dividend payments you can find with a Safety Score of 96  Over the last four quarters  GPC s dividend has consumed 53  of its earnings and 37  of its free cash flow  These payout ratios are pretty consistent with the company s long term payout ratios  see below  and provide GPC with a nice cushion and room for dividend growth Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
GPC s sales have been pretty steady  too  During the financial crisis  the company s revenue dropped by just 9  and earnings fell by 16  in 2009  GPC s stock also performed relatively well  outperforming the S P 500 by 22  during 2008 
As we mentioned earlier  GPC s sales have increased in 63 of the last 65 years  and its profit has grown in 50 of the last 54 years  The company s consistency has been remarkable  and demand for aftermarket replacement parts and services is fairly recession resistant Source  Simply Safe Dividends
GPC s operating margins have been extremely consistent as well  generally remaining between 7  and 8  over the last decade  They only dipped slightly during the recession  highlighting the strength of GPC s business model Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Not surprisingly  GPC generates substantial free cash flow that can be used on acquisitions or returned to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend increases  It s also worth noting that distributors  free cash flow actually increases during recessions because they do not need to replenish as much inventory  converting more of their working capital into cash Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Finally  GPC s balance sheet is also in decent shape  As seen below  long term debt has accounted for less than 20  of the company s total capital in each of the last 10 years  The company has about  200 million in cash compared to  625 million in debt  All of its debt could be retired with cash on hand plus about half of a year of GPC s earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   GPC s balance sheet has the flexibility to acquire more companies for growth  raise its dividend  and or repurchase more shares Source  Simply Safe Dividends
GPC s dividend is one of the safest in the market  The company maintains healthy payout ratios  sells recession resistant products  benefits from a slow pace of change in its markets  has a conservative balance sheet  and reliably generates free cash flow in any environment Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
GPC s dividend Growth Score is 71  suggesting that the company s dividend growth potential is above average  2015 marked GPC s 59th consecutive year of increased dividends paid to shareholders  more than doubling the dividend growth requirement to be part of the S P Dividend Aristocrats Index and also making it a member of the exclusive Dividend Kings list  companies that have increased their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years  
GPC has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948 and most recently increased its dividend by 7  in early 2015  Its 60th consecutive dividend increase will be announced in the first half of 2016 
As seen below  the company has consistently raised its dividend by about 7  per year  Assuming the company continues to grow its earnings at a high single digit rate like it has throughout history  we expect a similar rate of dividend growth to continue  A safe 3 1  dividend yield with upper single digit dividend growth isn t the worst thing for investors living off dividends in retirement  although a somewhat higher yield would be nice Source  Simply Safe DividendsValuationGPC trades at about 16x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 3 1   which is somewhat higher than its five year average dividend yield of 2 7  
GPC believes it can grow its earnings by 7 10  per year  which implies total return potential of 10 13  per year  The stock appears to be no more than fairly valued today ConclusionGPC is practically the definition of a blue chip dividend stock  It generates consistent free cash flow  maintains a conservative balance sheet  operates in a slow changing industry  sells recession resistant products  and has grown its dividend for nearly 60 consecutive years  It s hard to find a more reliable dividend grower than GPC  While its growth numbers will never dazzle shareholders  slow and steady wins the race ",2016-01-16,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gpc:-a-dividend-king-with-a-safe-3.1-yield-380268,380268

12427,233942,GPC,Repair Your Dividend Portfolios With Genuine Parts ,opinion,Genuine Parts Co  GPC  has over 80 years of distribution expertise in replacement parts for automotives and industrial parts  as well as office and electrical materials  It appears to be a company poised for continued earnings and dividend growth  The company is a Dividend Champion with 25 years of raising its dividend  The strong dividend yield should attract a conservative investor looking for income and steady growth    This article looks at Genuine Parts Co  a Dividend Champion  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool  Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures  In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs    Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Champion is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 25 or more straight years  Genuine Parts Co is a dividend champion that has raised its dividend every year for 56 consecutive years  The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled    Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list     Dividend Champion   Genuine Parts Co      Genuine Parts Company is a distributor of automotive replacement parts in the U S   Canada and Mexico  The Company also distributes industrial replacement parts in the U S   Canada and Mexico through its Motion Industries subsidiary  S  P  Richards Company  the Office Products Group  distributes business products nationwide in the U S  and in Canada  The Electrical Electronic Group  EIS  Inc   distributes electrical and electronic components throughout the U S   Canada and Mexico  Genuine Parts Company had 2011 revenues of  12 5 billion     Genuine Parts Co  A Dividend Champion with 56 Consecutive Years of Dividend Increases   Learning from the Past   Looking at Earnings Only   Since dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Genuine Parts Co s earnings per share since 1998  A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Genuine Parts Co has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 5 2   see purple circle on graph  per annum  Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1     The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2     The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Genuine Parts CoThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 4 3  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Genuine Parts Co would have received an additional  54 460 56 in dividends that increased their total return from 4 3  to 6 2  per annum  Note   Since this is a Dividend Champion it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Genuine Parts Co is  76  which is historically normal Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Genuine Parts Co represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Genuine Parts Co has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 9 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Genuine Parts Co long term earnings growth at 8 2   Genuine Parts Co has low long term debt at 15  of capital  Genuine Parts Co is currently trading at a P E of 16 4  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Genuine Parts Co s True Worth valuation would be  90 56 at the end of 2017  which would be a 9 9  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Genuine Parts Co to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Genuine Parts Co s expected earnings would be 5 6 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Champion Genuine Parts Co  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not  Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F A S T  Graphs  on Genuine Parts Co Summary   ConclusionsGenuine Parts Company looks to be reasonably priced with a PE ratio in line with the average company but sporting an above average current yield  Although dividend growth has not been fast  it has been steady  We believe that management is committed to
