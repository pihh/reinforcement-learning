175494,397010,PEP,Better Buy  PepsiCo vs  Anheuser Busch InBev,news,"PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  and Anheuser Busch InBev  NYSE BUD  produce some of the most well known beverages in the world  PepsiCo sells drinks like Pepsi  7 Up  Mountain Dew  Tropicana  Gatorade  Lipton  and Aquafina  It also sells packaged foods through Frito Lay and Quaker Foods 
AB InBev  the world s largest brewer  was created from the combination of Interbrew in Belgium  AmBev in Brazil  SABMiller in London  and Anheuser Busch in the U S  It owns over 500 brands of beers  including Budweiser  Michelob  Stella Artois  Cass  and Hoegaarden  It s also acquired popular craft beer brands like Karbach  Goose Island  Blue Point  and Golden Road in recent years 

PepsiCo and AB InBev are both recession resistant stocks with wide moats and decent dividend yields  But over the past 12 months  PepsiCo s stock rallied about 30  as AB InBev s stock stayed nearly flat  Let s see why PepsiCo outperformed AB InBev  and if that trend will continue throughout the rest of the year 
How do PepsiCo and AB InBev make money 
PepsiCo splits its business into six main segments  PepsiCo Beverages North America  33  of its revenue in the first nine months of 2019   Frito Lay North America  26  of its revenue   Quaker Foods North America  4    and three international units  37    which sell a mix of its drinks and packaged foods 
AB InBev splits its business into five regions  South America  23  of its volume in the first nine months of 2019   Middle Americas  23    North America  20    Asia Pacific  19    EMEA  15    The remaining sliver comes from its global export and holding companies 
Which company is growing faster 
Investors generally focus on PepsiCo and AB InBev s organic revenue growth  which excludes the impact of acquisitions  divestments  and foreign exchange rates 

PepsiCo s organic revenue rose 5  in the first nine months of 2019  with all six of its units reporting positive growth  Its growth was strongest in its AMENA  Asia  Middle East  and North Africa  and Latin American regions  which both generated 8  growth  Quaker Foods North America was the weakest link with just 1  growth 
PepsiCo s organic growth was mainly driven by price hikes  which offset softer shipments of carbonated drinks and packaged foods in more health conscious markets  Despite those challenges  PepsiCo still expects its organic sales to grow by at least 4  for the full year  Analysts expect its reported revenue to rise 3  this year and 4  next year 
AB InBev s organic sales rose 5  in the first nine months of 2019  Its total shipment volumes dipped in North America and Asia  mainly due to competition from local and craft beers and spirits popular among Millennial drinkers in the U S  and China  but it offset those declines with price hikes and the  premiumization  of multiple brands  its volume rose across its other regions  led by nearly 4  growth in the Middle Americas and EMEA regions 
AB InBev didn t provide a full year outlook for its organic sales  but analysts expect its revenue to dip 2  this year and rise nearly 3  next year 
Profitability  valuations  and dividends
PepsiCo expects its core constant currency EPS  which lines up with its organic sales  to dip 1  this year  due to tough comparisons to asset sale and refranchising gains in 2018   incremental  investments in its core business  and a higher tax rate 
Wall Street expects PepsiCo s reported earnings to dip 3  this year and rise 8  next year    which are admittedly tepid growth rates for a stock that trades at 24 times forward earnings  However  jittery investors are likely paying a premium for PepsiCo because it typically holds up well during market downturns 
AB InBev didn t offer precise earnings guidance  but analysts anticipate 30  growth this year  mainly from its listing of Budweiser APAC in Hong Kong last September and the divestments of its Australian operations   followed by flat growth next year    which is also a low growth rate for a stock that trades at 17 times forward earnings 
PepsiCo has raised its dividend annually for nearly five decades and currently pays a forward dividend yield of 2 7   AB InBev  which pays unpredictable semi annual dividends  pays an estimated forward yield of 2 6   PepsiCo and AB InBev spent 87  and 31  of their free cash flows on their dividends over the past 12 months  respectively    so both companies still have room to boost their payouts 
The winner  PepsiCo
PepsiCo s stock is pricier than InBev s  but it owns a better diversified business  faces fewer direct headwinds  and is diversifying into new product categories like sparkling water and hybrid coffee  InBev s business remains broadly stable  but its core brands are clearly losing momentum in the U S  and China  Therefore  investors looking for a defensive stock with a decent dividend should stick with PepsiCo instead of AB InBev ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppst-,2073718
175526,397042,PEP,PepsiCo s advertising blitz drives profit beat  solid forecast,news," Reuters    PepsiCo Inc  O PEP  beat third quarter profit estimates and forecast upbeat revenue growth for 2019 on Thursday  as aggressive advertising and a focus on healthier products spurred demand for its beverages and snacks in North America 
Shares rose 2 2  to  136 83 in premarket trading  as the company said it expects to meet or exceed its fiscal 2019 organic revenue growth target of 4  
Since taking the helm last October  Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta has carved out a multi billion dollar strategy that includes partnering with celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen and ramping up manufacturing capacity for smaller cans to boost demand for out of favor sugary sodas 
The company has splurged on new ads for its trademark Pepsi colas  as well as Mountain Dew and Gatorade beverages  rounding off with a campaign centering around the National Football League s 100th anniversary 
Advertising and marketing expenditure has increased 12  so far this year  the company said 
Gatorade sales have benefited from new low sugar and organic options  and the company said a sugar less version of the sports drink surpassed half a billion dollars in retail sales since its launch in May last year 
Overall beverage sales in North America rose 3 4  in the third quarter to  5 64 billion  also supported by new flavors of its bubly sparkling water brand 
PepsiCo Chief Financial Hugh Johnston told Reuters that he expects bubly to become its next billion dollar brand  with sales rising  dramatically  after a Super Bowl ad earlier this year 
The company s major snack brands  Doritos and Cheetos  also got a boost from the marketing push  even as calorie counting Americans increasingly shift toward healthier options 
On the go lifestyles are helping snack sales  Johnston said 
 With busier lifestyles  there  comes a desire to eat more conveniently  which is a strong tailwind for our business  
Net revenue rose 4 3  to  17 19 billion in the three months ended Sept  7  beating analysts  estimates of  16 93 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
However  the higher investments have been a drag on profit 
The company left its full year core earnings per share forecast unchanged  which  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Bonnie Herzog said was a sign that the cost of achieving top line growth was rising

175556,397072,PEP,To survive trade war  some U S  importers embark on major revamps of product lines,news,"By John Ruwitch and Timothy Aeppel
SHANGHAI NEW YORK  Reuters    When U S President Donald Trump tweeted in May his intention to raise tariffs on Chinese goods  management at California based NewAir Appliances knew they needed to do something or their business would be in trouble 
The importer of beer fridges  ice makers and other household devices   all sourced from China   had tackled 10  tariffs imposed last year by seeking to cut costs and negotiating with big box and other retailers for better terms 
But the jump to 25  tariffs presented a much bigger challenge 
The day after Trump s tweet  NewAir s four member leadership team met for lunch and began to formulate a more radical plan  There was a  level of tension   said Andrew Stephenson  the company s vice president for marketing  but no sense of panic 
The result  an ambitious overhaul of its product offerings  with 50 60 new or revamped goods set to come on the market this year   a move that allows the company to hit the reset button on pricing as their costs leap 
The product turnover is a huge increase for NewAir  which has a range of some 70 goods and usually introduces 10 or fewer new items each year 
Like NewAir  many importers of goods from China have had to make difficult business decisions and sharp changes in strategy as they reel from the impact of U S  tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods 
With consumers and retailers often unwilling to accept higher prices for the same products  oft heard tactics range from accepting lower profit margins  to cost cutting that may include lowering wages or laying off workers  to shifting production from China to other countries 
While the approach taken by NewAir and others in the sector requires significant investment  it underscores how the year long U S  China trade war is forcing some companies to adopt novel workarounds as they fight for long term survival and bump up against the limitations of belt tightening 
 Instead of cutting costs we re going to add some costs  but in the long run it will pay off   Stephenson said by telephone after a trip to China to meet suppliers 
Working closely with suppliers to develop products  he is also implementing measures like air mailing samples to the United States instead using cheaper maritime freight  aiming to slash up to a month off the process of getting goods approved 
 Basically  anything we can do to expedite the process is what we re looking at doing   he said 
NewAir  a company with 50 plus employees  would likely spend  hundreds of thousands of dollars  on the project and was considering hiring a marketing manager  as Stephenson s focus shifts to dealing full time with trade war strategy 
UPFEATURING
NewAir  whose products are sold under its own brand as well as under license with Magic Chef  Frigidaire and PepsiCo Inc  O PEP   is still discussing ways to share the burden of the tariffs with Chinese suppliers and American retailers  It is also looking into sourcing some goods from India and Mexico 
But the cornerstone of its new strategy is the overhaul of its product line 
In addition to items it has not sold before  such as internet enabled wine fridges and combination air fryer ovens  NewAir will retire some old products and give others that have been modified fresh SKUs  or stock keeping units   unique product numbers that retailers use to track inventory  That will allow NewAir and its retailers to set new prices 
Jim Estill  CEO of Danby Appliances  a Canadian company that sources similar products from China and sells many in the United States  calls the strategy  upfeaturing  
 If you re already buying a minifridge for  129   and now it s  149  You re up in arms  But the psychology is completely different if you say   here s the new XYZ  it s  149    and the customer checks the market and sees everyone is charging  149 for the same thing  it s acceptable  
Danby expects to turn over 80  of its product line of about 300 goods in 2019  compared to a normal rate of 30   he said  adding that improvements in technology had made this an opportune time for product revamps 
 If this happened 10 years ago  it would have been tough to say my white box is different  But now you can say I have a freezer that sends you an email when the power is out  
Danby  which makes annual revenue of about  400 million  estimates the cost of revamping its product line at around  4 million 
If the strategy works  it does in part shift some of the costs of tariffs designed to hurt China to the U S  consumer  But it is not risk free 
 When you sell new products at significantly higher prices it will affect your demand somewhat because now you are asking people to upgrade to a better product at much higher prices  How many consumers would have such budgets   said Jing Bing  an associate professor of marketing at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing 
The point of pursuing a trade war  is to ask the American consumers to walk away from Chinese made products   he said  adding   That s precisely the effect  
NewAir CEO Luke Peters said retailers and consumers will get better products and will not see  a huge 25  increase  in prices 
 Our customers  who also have to be profitable  are going to see more value in the products that we re giving to them  So it s kind of forcing us to be more innovative   he said 
But whether or not importers like NewAir can find a balance between higher prices and demand remains to be seen 




 That s going to be the telltale for us  is what happens in about six to nine months   said Stephenson ",2019-07-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/to-survive-trade-war-some-us-importers-embark-on-major-revamps-of-product-lines-1933839,1933839

Marcato Capital Management  which holds Acreage shares  has said it will vote against the deal because it undervalues the New York based company  Marcato believes the value of pot firms will soar with U S  legalization  so  it is highly imprudent for Acreage to sell itself today at the proposed valuation  with so much unlocked growth and value embedded in the company   
Acreage said the view is inconsistent with  the vast majority of shareholders   Still  it marks the first time an activist investor has waded into the cannabis industry and could be a sign of things to come  according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kenneth Shea and Gopal Srinivasan 
Marcato s opposition  may be a precursor of rising shareholder ire targeting cannabis companies that are perceived to not be acting in the best interest of all shareholders    the analysts said in a recent note 
High valuations  unprofitable operations and insular ownership structures may prompt activists to get involved in the industry  the analysts said  Rising short interest in some pot stocks is the first indication of investor dissatisfaction  and has pressured companies like Aphria Inc  to make significant changes to their management teams and boards

Some companies appear to be getting out ahead of this potential trend  Aurora Cannabis Inc  recently hired Nelson Peltz as a strategic adviser  Peltz s Trian Fund Management LP has a long history of agitating for change at consumer companies  including Procter   Gamble Co    Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ   and PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc 311044634
New York based pot firm iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc  hasn t come under pressure from activist investors   in fact  investment research firm Hedgeye Risk Management recently praised its corporate governance  But it s still in the process of revamping its entire board to make it wholly independent by the end of the year  according to Chief Executive Officer Hadley Ford 
 There absolutely will be   a rise in shareholder activism  Ford said in an interview at a cannabis conference last week   Think about it if you re a U S  investor  if a U S  institution s going to come off the sidelines and invest in cannabis  we want them to think about coming into us as the bellwether stock to have exposure to that business   
Some Baggage
It s inevitable that an industry that was illegal until recently in many jurisdictions  and remains illegal in many more  comes with some baggage  said Dan Daviau  CEO of Canaccord Genuity Group Inc   the Canadian investment bank 
 If you were in this industry 10 years ago you were clearly breaking the law somewhere and you were probably a person of a reputation that didn t mind breaking the law    Daviau said in an interview   But the industry is maturing incredibly quickly and I m not saying you still won t see the odd company step on a rake and hit their nose  but the propensity for that to happen has slowed down a lot

175625,397141,PEP,Nestle and Unilever Raise Prices Without Stunting Growth,news," Bloomberg     Europe s consumer goods giants are showing new signs of life by selling more food and cleaning supplies  even at higher prices 
Nestle SA  SIX NESN  and  Unilever   LON ULVR  surprised investors with strong starts to the year  reporting first quarter sales growth that handily topped analysts  estimates  The Swiss maker of KitKat bars and the Anglo Dutch owner of Dove soap each cited a combination of improved pricing and higher volumes 
Unilever rose as much as 3 6 percent in Amsterdam as Nestle traded as much as 1 3 percent higher in Zurich 
The companies delivered a counterpoint to the cost cut driven performance of U S  rival Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co   which has slumped since a profit warning and asset write down in February    about two years after it made an unsuccessful approach to take over Unilever  Instead  the European multinationals joined U S  peers like PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc  in selling more of their products  The companies also successfully passed higher raw materials costs on to consumers 
At Nestle  for example  the pricing gain of 1 2 percent was the biggest in 10 quarters  The businesses most hit by inflation included bottled water  with higher oil prices making plastic and transport more expensive  Unilever also noted higher costs of petrochemicals such as linear alkylbenzene  an ingredient in biodegradable detergents  along with increased prices for raw materials in the food sector 
On Wednesday   Danone  SA  PA DANO  forecast milk price inflation in high single digits this year  plus more expensive sugar and fruit  While sugar prices have risen over the past year  other commodities such as cocoa and coffee have fallen 
 What companies like ourselves face is the impact of the input costs increases and commodity driven gains on the ground   Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said by phone  PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said earlier this week that the drinks and snacks giant expects commodity inflation to increase over the rest of the year 
While Europe and Japan are suffering from stubbornly low price increases or even deflation  higher rates of inflation are popping up in places like Turkey and Argentina  Moroccan consumers have held an informal boycott of Danone products via social media over the past year to protest what consumers see as unfair prices 
While managing to raise prices  Nestle and Unilever also benefited by expanding into new areas as their old line brands stagnate  Sales in Unilever s home care division  which grew at about twice the pace of the group figure  were driven in part by more eco conscious products under the company s Seventh Generation and Omo laundry brands  Acquisitions the Anglo Dutch company has made since 2015 collectively grew at a double digit rate in the quarter 
Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider has signed  14 billion of deals in 2018  The food giant has also been trying to fix or sell underperformers  with a sale for its Herta lunch meat unit possibly coming by midyear and its dermatological business by year end 
Beating Estimates
Nestle s revenue climbed 3 4 percent on an organic basis in the first quarter  as Schneider beat the 2 8 percent analyst consensus by the biggest margin since he started leading the world s largest food company in 2017 
At Unilever  underlying sales rose 3 1 percent in the quarter  As with Nestle  analysts had expected 2 8 percent 
A smaller consumer focused company   Pernod Ricard   PA PERP  SA  joined in the optimism on Thursday  While it missed sales growth estimates for its fiscal third quarter  the French distiller raised its forecast for full year growth in operating profit to about 8 percent from a range of 6 percent to 8 percent

175770,397286,PEP,Powell Places Risky Bet as He Stokes Too Good to Be True Economy,news," Bloomberg     Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is pinning his hopes of stopping the U S  economy from overheating on a variable that a former colleague called  the most significant unobservable of all   inflation expectations 
In recent public appearances  Powell has argued that the Fed can countenance a fall in joblessness to an almost 50 year low without triggering an inflationary surge in large part because Americans believe the central bank will keep prices under wraps   The key is the anchored expectations   he said last week 
The problem is that it s not easy to divine what inflation beliefs are and how they might change  What s more  there s no measure of where companies    arguably the most important players in setting prices    expect the cost of living to go  That makes Powell s focus on price expectations a potentially risky move as the Fed gradually raises interest rates 
 The concept of inflation expectations is quite under theorized and hard to pin down empirically   Powell s former Fed colleague  Daniel Tarullo  said in a speech last October 
Janet Yellen  Powell s predecessor as Fed chair  also understood the limitations   Economists  understanding of exactly how and why inflation expectations change over time is limited   she said in a speech in September 2017 
If inflation were to get out of control  that would be bad news for investors  In recent days  the stock market has been rocked by a rise in Treasury bond yields primarily driven by the economy s strength    not by expectations of faster inflation  Yields could march higher still if rising wages and surging oil prices trigger a spike in consumer prices  forcing the Powell Fed to rethink its gradual strategy for containing inflation 
 There s going to be a little tighter jobs market and a little faster inflation  than the Fed expects  Michael Feroli  chief U S  economist for JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   in New York  said in an interview   The risk is they ll have go a bit further  in raising rates as a result  he said 
Government data on Thursday are expected to show that consumer price inflation eased to 2 4 percent last month from 2 7 percent in August  according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg  The inflation measure the Fed targets    the personal consumption expenditures price index    historically runs about quarter percentage below that gauge 
Tame Prices
The lack of price pressure has spurred a debate about the Phillips curve  an economic model which posits that inflation heats up as the labor market tightens  prompting companies to first boost wages and then prices more broadly as they seek to recoup their additional costs 
That relationship  though  has mostly broken down in recent years as inflation stayed tame despite the drop in unemployment  Powell even quipped last week that  it s really more like a Phillips line  though he cautioned against throwing out the concept entirely 
Inside and outside the Fed  economists have sought to explain the seeming disconnect between consumer price changes and the job market by stressing the importance of inflation expectations  Companies will resist granting workers bigger salary increases if they believe they can t raise prices as well  Employees  in turn  may be satisfied with smaller wage gains if they don t think the pay rises will be eaten up by faster inflation 
 To the extent the public believes that central banks will keep inflation around 2 percent  which is one of our main jobs  that has tended to reduce the sensitivity of inflation to changes in unemployment   Powell said on Oct  3 
Goldilocks Economy
He maintains that will help the U S  enjoy something it hasn t experienced since 1950    an extended period of low  stable inflation and very low unemployment   This forecast is not too good to be true   he said on Oct  2 
Academic economists who ve studied the Phillips curve are not as sanguine 
 We ve got this unbelievable momentum  in the labor market that could drive joblessness well below its current 3 7 percent  Harvard University professor James Stock told reporters on Sept  30   We re likely to see inflation rates of 2 5  and then everyone is going to get way stressed out about how we re going to handle that  
Northwestern University s Robert Gordon and Johns Hopkins University s Laurence Ball agreed that price gains are likely to accelerate   If unemployment stays at 3 7 or 3 5 percent  it is likely inflation will rise significantly above 2 percent   Ball said  though he added the Fed shouldn t overreact to that 
Powell has said the Fed stands  ready to act with authority  if inflation expectations  drift materially up or down   The catch  He may not know that s happened until it s too late 
To assess expectations  the central bank depends on surveys of economists and households and on trading in the bond market  especially demand for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  Each has weaknesses 
Economists tend to reflect what the Fed tells them while consumers may not fully understand what they re being asked  And bond dealings can be distorted by liquidity and other considerations 
Meanwhile  there are signs that businesses have gained pricing power as economic growth has accelerated  especially if they can justify their price increases by pointing to higher tariffs on U S  imports  A survey of manufacturing and non manufacturing companies by IHS Markit found that their average selling prices rose at the fastest rate of the nine year old expansion in September 
Among companies that have recently announced or warned of impending price increases are PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  Inc   Samsonite International SA and Steven Madden Ltd 
It is paradoxical that Powell is making policy contingent on a squishy concept like inflation expectations  He has  after all  repeatedly cautioned against leaning too heavily on such  unobservable  variables as the natural rate of unemployment or the neutral interest rate 
 Over my time at the Fed  I came to worry that inflation expectations are bearing an awful lot of weight in monetary policy these days   said Tarullo  who left the central bank last year to become a Harvard Law School professor ",2018-10-10,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/powell-places-risky-bet-as-he-stokes-toogoodtobetrue-economy-1638073,1638073

175789,397305,PEP,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Pepsi Profit Expected to Climb
While earnings season doesn t really pick up until the middle of the month  the names on the lighter calendar are bigger 
PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   known for its cola but driven more by its snack business now  will report results before the bell tomorrow 
On average  analysts are expecting that the company earned  1 57 per share  Sales are expected to edge up just slightly to about  16 4 billion  suggesting that analysts expect margins to strengthen to boost earnings 
Shares of Pepsi have been climbing since a low in May  but are down year to date 
2  Powell Speaking Midday
The economic calendar is also sparse tomorrow  The ISM New York business conditions index arrives at 9 45 AM ET  13 45 GMT  
But at 12 00 PM ET  the market will get remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell 
Powell will speak at the 60th National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting in Boston

Right now  traders are pricing in about a 77  chance of another rise  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool 
3  Oil Rally Still Running
Oil prices will be closely watched tomorrow to see if they can lift energy stocks further 
The S P Energy Sector index rose about 1 5  today as crude continued to rally on worries that there will not be enough supply to make up for a loss of Iranian exports 
Both Brent and WTI are up about 25   on average year to date  on worries that neither the combined forces of Russian and Saudi Arabian production or the sheer dynamism of U S  shale  which flooded the world with cheap oil between 2014 and 2017  will be enough to counter the projected global shortfall in supply from November  Many analysts now think  100 for Brent might be possible by the year end or in early 2019

175790,397306,PEP,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday  October 2 
1  Italy s Political Woes Continue
Investor concerns over Italy continued on Tuesday  after Claudio Borghi  head of the lower house s budget committee  said Italy would have solved its fiscal problems with its own currency 
His comments prompted the yield on the 10 year Italian bond to rise to 3 41   the highest level since March 2014  prompting worry of a spillover effect into other European sectors 
Last week Italy s government announced a budget deficit that would increase spending and cut taxes but would raise the debt limit in breach of European Union budget rules  The European Commission is expected to reject Italy s budget plans 
EU officials have warned its plan to borrow billions of extra euros to fund spending pledges could tip the bloc back into crisis  Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said Italy would not change its budget deficit targets 
2  U S  Crude Prices Hit 4 Year High
U S  oil prices hit their highest level since November 2014 amid fears over a looming supply crunch once U S  sanctions are re imposed on Iran next month 
U S  crude prices hit a high of   75 91 a barrel and were last trading at  75 30  after rallying 2 76  in the previous session 
London traded Brent crude futures were down 0 46  to  84 62 a barrel  pulling away from an overnight high of  85 33  which was also a four year peak 
The impending loss of supply from Iran has seen oil prices rally  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non OPEC members  including Russia  have little spare capacity to boost output in order to offset falling global supply 
Iran is the world s fourth largest oil producer and the third largest exporter in OPEC  Many analysts now think  100 for Brent might be possible by the year end or in early 2019 
The American Petroleum Institute will release its latest weekly figures on inventories at 23 30 ET  Stockpiles came in at about 2 9 million the previous week 
3  U S  Futures Point to Lower Open on Wall Street
U S  futures were lower on Tuesday  as optimism over a reworked U S  Canada trade deal faded and Italy s budget crisis spooked investors 
The S P 500 futures fell 0 38  while Dow futures lost 0 41  and tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0 56  
In earnings news  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  is expected to report results before the opening bell  Analysts expect earnings of  1 57 per share while sales are expected to edge up to  16 4 billion 
Overnight in Asia  the Shanghai composite closed higher  rising 1 06  while the China A50 Index increased 1 18   The Hang Seng Index was down 2 38  after China reported weaker than expected manufacturing data  In Japan  the TOPIX closed 0 33  higher and the Nikkei 225 lost 0 07  
Trading in Europe was lower  with all major indexes in the red as Italy s budget woes weighed on bank stocks 
4  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to Speak
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to speak at 12 00 PM ET  16 00 GMT  at the 60th National Association for Business Economics Annual Meeting in Boston

176005,397521,PEP,Coca Cola  PespiCo and others agree to cap sugar in drinks in Singapore,news,"By Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE  Reuters    Seven major drinks companies including Coca Cola and PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  will limit the sugar content of drinks they sell in Singapore  as part of the city state s campaign to fight diabetes 
Singapore is one of the first countries in Asia to target sugary drinks  bringing it in line with many Western nations that have sought to mitigate the health risks associated with sugar through measures such as taxes and warning labels 
Globally  beverage firms have been reworking recipes  racing to cut sugar and introduced more options to cater to increasingly health conscious consumers 
On Tuesday  Singapore s ministry of health said the seven firms had signed an industry pledge to remove by 2020 drinks that contain more than 12 percent sugar from their portfolios of sugar sweetened beverages 
As well as Coca Cola and PepsiCo  the companies include F N Foods  Malaysia Dairy Industries  Nestle  Pokka  POKKA UL  and Yeo Hiap Seng 
 In addition to this industry commitment  Coca Cola Singapore is making an additional commitment to reduce the sugar content in our portfolio of sugar sweetened beverages by 10 percent by 2020   Coca Cola said in an email to Reuters 
It said it had been reducing sugar and calories across many of its brands  and offering more new drinks with low sugar content or no added sugar 
Daily sugar consumption per capita from soft drinks has risen since 2010 to 6 08 grams in Asia Pacific in 2016  with Singapore at 11 99 grams  according to market research firm Euromonitor  Consumption has been trending lower in Europe and the United States  but it is still higher than in Asia Pacific 
 Governments in Asia are actively promoting healthy consumption  such as Malaysia which launched its Healthier Choices Logo in April 2017   said Euromonitor International analyst Nathanael Lim   Consumers also have an increasing preference for beverages containing natural ingredients with zero sugar  
The World Health Organization said last year drinking fewer calorific sweet drinks was the best way to curb excessive weight and prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes  although fat and salt in processed foods were also to blame 
Among Asian countries  the Philippines has slapped levies on sugar sweetened beverages  while Indonesia and India have been considering similar taxes 
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong mentioned the drinks makers  agreement in a speech on Sunday  in which he also urged people to drink water  eat wholemeal bread and brown rice  but did provide details ",2017-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cocacola-pespico-and-others-agree-to-cap-sugar-in-drinks-in-singapore-520986,520986

176095,397611,PEP,Earnings Preview  PepsiCo  PEP  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4  
Revenues are expected to be  20 38 billion  up 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 78  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo 
For PepsiCo  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of  1 50 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 56  delivering a surprise of  4  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PepsiCo doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-pepsico-pep-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200505376,200505376
176096,397612,PEP,3 Things To Know About The Q4 Earnings Season,opinion,"We can say with a fair amount of confidence that the Q4 earnings season has turned out to be a good one  with decent momentum on the revenues side and earnings growth on track to turn positive 
We share below the three main takeaways from the results thus far  Please note that through Friday  February 7th  we have seen Q4 results from 323 S P 500 members or 64 6  of the index s total membership 
First  momentum on the revenues side  For the 323 index members that have reported already  total earnings and revenues are up  0 3  and  4   respectively  The proportion of these companies beating EPS and revenue estimates is 72 1  and 67 8   respectively 
The comparison charts below put the earnings and revenue growth rates and the EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context 
 
 
 
 
And here are the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages 
 
 
 
 
It is possible to focus only on the revenue performance in the above comparison charts  but we will make it even easier for you by just showing how the Q4 top line performance stacks up relative to the first three quarters of 2019 
 
 
 
 
As you can see here  a much bigger proportion of companies are beating top line estimates  with the EPS beats percentage actually tracking below historical periods  The revenues growth rate doesn t show the same level momentum  but it has nevertheless help fairly well 
Second  earnings growth on track to turn positive in Q4  As we saw earlier  earnings for the 323 index members that have reported already are up  0 3  from the same period last year  For the quarter as a whole  combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies  Q4 earnings are expected to be up  0 6  on a year over year basis 
This is the first time that the blended Q4 earnings growth rate has turned positive this earnings season and would follow the  1 7  decline in S P 500 earnings in the preceding period  2019 Q3   Please note that the anemic earnings growth pace in 2019 is primarily because of tough comparisons to the 2018 numbers that were boosted by the tax cut legislation   Normal  growth resumes in the current period  2020 Q1  and accelerates into the back half of the year and beyond    
Third  current period estimates coming down  with the Coronavirus adding to the typical negative revision that would take place any way  We got off to a good start with respect to estimate revisions for 2020 Q1  but that has clearly reversed in recent days  as the chart below shows 
 
 
 
 
It is totally normal for current period estimates to be coming down as companies release their quarterly results and the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates still compares favorably to historical periods  But the additional factor this time around is the Coronavirus outbreak that has clear negative earnings implications  as many companies like Starbucks  SBUX   Disney  DIS  and others have publicly acknowledged 
But the full extent of the virus outbreak will only become clearer over time  We don t know at this stage whether the outbreak s negative impact will be a one quarter phenomenon or it will seep into the following periods as well 
This week s docket of earnings releases include a number of companies whose results can be expected to be significantly exposed to the outbreak  These include China s Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and travel operators TripAdvisor  TRIP  and Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   EXPE  
Overall  we have more than 430 companies on deck to report results this week  including 66 S P 500 members  Cisco  CSCO   Pepsi  PEP   Nvidia  NVDA  and Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   AMAT  are some of the other notable companies reporting results this week   
Tech Sector Scorecard 
We now have Q4 results from 86 1  of the Tech sector s market capitalization in the S P 500 index  Total earnings  or aggregate net income  for these Tech companies are up  5 5  from the same period last year on  6 1  higher revenues  with 87 2  beating EPS estimates and an equivalent proportion beating revenue estimates 
This represents a notable improvement in the sector s earnings performance  as the comparison charts below show 
Here is the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rate relative to the first three quarters of the year 
 
 
 
 
And here is the Tech sector s Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentage relative to the first three quarters of 2019 
 
 
 
 
Q4 Expectations for the S P 500 Index
Looking at Q4 expectations as a whole  combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still to come companies  total earnings  or aggregate net income  for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  0 6  from the same period last year on  4 2  higher revenues 
The table below shows the summary picture for Q4  contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding earnings season 
 
 
 
 
The chart below shows Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following four quarters and actual results in the preceding 4 quarters  As you can see  the growth pace is expected to start improving from next quarter onwards

Despite this economic strength  the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 277 points  while the S P 500 and NASDAQ both declined 0 54  during the trading day  That trend is likely to continue as health officials globally scramble to control the epidemic and officials warn about the economic cost of the outbreak 
Chinese authorities said fatalities in China from the coronavirus reached a single day high of 89 on Saturday  on Friday they also confirmed 3 399 new cases of infections from the virus that causes respiratory illnesses  bringing the total number of people infected to 37 198

1  CVS Health
CVS Health  NYSE CVS  reports on Wednesday  Feb  12  before the market opens  For the fourth quarter of 2019  analysts expect earnings per share of  1 68 on sales of  63 9 billion 
The drug store chain raised its 2019 earnings forecast a couple of times  helped by growing revenue and profit from the company s drug benefits unit  CVS s success is being driven by a diverse mix of corner pharmacies  drug benefit related services and health insurance  an agglomeration of strength competitors are lacking 

At the same time  the company has been transforming some of its stores into  health hubs   transitioning retail floor space into areas where customers can get medical and other health services  Even as the Rhode Island based health services company raised its profit forecast in November  retail rival Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  has been slashing costs and closing stores 
This strong growth also helped CVS shares  which rose more than 23  in the past six months  outperforming peers  The stock closed on Friday at  71 56 after gaining more than 1  for the day 
2  PepsiCo Inc 
Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  will report fourth quarter earnings on Thursday  Feb  13  before the market opens  Analysts  on average  expect  1 44 a share profit on sales of  20 24 billion 
Last year  Pepsi continued its strong growth momentum as consumers didn t put a brake on their purchases despite the soda maker raising prices for its products  Pepsi said in October it will meet or exceed its full year revenue growth after sales and profit both topped Wall Street estimates for Q3 

That report had provided strong evidence that Pepsi s sales momentum is backed by a robust demand revival and the success of the company s product mix which includes such popular brands as Tropicana  Pepsi  Frito Lay and Tostitos brand chips 
After rising 28 5  in the past 12 months  Pepsi hit a record high on Friday of  145 72  the stock closed just a hair lower  at  145 37 
3  NVIDIA Corporation
One of the world s largest chipmakers  NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   also reports Q4 earnings on Thursday  albeit after the close  Analysts are expecting EPS of  1 66 a share on revenues of  2 96 billion

176106,397622,PEP,Food  drink giants plot fightback as India looks to tighten rules,news,"By Aditya Kalra NEW DELHI  Reuters    Several food and drink multinationals and trade groups met in recent weeks to discuss how to lobby more effectively against Indian proposals for higher taxes and stricter labeling rules on fatty or sugary foods  sources familiar with the talks said  According to officials  Prime Minister Narendra Modi s administration has begun to look closely at policy proposals under discussion since at least 2015  raising concerns over the possible impact on the  57 billion sector  Alarmed by rising rates of obesity and diabetes  India plans to frame draft rules within a month requiring manufacturers to display the fat  sugar and salt content of products on packaging  It is also considering a nationwide  fat tax  for so called  junk foods   a senior government official said  although that is unlikely to be rolled out in the near term  Last month  executives from companies including PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Nestle and Indian consumer firm ITC met trade groups in New Delhi to coordinate efforts and urge the government to resist pressure from health advocates  according to an industry source aware of the meeting  The attendees  who felt their efforts to push back had been too piecemeal  talked about forming a core group to unify their message when engaging the government  the source said  PepsiCo and Nestle in India did not comment directly on the meeting or its outcome  ITC did not respond to requests for comment  Trade group All India Food Processors  Association  AIFPA   whose members range from street vendors to global conglomerates  said two industry wide meetings were held in February  Its members  who also discussed ways to offer more nutritious products  plan to send a joint representation to the government and approach health and food officials to express concerns about stringent regulations  PROMISING GROWTH The stakes are high for companies like PepsiCo  Coca Cola  Nestle and McDonald s  which have collectively committed billions of dollars to expand in the world s fastest growing major economy  India s carbonated drinks sector is estimated to grow an average 3 7 percent annually between 2017 and 2021  while the packaged food sector will grow by 8 percent a year during the same period  Euromonitor International estimates  Government pressure comes in various forms  Modi recently told PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi that her company needed to focus more on public health  an aide to the prime minister said  Separately  the prime minister s office asked PepsiCo to outline how it would reduce sugar in beverages sold in India  the aide added  PepsiCo did not comment on those remarks by Modi and his office  It referred Reuters to its October 2016 global commitment  to transform its portfolio and offer healthier options   Modi s office did not respond to an email seeking comment  A Coca Cola India representative referred questions on proposed regulatory changes to the Indian Beverage Association  which said their impact was  under evaluation   Nestle corporate affairs executive Sanjay Khajuria said the company was  working to improve the nutrient profile  of their products   These are complex public health issues which require  a  holistic multi stakeholder approach and we are committed to work with authorities   Khajuria said in an email  The CEO of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India  FSSAI   Pawan Kumar Agarwal  welcomed industry concerns about tougher rules   It is a good thing if it helps in providing healthier options   he told Reuters in an interview  PLANNED REGULATIONS The number of obese men and women in India rose to about 30 million by 2014 from 1 2 million in 1975  according to a study by British medical journal The Lancet  although the comparative figure for China was around 90 million  Concerns about the health effects of fast food and soda drinks have been growing globally in recent years  Mexico imposed higher taxes on sugar sweetened beverages  for example  while South Korea placed television advertising restrictions on specific food items  But India has been slow to finalise rules on products high in fat  sugar and salt  whose consumption health advocates say urgently needs to be checked to safeguard public health  Agarwal denied industry pressure was affecting the implementation of tighter regulations  adding that India was nudging companies to make healthier products while working on new rules  The FSSAI is considering advertising norms to check on health claims made by companies and is working on educating consumers about the health effects of foods containing high levels of sugar or fat  One government official said the regulator was deliberating whether disclosures about the nutritional value of food should be placed on the front of packages  Another labeling proposal under review was a  traffic light  system  where red  yellow and green colours depict nutritional value  similar to one used in the United Kingdom   Traffic light is making  reading labels  simple   Agarwal said   Red people associate with danger  green is okay   But trade body AIFPA said such labeling was of no use   Most Indian foods will be red  So what purpose does it serve   said the group s president  Subodh Jindal  Potentially more significant for major brands would be a nationwide  fat tax   which authorities are discussing and was last year announced by the southern state of Kerala  There  branded restaurants like McDonald s and Domino s Pizza face a 14 5 percent tax  higher than that applied to smaller  indigenous outlets serving the same fare or Indian cuisine often high in sugar and fat   It makes the larger players nervous   said an industry executive  calling the discourse on  junk food  in India discriminatory and unscientific

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits

176151,397667,PEP,Venezuela s  beer war  mirrors hostile politics,news,"By Diego Or  CARACAS  Reuters    Running short of raw materials in mid 2015  Venezuela s two biggest beer makers Polar and Regional publicly chided the socialist government for delays in releasing foreign currency to import hops  barley and tin for cans  Their stance in a joint communique angered President Nicolas Maduro s administration  which allocates dollars to businesses under currency controls that are a cornerstone of Venezuela s state led economic model  beer industry sources said   But it then dealt with the two companies very differently   Executives at Regional met surreptitiously with government officials  and weeks later the currency board coughed up crucial dollars for hop imports  a plant expansion and some foreign debt payments  said sources close to the talks   But Polar  Venezuela s largest private company whose high profile owner Lorenzo Mendoza is cast by the government as a symbol of callous capitalism and architect of an  economic war  against socialism  was given the cold shoulder  It received fewer dollars   then not a single one this year   while inspections of its factories and detentions of its managers multiplied  Venezuela s beer war had begun  with a political flavor   We are being subject to discrimination  it is public and notorious  we have requested  currency  countless times this year  every day  and they have not given us anything  not once   said Marisa Guinand  director of Polar Brewery  at her office in an industrial zone of Venezuela s capital  Caracas   We will keep insisting until they assign currency as they do to the competitor  Regional  and to many other businesses in this market   added Guinand  Government officials did not respond to requests for comment on the accusation that it was discriminating against Polar  in a nation where more beer is consumed than milk   Polar s complaints mirror what plenty of local and foreign businessmen operating in Venezuela say in private  play ball with the government and all will be well  speak out and harassment may follow  Regional  a company of 3 790 workers which began in 1929 in Venezuela s second city Maracaibo and is owned by the billionaire Cisneros family  has denied favoritism  But it is not the first time  Chavismo   as the ruling socialists are known due to their late founder Hugo Chavez  and the Cisneros family appear to have found common ground  In 2004  during a push for a referendum vote to remove Chavez from power  the multimillionaire Gustavo Cisneros  uncle of Regional s current low profile boss Andres Cisneros  met Venezuela s then president at an army base  Although Gustavo Cisneros denied making a deal with Chavez  his businesses  including local TV channel Venevision and the country s franchise for the DirecTV network  went on to flourish while others suffered state takeovers   His main TV competition  pro opposition RCTV station  lost its license and went off the air  DOLLAR SUPPLIES DRY UP  It was Chavez who in 2003 introduced the currency controls that have become so problematic for companies in Venezuela   Whereas Chavez enjoyed an oil revenue bonanza that gave his government plenty of access to dollars  the tap has dried up under Maduro s presidency amid a crash in global crude prices since 2014 and the OPEC nation s unprecedented economic crisis  Though there is no official data and state currency board Cencoex did not respond to questions from Reuters  local consultancy Ecoanalitica calculates the government has sold just  18 million a day this year  63 percent less than 2015  That has left not just Polar  but other businesses from automakers to food importers  clamoring for ever scarcer dollars which can only be legally obtained from the state   Shortly after issuing the critical communique along with Polar  Regional executives began meeting with the government  The company then moderated its tone and announced it had sufficient raw materials and supplies for full output  The difference in treatment has driven a wedge between Polar and Regional which  despite being direct competitors  previously had a sometimes cooperative relationship  even lending each other raw materials for making beer    For our size and needs  we ve had an ok access  to dollars    said Carolina Requena  marketing manager for Regional Breweries  which has 15 percent of Venezuela s market compared to Polar s 80 percent   Since February     we have asked four times and they have given us four times  though less than we requested   Other smaller breweries told Reuters they were being assigned dollars in timely fashion from the currency control board to import raw materials  although together they produce less than 1 percent of the country s beer  Polar  which began producing beer in 1941  lodged a formal complaint in August at the International Labor Organization  ILO  for  harassment and discrimination   Pro government union groups within Polar s 10 000 strong workforce have led labor disputes leading to plant closures in the last year  And so far in 2016  the military has briefly detained a dozen of its managers in around 800 inspections  Like Chavez before him  Maduro often singles out the long haired  U S  educated Mendoza in public tirades  accusing him of hoarding products and provoking shortages   If you can t manage your companies  give them up to the people  Bandit  thief  oligarch  traitor   Maduro thundered in one recent public speech  as a crowd demanded  Expropriate   Mendoza has been publicly critical of the government s economic policies  and is touted by some Venezuelans as a possible future presidential candidate  Opinion polls show his company and products are popular among Venezuelans  In April  Polar closed all four of its plants for two months after running out of raw materials  though it later obtained a  35 million loan from Spanish bank BBVA  MC BBVA   to reopen two  Still  hit by economic crisis and the shortage of dollars  it is currently producing 50 60 million liters of beer per month  down from 140 150 million liters last year  BEER AND BASEBALL The beer war has even spilled over into sport  with two baseball teams run by people close to the government   the Aragua Tigers and the La Guaira Sharks   replacing Polar with Regional as their sponsors  The change  an important one given that beer sales rise during the baseball season  was part of the agreement reached between Regional s Cisneros and government officials in four or five meetings over about a month  said the sources with direct knowledge of the talks  Last year  Venezuelans were the biggest per capita consumers of beer in Latin America  89 liters annually  according to the World Health Organization  WHO   Yet due to a third year of recession  scarcity of raw materials and Venezuelans  fast shrinking purchasing power  the local market is now crashing  Regional predicts a 50 percent drop in sales for 2016  and Polar sees an even bigger fall of 60 percent  Even so  it remains a profitable business and Polar s brewery arm still subsidizes the rest of the conglomerate  which also produces Pepsi Cola  N PEP  and flour for Venezuela s staple  arepa  cornbread  Currently working at 40 percent brewing capacity  Polar estimates it has enough materials to

176165,397681,PEP,PepsiCo misleads buyers of Naked juice  lawsuit says,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters    PepsiCo Inc  N PEP  has been accused in a lawsuit of misleading shoppers into believing its Naked juices and smoothies primarily contain  high value  ingredients such as kale  when the main ingredient is often cheaper  less nutritious apple juice 
According to a complaint filed on Tuesday in the Brooklyn  New York federal court  PepsiCo emblazons healthy fruits and vegetables on Naked labels  and touts how the drinks have  no sugar added   when they actually contain roughly as much sugar as a can of Pepsi 
PepsiCo did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
The lawsuit was filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest  a Washington  D C  based nonprofit group  on behalf of three shoppers 
Dina Lipkind of Brooklyn  Lyle Takeshita of Los Angeles and Chad Fenwick of Chatsworth  California claim they overpaid for Naked drinks such as Kale Blazer and Green Machine 
The label for Kale Blazer  for example  promises a  royal roundtable of yum  from its blend of kale with  cucumber  spinach  celery and a pinch of ginger  the complaint said 
But according to the label  kale puree is only the second listed ingredient  between orange juice and apple juice  and a 15 2 ounce serving contains 34 grams of sugar 
Other Naked drinks contain as much as 61 grams of sugar  the complaint said  In contrast  a 12 ounce Pepsi contains 41 grams 
PepsiCo  deliberately cultivates  consumer misperceptions through its marketing of Naked drinks  the complaint said 
The lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of shoppers nationwide and in New York and California  It also seeks unspecified damages from Purchase  New York based PepsiCo 
In 2013  PepsiCo agreed to stop calling Naked juices  all natural  as part of a  9 million settlement

176170,397686,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Set To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store For The Beverage Giant  ,opinion,"PepsiCo   NASDAQ PEP   is set to report their third quarter results on Thursday before the opening bell  The beverage giant s shares have climbed 22 1  in 2019 thus far  outpacing the broader beverage market s 20 2  gain 
The company is coming off a second quarter where it beat on both the top and bottom lines  and reaffirmed financial guidance for fiscal 2019  This upcoming earnings season will be heavily monitored by Wall Street as recession fears circulate throughout the market  Pepsi is one of the large cap companies reporting early this earnings season  so let s take a look at how the firm might report on Thursday 
Company Overview 
PepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies  Its brands include Frito Lay snacks  Pepsi Cola beverages  Gatorade sports drinks  Tropicana juices and Quaker foods  The company serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories  The food and drink giant owes its performance thus far to its robust surprise trend  Q2 marked its eighth sales beat in the last 10 quarters and its 13th positive earnings surprise in the last 14 quarters 
Pepsi reported a 2 2  hike in net revenue to  16 4 billion but core EPS fell 7 2  to  1 54 per share  Organic revenue expanded by 4 5  after growing by 5 2  in the first quarter 
Organic growth was led by a 4 5  expansion in the company s second largest segment  Frito Lay North America  Latin America and Europe Sub Saharan Africa  ESSA  enjoyed top line gains of 2  and 0 5   respectively  while Asia  Middle East  and North Africa  AMENA  fell 1   Quaker Foods North America  QFNA  saw a 2  jump in sales and PepsiCo Beverages North America  PBNA  popped 2  
Q3 and Beyond Outlook 
PepsiCo expects full year organic revenue growth of 4   Management anticipates that core diluted earnings per share will decline 1  on a constant currency basis 
Our Q3 consensus estimates project core earnings to fall 5 66  to  1 50 per share and for net revenue to pop 2 9  to  16 96 billion  The Frito Lay North America segment is projected to continue its growth campaign with a 5 1  spike to  4 09 billion  The North America Pepsi Beverages and Europe Sub Saharan Africa divisions are forecasted to jump 1 21  and 4 61   respectively  Quaker Foods North America is expected to increase 0 81  while the Latin America segment should see a 3  gain  The Asia  Middle East and North Africa division is anticipated to grow a moderate 0 5  
Looking ahead to our full fiscal 2019 estimates  Pepsi s bottom line is forecasted to slip 2 65  to  5 51 per share while net sales is projected to come in at  66 5 billion  The Europe Sub Saharan Africa and Frito Lay North America segments are expected to lead the top line growth in fiscal 2019  with respective gains of 4 76  and 4 59  
Bottom Line 
Pepsi s announcement tomorrow will be closely watched by Wall Street as investors look for any indications of what might be ahead not only for Pepsi but for the Q3 earnings season as a whole  Pepsi s robust top line growth is projected to continue in Q3  but its bottom line struggles are also predicted to continue 
The company is planning to ramp up spending in a few places over the next six months  including marketing support for its brands  and investments in upgrading manufacturing  However  the firm reported that the spending is expected to continue to weigh on earnings until 2020 at the earliest  Estimate revisions have trended lower for Q4 and beyond  giving Pepsi a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

176171,397687,PEP,Options Bears Predict Post Earnings Pullback For PEP Stock,opinion,"Food and beverage concern PepsiCo Inc  NASDAQ PEP  is down 1 5  at  135 33 today  just ahead of its third quarter earnings  slated for release before the open tomorrow  This dip follows the equity s second highest close on record  ending yesterday at  137 37    just beneath its early September peak around  139  In fact  PEP has been climbing steadily higher for the better part of the year  up 22  since the beginning of January  with its last pullback caught by the 120 moving average 





 
Some options players today  however  are expecting a steep pullback for PEP  Over 5 000 puts have exchanged hands so far    two times what is normally seen at this point    compared to only 2 500 calls  Some of this action is taking place at the weekly 11 8 137 strike put  where contracts are being opened at a volume weighted average price of  3 40  This means these buyers will profit if the stock falls below  133 60  strike minus premium paid  by the time these contracts expire on Nov  8  
This bearish sentiment is nothing new  though  On the the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Cboe Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   PEP sports a 50 day put call volume ratio of 0 85  This ratio sits higher than 90  of all other readings from the past year  suggesting a healthier than usual appetite for puts over calls of late  
Historically speaking  PEP has tended to make fairly modest moves following its last eight earnings reports  While six of these eight post earnings swings were positive  the stock s average next day return is just 2   regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a slightly wider than average 4  swing  
Analysts are split on the Frito Lay owner  with half dubbing the security a  strong buy   while the other half say  hold   The 12 month consensus target price of  135 15  on the other hand  is right in line with current levels  Should Pepsi earnings exceed expectations tomorrow  an unwinding of pessimism in the options pits  or a round of upbeat analyst attention  could push the shares to new heights ",2019-10-03,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/options-bears-predict-postearnings-pullback-for-pep-stock-200470145,200470145
176173,397689,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Q3 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"PepsiCo  PEP  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 56 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 50 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 59 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4   A quarter ago  it was expected that this food and beverage company would post earnings of  1 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 54  delivering a surprise of 3 36  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
PepsiCo  which belongs to the Zacks Beverages   Soft drinks industry  posted revenues of  17 19 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 32   This compares to year ago revenues of  16 49 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
PepsiCo shares have added about 21 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 2  
What s Next for PepsiCo 
While PepsiCo has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for PepsiCo was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 50 on  20 36 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 51 on  66 53 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Put some of the cash pile into safe funds and stocks  I can show you where to find 7 2  yields  which means you can build a  no withdrawal  portfolio that spins off  say   72 000 on a million bucks  again  thanks to the 7 2  dividends  
Of course  today mainstream bonds pay 1  something and few blue chip stocks pay over 2   So popular payouts won t get it done  Fortunately  you re talking to one of the guys who   Our Contrarian Income Report portfolio pays 7 2  today it s doable to find these types of yields if you know where to look 
Option 2  Double Your Money Every Few Years  Also with Dividends 
Our strategy here is similar to our first one  except we are prioritizing tomorrow s dividends over today s  So  it is the trajectory of our payouts that is most important 
Why  Because stock prices tend to rise as fast as their dividends 
For example  PepsiCo Inc  NASDAQ PEP   has made its investors rich thanks to its ability to grow its dividend  Check out the orange staircase below that s the payout that PepsiCo hikes every year  Its stock price  blue line below  is attracted to the payout curve like a magnet  Here s their relationship ever since the beverage maker began paying a dividend 
Every Pepsi Payout Refreshes the World




And we can see that over the last five years  its 46  payout growth has perfectly predicted its 46  price gains 
For the Love of It s Dividend 




PepsiCo s payout growth has slowed in recent years as it s filled the market for sugar water  Sub 10  annual dividend growth is unacceptable for true dividend growth investors like us 
PepsiCo s best years of payout growth are behind it  Same goes for many other Dividend Aristocrats  the stocks that have hiked their dividends for 25 or more consecutive years  They are treated like royalty  so their valuations are always high and their current yields are rather low  But it doesn t make sense to reward past accomplishments since the stock market is a forward looking vehicle 
Which is why my Hidden Yields advisory focuses on stocks that are raising their payouts well more than average  I m talking about 18  dividend increases year over year 
The result  Our HY portfolio is up 29 7  year to date  At this rate  our money is going to double in just over two years  And sure  the market is up and that s helped  But we ll gladly  settle  for the 17 4  per year our portfolio has delivered since inception  too 
But  What About a Recession  
Our timely buys are a key ingredient in our secret sauce  And constant recession worries help us out 
Let s rewind to December  when every contrarian indicator was telling us that stocks were ready to rally  While individual investors worried that a 20  decline would snowball into a 40  crash  we saw sentiment at extreme lows and smartly bought not one but two dividend growers on December 21 
The timing was right  as were our picks  Just three days later  the stock market bottomed and began an epic rally that took the S P 24  higher  That was cute  but Mr  Market had nothing on our two purchases  which sprung an average of 51  in just seven months 
How to Make 51  in 7 Months




Now December type opportunities don t happen often  Most of the time  the market meanders between extremes and stocks are neither obvious buys nor sells  You could just as well flip a coin to figure out where shares are likely to head in the short term 
But  it s a weighted coin 
Stocks are better than heads or tails  They go up two thirds of the time  This is why it s important to be fully invested at all times 
The always bearish  gurus  you read elsewhere on the Internet  Their returns are pitiful  They may avoid crashes  but they don t know when to get back in  So they lag us  and they ll never catch up 
That s not an exaggeration  Let s use the last four years as an example  Since we launched HY in the summer of 2015  I ve been hearing from subscribers worried about a repeat of 2008  And hey  I get it we re all 11 years older now and we can t afford a rerun 
But we can t afford to be out of the market  either  Here s why  Any portfolio that s been half in cash since we launched Hidden Yields needed 35  returns from its stock portion to merely keep up with us  Not possible  again  if possible  the person would own the NYSE  
Another reason to stay invested  Fall 2019 could be just like the autumn of 1995  That was the last time the Fed cut interest rates while the stock market was surging 
My pal and finance quant Troy Bombardia considered this and every previous case in which the Fed tossed the markets an  easy money cut   The S P 500 averaged 15 5  returns over the next twelve months 
Rewind to July 1995  The Last  Easy Money  Cut




 Brett  What s the Best Way to Increase Wealth Long Term  
Several subscribers have written in recently asking which dividend strategy is the best one to increase their wealth over the long haul  That s easy  It s Hidden Yields and its 17   yearly returns 
At this rate  we re doubling our money about every four years  We re doing it simply by buying the stocks that are increasing their dividends the fastest  And we re buying without worrying about the bear market boogeyman that unravels most investors 
Remember  for us  bear markets are buying opportunities  December sure was  Our secret was that we didn t panic  We held onto our elite dividend growers and used the opportunity to buy more 
To quote the late  great Eddie Money  many investors  wanna go back  and buy those December bargains  Of course they can t  but you can do the next best thing and buy my seven favorite dividend growers right now 
Don t regret not buying these seven when we revisit these picks months from now  All are poised for fast 50  gains like the two examples we smartly bought in December

176203,397719,PEP,Philadelphia passes soda tax after mayor rewrites playbook,news,"By Luc Cohen NEW YORK  Reuters    Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than 40 U S  public officials who took on the powerful U S  soda industry when the city council voted on Thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks   After a bitter  months long battle  the city council voted 13 4 to approve a 1 5 cent per ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in January  The council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week  and the outcome had not been expected to change   The City of Brotherly Love became the biggest U S  city to have such a tax  Much smaller Berkeley  California  was the first  Similar efforts  including several spearheaded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg  were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the American Beverage Association  which opposes the Philadelphia move and represents Coca Cola Co and PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  Inc   Following Thursday s vote  the ABA said it would take legal action to stop the tax   The Philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes  But experts noted those concerns were not the focus for Kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that  nanny state  public health measures intrude on residents  personal lives  Instead  Kenney rewrote the soda tax advocate s playbook  He played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the city s depleted coffers  In the first year  the tax is projected to raise  91 million  and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre kindergarten   If you want to tax something and people know where the money s going to go  then it s easier for them to get behind it   Kenney said in an interview  He noted that focusing on revenue  rather than health  was largely responsible for the measure s passage   The strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in San Francisco  neighboring Oakland  California  and Boulder  Colorado  Residents of those cities will vote in November on similar taxes  which could deal further blows to a U S  soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption  U S  soda consumption fell for the 11th straight year in 2015  according to Euromonitor data   AVOIDING THE BLOOMBERG TRAP Bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as New York City mayor between 2002 and 2013  He moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants  ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants  On soda  he pushed for a tax  then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps  and finally a much lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks  His efforts were ultimately rejected  with critics decrying the moves toward a  nanny state    The strategy worked in Britain  where a new soft drinks levy was announced in March after officials emphasized the country s obesity crisis  saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state funded health system   That approach never worked in Philadelphia  Michael Nutter  the previous mayor  twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall  He was unable to push it through the city council   Twice before it was used in Philadelphia and it was not successful  It was used in New York and it was not effective   said Kenney  adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not  less important   they are less tangible   Kenney  who became mayor in January  had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre kindergarten  and he kept that issue as his focus  A spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal  Bloomberg personally contributed funding to support Philadelphia s pro tax campaigners   FIZZING WESTWARD Opponents of Philadelphia s soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt Philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda   A spokesman for No Philly Grocery Tax  a local ABA funded group  said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the  unconstitutional  tax  but was still analyzing all its legal options  In a statement  it called the tax  regressive and discriminatory    Kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry    It s the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting  and that s their problem now   Kenney said   You re going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort    In Colorado  Boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs  and San Francisco and Oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention   When Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014  industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the city s largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures  
But Philadelphia is the fifth largest U S  city  with 1 6 million people   No one can trivialize it as they can trivialize Berkeley   said Larry Tramutola  a California political strategist who worked on the Berkeley campaign and is currently leading the San Francisco and Oakland efforts ",2016-06-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/philadelphia-city-council-passes-soda-tax-after-months-long-battle-408907,408907
176204,397720,PEP,Bloomberg looks West after bankrolling Philadelphia soda tax win,news,"By Luc Cohen NEW YORK  Reuters    After successfully funding a campaign to pass a soda tax in Philadelphia  billionaire Michael Bloomberg is preparing to fund similar efforts in several other cities  giving new momentum to measures seeking to limit soft drink consumption  The former New York City mayor contributed the bulk of the money for the pro soda tax side in Philadelphia  providing around  1 6 million  Now the prominent public health crusader will support measures in San Francisco and Oakland  California this year  Howard Wolfson  a senior adviser to Bloomberg  said in a conference call on Friday  Bloomberg may also support soda tax drives in Seattle and Multnomah County in Oregon  which includes Portland  in 2017  Wolfson said   The billionaire s planned backing raises the stakes for the powerful beverage industry  which has lobbied hard to defeat many of the 43 municipal and state level attempts to implement a soda tax that have failed since 2008  Before this week  Berkeley  California was the only U S  city with a soda tax   But the success in Philadelphia  the country s fifth largest city with a diverse population of 1 6 million  could mark a turning point as Americans become more aware of health campaigners  message that sugary soft drinks contribute to obesity and diabetes    If Berkeley was a tremor  Philadelphia is an earthquake  and we expect there will be more earthquakes going forward   Wolfson said   As New York s mayor  Bloomberg led efforts to pass a state level soda tax  prevent residents from buying sodas with food stamps  and limit the size of sugary beverages  His efforts prompted public outcry against what were dubbed  nanny state  initiatives  and all three measures were ultimately defeated  Philadelphia s Mayor Jim Kenney took a different approach  emphasizing the revenue benefits of the tax over the health angle  The city council approved the measure in a 13 4 vote on Thursday after activists raised a total of around  2 million  according to Kevin Feeley  who led the pro tax campaign   Feeley and Wolfson both said the soda industry outspent the pro tax campaign   A spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association  ABA   which represents Coca Cola Co and PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  and funded a local group opposing the tax  said the group did not yet have a final tally for how much it spent  The spokeswoman added that the group would  oppose all discriminatory tax proposals   The group has said the tax s passage in Philadelphia was the result of unique local political conditions and unlikely to have a ripple effect in other cities   The ABA said on Thursday it would sue Philadelphia to stop the tax  and Wolfson did not rule out the possibility that Bloomberg would contribute to aid the city s defense   Wolfson declined to specify an amount that Bloomberg was willing to spend on the San Francisco and Oakland efforts  but noted that he was  not in a position to match soda dollar for dollar   Bloomberg s contributions are meant to help  level the playing field   he said

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors

including cost savings  long term innovation  and the revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  Also  the company is witnessing strong shipments and depletion growth All these factors helped the company to deliver robust second quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings and sales outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year  Notably  this marked the company s fourth straight earnings beat  with positive sales surprise in three of the last four quarters  As a result  management raised its 2019 guidance for earnings  shipments and depletions   Read   We note that  shares of this Boston  MA based company have gained approximately 44  in the past six months  outpacing the  s growth of 5 4  Further  analysts are steadily growing bullish on the stock  This is apparent from the rise in earnings estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current and next financial year has moved north by 34 cents and 36 cents to  8 93 and  10 09  respectively All said  let s take a closer look at the aspects driving this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock Factors Narrating Boston Beer s Growth StoryBoston Beer has been witnessing sturdy depletion growth for a while now  which is aiding the top line performance  In second quarter 2019  revenues grew 16 61  on 17  improvement in shipments and depletions  Depletions benefited from major innovations  quality of products and strong brands alongside solid sales execution and support from distributors  Moreover  strength in Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands aided depletion growth  which was partly offset by fall in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands Management updated its guidance for 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of the Dogfish Head business and robust trends witnessed for the Truly brand in the first half  which aided depletions growth  Including Dogfish Head acquisition  the company now estimates shipments and depletion growth of 17 22   up from 10 15  stated earlier  Excluding this  shipments and depletions growth are expected to be 13 18  Also  the company expects to consolidate the Dogfish Head into its financial results starting Jul 3  2019  In the second half of 2019  Dogfish Head is anticipated to contribute about 3 4  in Boston Beer s annual shipments and depletions growth  Further  it is likely to add about  50  60 million in the company s net revenues  with gross margin of roughly 50   It expects Dogfish Head s operating expenses to be  20  25 million in the second half of 2019  including transaction related costs and other non recurring expenses of about  8 million  of which  1 5 million were spent in the first half  Excluding these costs  the Dogfish Head merger is likely to be neutral to slightly accretive to Boston Beer s earnings per share in 2019 For 2019  the company envisions adjusted earnings per share of  8 30  9 30  up from  8 00  9 00 mentioned earlier Apart from these  Boston Beer remains committed to the three point growth plan  which is focused on the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands  cost saving initiatives  and long term innovation  Firstly  it plans to revive the Samuel Adams brand through packaging  innovation  promotion and brand communication initiatives  Further  it remains keen on retaining Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea s momentum while ensuring Truly Spiked   Sparkling s leadership position in the hard sparkling water category  Secondly  the company is focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects with savings directed for further brand development  As a result  it continues to anticipate improvement in the gross margin by one percentage point every year through 2019  Its third priority is long term innovation and maximizing the shareholder value  Boston Beer remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories Wrapping UpHowever  higher operating expenses and lower gross margin due to increased processing costs at third party breweries are partly denting earnings growth  In the second quarter  the company s gross margin contracted 210 basis points  bps  due to elevated processing costs stemming from increased production at third party breweries and higher temporary labor at company owned breweries to maintain increased variety pack volume Although  the company raised depletions view  it notes that increased volumes for the brands are attracting higher costs due to the use of third party breweries  which is likely to hurt its gross margin in 2019  It anticipates gross margin of 50 51   Moreover  softness in the Samuel Adams brand also remains a major headwind Nevertheless  we expect the aforementioned growth drivers to offset these hurdles and help the Boston Beer stock to sustain its solid momentum Want Other Top Ranked Beverage Stocks

 Reuters    Twitter Inc named PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  Inc Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston and Martha Lane Fox  co founder of travel website lastminute com  to its board on Friday in its latest management shakeup 
The appointments  which take effect immediately  came as board members Peter Currie and Peter Chernin decided not to stand for re election  Twitter said in a regulatory filing  The terms of Currie  the president of a private investment firm  and Chernin  a Hollywood executive  are set to expire at the company s annual meeting in May 
Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey tweeted that other directors would be appointed soon   ones that will bring diversity and represent the strong communities on Twitter  This matters   is a must  
Twitter has tried to freshen its board since January as it has been criticized for lacking diversity and innovative ideas  Many of its 10 board members have served for several years 
 You need greater turnover than just these two and ideally bring in some media figures   said Monness  Crespi  Hardt   Co analyst James Cakmak   Almost everybody needs to turn over  and these two are just a start

176260,397776,PEP,Earnings Winners Could Put Money In Your Pocket For Years To Come,opinion,"It s hard to believe  but it s that time again 
PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  is already out of the gate with strong numbers on the back of snack and beverage sales  especially in higher growth beverage categories  I mean energy drinks like Mountain Dew Game Fuel  and Bubly sparkling water 
That said  this upcoming batch of quarterly reports is widely expected to be a downer  with the average decline in earnings coming in at 2 6  according to FactSet data 
If that s where the scorecard finishes  it ll be the second straight quarter of declines year over year  By comparison  the average estimated earnings decline was just 0 5   so this is potentially a big deal 
I say  potentially  because mainstream analysts had the same sort of doom and gloom in mind last quarter  and the numbers were stronger than most folks expected   as was the S P 500 
Anybody betting on a decline got left on the proverbial bench  caught flatfooted by a market that ran away from them 
And as Chief Investment Strategist  I don t ever want that to happen to you  so listen up 
Here s How To Capture All The Upside
Here s the thing  I believe that earnings will once again be stronger than most people expect  which means you want to be  in to win  if you re serious about profits like I am 
I also believe there will be serious split developing between companies that meet or beat expectations and those that don t 
Technology  healthcare  defense   these are all areas where there s still strong growth  so they re likely to reap stronger future earnings  On the other hand  I see revenue and earnings getting tighter for retailers  and companies incapable of leaning into the future 
Effectively  they re a value trap for unsuspecting investors 
That s something we don t have to worry about  with our money positioned nicely ahead of tomorrow s growth 
For instance  IDC estimates that 60  of the worlds  GDP will be  digitized  by 2022  At the same time  75  of all IT spending will be on third party platforms  which means companies providing integrated data management will monetize fastest 
In fact  the IDC also estimates that 90  or more of all enterprises will build digital native IT environments with specific focus on cloud centric services  leveraging on site legacy systems and plugging into consumer data 
That means the average investor could probably double their exposure to data related firms and still not have enough 
So right now  you need to do three things 
Forget about the Fed and its rate cut  Instead  focus on the Unstoppable Trends and companies that are making  must have  products that dovetail with that  That s how you ll keep the wind in your sails as opposed to against you if I m wrong and the numbers stink or volatility rears its ugly head 


Be prepared to cut the slackers from your portfolio   immediately and with no looking back  Be ruthless and unsentimental  because any company that doesn t hit its numbers will be pounded mercilessly  and there s nothing you can do about that except move on  Even if you have to take a few lumps here and there  better to do it on your own terms  or a professional trader will separate you from your money to add it to their pile 


Make a list of  buys  that you ll swoop in and buy if given the chance  Some of my favorites include defense plays  cybersecurity  healthcare  and even digital money providers  and I DO NOT mean Bitcoin   I m talking Visa  NYSE V   which is still very inexpensive even at  180 62 a share 
As always  I will be with you every step of the way

176275,397791,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"PepsiCo  PEP  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 54 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 49 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 61 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 36   A quarter ago  it was expected that this food and beverage company would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 97  delivering a surprise of 5 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
PepsiCo  which belongs to the Zacks Beverages   Soft drinks industry  posted revenues of  16 45 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 36   This compares to year ago revenues of  16 09 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
PepsiCo shares have added about 20  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 7  
What s Next for PepsiCo 
While PepsiCo has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for PepsiCo was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 54 on  16 95 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 51 on  66 47 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Beverages   Soft drinks is currently in the bottom 15  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico-pep-beats-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200437967,200437967
176276,397792,PEP,Risk Off As Markets Await Powell  Oil  Gold  Bitcoin,opinion,"Financial markets remain on edge ahead of Fed Chair Powell s crucial two days of House Congressional testimony that will begin on Wednesday  Friday s robust employment report  along with today s better than expected NFIB Small Business Optimism survey continue to highlight the labor market remains unusual strong this late in the 11 year long economic cycle  Powell is expected to keep the case for cutting rates open  but he could dash hopes for those expecting hints that we will see a commitment for more than one rate cut this year  This morning  Powell will also provide opening remarks at a Boston Fed conference on stress tests 
Overnight  risk aversion remained the dominant theme after BASF  the world s largest chemical maker cut their 2019 forecast because of the trade war  While a cut was expected by many analysts  the slashing of the 2019 EBIT forecast by 30  was considerably lower than what was feared  The global automotive industry downturn was particularly strong and markets will not see any relief until we see the US fully address the trade spat with Europe  which they are likely to do once they wrap up the trade war with China 
In Asia  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam gave an interview to state that the China extradition bill is dead  The decision  however  is not a formal withdrawal of the bill and may be too late to derail Hong Kong protesters who want it completely withdrawn and are seeking democracy for Hong Kong  Lam could decide to bring back the bill with 12 days  notice and that risk is likely to keep the weeks long protests going strong 
As markets await the next update on the trade front  the situation remains tense between China and the US  Taiwan is set to acquire  2 billion of US weapons  in what China is claiming is a violation of international law 
US stocks markets are off the lows of the day after Pepsico  NASDAQ PEP  earnings delivered a slight beat that saw beverage seller affirm their 2019 targets  Treasury yields are slightly higher  with the 10 year yield up 1 0 basis point to 2 058   The dollar is up against its major trading partners with the biggest gains against the British pound and Aussie dollar 

Oil
Crude prices are likely to see some support on fears of further tanker attacks or seizures in the Persian Gulf  Yesterday  a BP  LON BP  oil tanker that was due to travel from Iraq to Europe decided to stay put in fear that they could get seized by Iran 
Oil markets are also eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Powell s testimony to Congress  which will provide confirmation the end of month meeting is live and that they will remain data dependent on how deep they will take this upcoming rate cutting cycle 
Commodity prices could see a strong move following Powell if focus on deflationary risks and triggers a dollar reversal 

Gold
The strong dollar is temporarily derailing the bullion rally  The yellow metal is now down  50 from the June 25th high of  1 442 90  Gold was ripe for a pullback and buyers will welcome the current pullback  Even if Powell is not dovish enough with this week s testimony  gold should find strong support around the  1 370 region 

Bitcoin
Cryptocurrencies are here to stay  US regulators have made progress in outlining how current securities rules will apply to digital tokens  The crypto space is likely to get crowded and we will see large financial institution launch their own competing coins in the very near future  Bitcoin will benefit from this increased regulation and should see further bullish momentum

176288,397804,PEP,In Myanmar on cusp of change  former junta  crony  sees business as usual,news,By Hnin Yadana Zaw and Antoni Slodkowski YANGON  Reuters    Aung San Suu Kyi s landslide election win might be bad news for Myanmar businessmen like construction magnate Khin Shwe  who lost his parliament seat and remains barred from doing business with U S  nationals due to his ties to the former junta  Or maybe not  Sitting comfortably on a beige leather sofa in his plush Yangon office next to a large portrait of himself  Khin Shwe says he is in a pole position to team up with the global investors who will be lured by Suu Kyi s clean image and a renewed reform push   When the investments come in  there is no one else apart from us  the  cronies   who will be able to work on the same level as the foreign investors   Khin Shwe told Reuters  in a rare interview with an international media organization  Myanmar s junta ceded power in 2011 to President Thein Sein s semi civilian government  beginning a reform drive that delivered record foreign investment and improvements in key sectors of the economy  Four years on  however  Myanmar s telecoms  tourism  construction and banking sectors are still largely in the hands of some 20 wealthy and well connected families with ties to military backed enterprises  A new influx of investment could boost their coffers  making it harder for start ups and nimbler competitors to grow and compete and ensuring many of the old order maintain their sway over large sections of the economy even after their political representation in parliament was all but wiped out  Khin Shwe  who lost a battle for re election to parliament on the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party  USDP  ticket  is on a U S  blacklist due to his ties with Khin Nyunt  a once feared former intelligence chief and prime minister  But  after staking a part of his foreign policy legacy on supporting Myanmar s democratic transition  U S  President Barack Obama may now ease some of the remaining sanctions   Sat behind a desk cluttered with golden statues and surrounded by certificates of charitable activities  Khin Shwe said he expected sanctions to be relaxed   If they keep the sanctions on the people  who will they form joint ventures with when they come in   he said   The investors can t come and negotiate with a street vendor over business  They have to remove us from the blacklist   STRONG GROWTH SEEN With Western investors mostly on the sidelines  companies from Asia have led the charge into Myanmar  boosting foreign direct investment to  8 billion in fiscal 2014 15  more than five times the flows recorded just two years earlier  That may now accelerate after the clear mandate for change delivered in the Nov  8 election  the first free poll in a quarter of a century   Many investors slowed down investments before the election   said Thitipong Tangpoonphonvivat  CEO of Thai based General Engineering Pcl  which is building a steel pipe factory in Myanmar with Millcon Steel to capitalize on expected demand for infrastructure projects   But after the election  there is more clarity about the political picture that reflects Myanmar is willing to open the country  We can see strong growth in GDP and trade numbers   The handful of Western multinationals that have set up in Myanmar include PepsiCo  N PEP  Inc  Coca Cola and GE  which are working with local distribution partners  More may soon follow  To be sure  many potential investors are uncertain about Suu Kyi s economic policies  Thant Zin Tun  executive director of Carlsberg  CO CARLa  Myanmar and director of LOTTE MGS Beverage Co  producer of Pepsi in Myanmar  said there were also concerns about the lack of business experience in her team   She will work with her own organization  she will work with her own administration  she will work with the top management people   he said   But I just want to know  how many does she have   Still  Sean Turnell  an expert on Myanmar s economy at Sydney s Macquarie University  thinks Suu Kyi s decisive win that allows her to govern without needing to build coalitions will have a  hugely  positive impact   This is someone who is very Western minded  very much attached to the rule of law  sound institutions  property rights and all that and she s calling the shots now   said Turnell  who also informally advises Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy  NLD  on economic policy   This brings stability that would be favorable exactly for that kind of investor who stayed on the sidelines until now   BUILDING BRIDGES Khin Shwe s Zaykabar Ltd conglomerate reported about  20 million in profits last year and opened a new office tower in Yangon about a month before the election  Apart from owning a prime real estate portfolio  Zaykabar runs the upmarket Karaweik Palace   a gold painted barge that dominates a lake at the heart of Yangon and was the restaurant of choice for Myanmar s generals during the junta years  Khin Shwe is related by marriage to former USDP boss Shwe Mann  who was purged by President Thein Sein in August  and the two men have close business ties  Like Shwe Mann  Khin Shwe is now distancing himself from the outgoing president  who he says became  afraid of the cronies   and is seeking to build bridges with the democracy champion  calling her  A ma gyi  or  Big Sister     This is an outcome vital for correcting our poor image as an investment destination  Everybody around the world knows her face  so we can t miss this opportunity   said Khin Shwe    That s why I put my trust in Aung San Suu Kyi  I am genuinely happy that the NLD is forming the new government

176292,397808,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"PepsiCo  PEP  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 9  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 5  
Revenues are expected to be  16 39 billion  up 1 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 22  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo 
For PepsiCo  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that PepsiCo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 97  delivering a surprise of  5 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PepsiCo appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico-pep-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q2-release-200436508,200436508

176314,397830,PEP,Big palm oil s pledge to preserve forests vexes Indonesia,news,"By Michael Taylor JAKARTA  Reuters    The Indonesian government is asking major palm oil companies to row back on the historic  no deforestation  pledges they made at last year s United Nations climate change summit  officials and company sources say  Major palm oil companies were invited to a series of meetings at the economics ministry last week  where officials expressed concern the pledges the plantation companies made are causing big problems for smaller palm oil firms in their supply chain  the sources told Reuters  The government has asked palm oil firms who signed the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge  IPOP  to exempt smallholders because they are not yet ready to practice the same level of sustainable forest practices as the big players  said Musdhalifah Machmud  deputy minister for food and agriculture at the coordinating ministry for economic affairs    Yah  they need to let smallholders fulfill their trade   she told Reuters  Indonesia is the world s biggest palm oil producer and exporter and its industry employs nearly 5 million workers  A top official at one of the major palm oil companies  who did not want to be named  said the companies  received guidance notes  from ministry officials  PALM OIL STIGMA A representative of an environmental group said the government is urging big palm oil firms to  water their stance down  by urging them to continue to buy palm oil from their suppliers  even if that company is cutting down forests for new plantations   This would pretty much ruin the whole attempt to create an industry wide no deforestation situation to remove the stigma from Indonesian palm oil   the NGO representative said  The pressure from the national government comes after local governments in Indonesia have begun taking away concessions from palm oil companies who tried to convert them into conservation forests  several big palm oil companies told Reuters  The controversy over the IPOP pledges is arising as the Indonesia government comes under mounting pressure from its neighbors over the smoky haze from forest fires that has blanketed much of Southeast Asia the past month  Plantation firms who use  slash and burn  techniques to clear forests   most of them smallholders now   are one of the biggest reasons for the fires  Home to the world s third largest tropical forests   and the world s fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases mainly due to their destruction   Indonesia will be one of the countries in the spotlight at December s U N  climate change conference in Paris  The meeting will try to get legally binding commitments from the 190 member nations to slash greenhouse gases  SUPERMARKET PRODUCTS The spectacular growth of palm oil plantations over the past quarter century  now covering over 11 million hectares in Indonesia or an area bigger than Iceland  has been a leading cause of deforestation   Cheaper than other vegetable oils and low in trans fat acids  palm oil has increasingly found its way into products throughout the supermarket  most commonly as cooking oil  but also everything from snack foods and chocolates to soaps and soup   Around five years ago environmental activists began pressuring some of the world s biggest consumer goods companies to demand their palm oil suppliers adopt more sustainable forestry practices  They organized demonstrations outside suburban U S  supermarkets  A prime time documentary in April 2014 featured an angry Harrison Ford  clutching an orangutan on a visit to peat forests in Indonesia being clear cut for plantations  Activists and media reports began highlighting the use of child workers and forced labor on some plantations  The campaign worked  In September of last year  all the major Indonesian palm oil companies signed a  No Deforestation  No Peat  No Exploitation  pledge  Together  they and their supply chains controlled well over half the global palm oil trade  Indonesia s two biggest timber and paper companies  Asia Pacific Resources International Ltd and Asia Pulp and Paper have signed similar forestry sustainability pledges  Greenpeace  which in 2010 had launched a YouTube video against Nestle for buying palm oil from a subsidiary of Singapore based Golden Agri Resources  then joined hands with their former arch villains to help them implement the pledges  It seemed like a turning point in the battle against climate change  MONITORING COMPLIANCE After the cascading movement of companies and their customers to adopt deforestation pledges  environmental activists and some of the companies themselves  set up online platforms to monitor compliance with their IPOP pledges  Wilmar International Ltd  the world s largest palm oil trader  unveiled an online platform this year that provides transparency and  traceability  into its supply chain  including the names and locations of refineries and palm oil mills   Wilmar is the first agro industrial giant to offer a way to follow palm oil all the way back to the mills where the oil is processed   says Scott Poynton of The Forest Trust  a forestry activist group  which brokered Wilmar s zero deforestation policy and built the online dashboard  Rainforest Action Network started a  Snackfood 20 Scorecard  that monitors the implementation of deforestation pledges by companies that buy palm oil from major plantation firms for their products  such as PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  Inc   Kellogg Co and Kraft Heinz Co  The speed and alacrity with which the major plantation companies began enforcing their  no deforestation  pledges   which also apply to companies in their supply chain   caught both the national government and smaller growers by surprise  Efforts by big palm oil firms to convert concessions into protected forests have run into roadblocks at the local government level  CONFLICT OVER CONCESSIONS When Golden Agri  one of the IPOP companies  tried to convert an area designated for plantations in Indonesian Borneo into a conservation forest  the local government threatened to revoke the concession  said Agus Purnomo  the company s director for strategic stakeholders agreement  He said the company was still negotiating with officials in the Kapuas Hulu district of West Kalimantan   If we are not developing it into plantations  they cancel  the concession  and give it to somebody else   a competitor   said Purnomo  a former director at WWF Indonesia and a presidential advisor on climate change  Officials in Kapuas Hulu could not be reached for comment  Wilmar and unlisted Singapore based palm oil firm Musim Mas told Reuters they  too  had experienced problems similar to that of Golden Agri  The conflict over whether concessions should be planted or preserved reflects a major policy dilemma in Indonesia  The forests are a prime source of employment and development in the world s fourth most populous country  but their rapid depletion has economic as well as environmental consequences  ENCROACHING ON POLICY Palm oil is a key driver of economic growth in Indonesia  said Machmud at the economics ministry  And growth is slowing  Indonesia s GDP is expected to decline to 4 9 percent this year from above 6 percent over the last decade   Part of our country we have to protect for forests  and the other part we have to do some economic activity so the people around it can improve their prosperity   she said  The no deforestation pledges made by the big palm oil companies are putting smallholders at risk  she said   My concern is  small  farmers cannot sell   said Machmud   The entire supply chain cannot do something that is not allowed by IPOP   Moreover  IPOP was never coordinated with the government and encroaches on government policy and guidelines  she said  The problem  she said  is that companies like Golden Agri are setting aside forests in their concession area for preservation that the government has already assigned for development   If you don t like it  no problem   she said   Another company will come to develop it   It s a stance that makes environmental groups unhappy  The biggest palm oil and timber companies in Indonesia have all committed to the  no deforestation  pledge and now they were losing concessions when they try to preserve forests  said Bustar Maitar  head of Greenpeace s campaign to save the forests in Indonesia   This is enough to gain the momentum to tell the government that business as usual has already passed   he said  HAZY POLICY Caught in the middle is Nur Masripatin  appointed in June to the new role of director general in charge of climate change policy within the newly merged environment and forestry ministry  The government has had competing aims around development and conservation  she said in an interview  and her job is to help coordinate those priorities between different ministries  The previous president  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono took a high profile approach to climate change policy because he  was more  about  exposing this country to the world   she said   Our new president really wants to focus on developing the country and especially improving the welfare of the poor   The environment and forestry ministry can do little about the conflicts over whether to preserve or develop forests in concession area  she added  because land use comes under the purview of the agricultural ministry  It puts Indonesia in an awkward position in trying to defend its efforts to fight the forest fires   and the smothering haze it engenders   with its enraged neighbors  Malaysia s prime minister on Monday demanded that Indonesia take action against those setting fires in the forests  Smallholder companies seeking to clear land for palm oil and pulp wood plantations have been accused of setting the fires that smolder for weeks in underground peat deposits in Sumatra and Indonesia s part of Borneo island  
Indonesia s Vice President Jusuf Kalla said his country had no need to apologize for a month or so of fire and haze each year   Look at how long they have enjoyed fresh air from our green environment and forests when there were no fires   he said during a dialogue session with Indonesians in New York in late September   Could be months  Are they grateful  ",2015-10-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/big-palm-oil's-pledge-to-preserve-forests-vexes-indonesia-364913,364913

Valuation  Reducing leverage and sustained growth should narrow discount
Britvic trades at a consensus FY19e P E of 15 9x  a 37  discount to the UK beverages sector  and a 45  discount to AG Barr  calendarised   reflecting its geared balance sheet  partial ownership structure and steady earnings growth  However  we believe that with sustained earnings and income delivery  and reducing balance sheet leverage  those discounts should narrow

176350,397866,PEP,Special Report  When it comes to e cigs  Big Tobacco is concerned for your health,news,"By Martinne Geller LONDON  Reuters    The health warning on a MarkTen electronic cigarette package is 116 words long  That s much longer than the warnings on traditional cigarette packs in the United States  Nicotine  the e cigarette warning says  is  addictive and habit forming  and it is very toxic by inhalation  in contact with the skin  or if swallowed   It is not intended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding  or people     who take medicine for depression or asthma   Nicotine can increase your heart rate and blood pressure and cause dizziness  nausea and stomach pain   says MarkTen  a leading brand in the United States  The ingredients can be  poisonous   MarkTen s parent company Altria  maker of Marlboro cigarettes  said the language seemed appropriate  There is no required health warning on electronic cigarettes in the United States  so  we had to do what we thought was right   said a spokesman for Altria Client Services  The company s frankness about the perils of nicotine dates back to the late 1990s  when it led a campaign for cigarettes to be regulated by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   Small tobacco companies at the time said the big guys would use regulation to seal their dominance  Today  small e cigarette makers are saying the same thing  Many argue that firms like Altria and Reynolds American  NYSE RAI  want hefty rules to help neutralize the threat that e cigarettes pose to their businesses  By accentuating the risks of  vaping   they say  big firms may deter smokers from trying the new devices  even though most scientists agree they are safer   If you read that  warning  as a smoker  you might think  Oh  I ll just stick with a cigarette    said Oliver Kershaw  a former 15 a day smoker who quit through e cigarettes and founded websites that advocate them  Big tobacco companies have pushed for a range of controls on e cigarettes  These include lengthy health warnings  reduced product ranges  restricted sales  and scientific testing requirements  Kershaw and others say such efforts risk squeezing small players  Too many rules would stifle innovation and reduce the range of products to  a very simple  utilitarian e cigarette   said Fraser Cropper  CEO of Totally Wicked  an independent e cigarette company based in the UK   Big tobacco companies say their goal in pushing for firm control is not to hurt smaller competitors  Regulation will benefit consumers and e cigarette companies alike by ensuring safety and quality standards and boosting confidence  they say  Small companies should not be exempt from responsible behavior    Our stated goal is to get to e vapor leadership  to have the strongest brands in the marketplace   said the Altria spokesman  He could not predict the impact of increased regulation on smaller firms   I don t know how they run their businesses and what it would cost them to meet those requirements   Most anti tobacco campaigners agree that e cigarettes should be regulated  But some believe they deserve a lighter touch than tobacco because they can help smokers quit  and may be less harmful than smoking  Measures that make e cigarettes less appealing or hard to come by may keep people smoking  these people say  Clive Bates  a former head of UK charity Action on Smoking and Health  ASH   thinks public health officials who advocate tough controls end up helping Big Tobacco s conventional brands   They really are all doing their utmost to protect the cigarette trade   Bates said   They just don t realize it   He thinks regulations should encourage smokers to quit  or switch  The image of e cigarettes is already changing  The proportion of people in Britain who think vaping is just as harmful as smoking doubled last year to 15 percent  according to a survey by ASH  In the United States  a similar picture is emerging  The growth in U S  sales of e cigarettes slowed to 5 percent in the fourth quarter last year from 19 percent a year earlier  according to  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst Bonnie Herzog  She attributes that partly to increased uncertainty about the products  Derek Yach  a director at Vitality Institute  a health research company  doubts there is any  conspiratorial effort  to crush the new business  But he says that  if the dominant message is one of doubt  then the status quo gets maintained   Yach once headed tobacco control at the World Health Organization and worked at PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Japan Tobacco International  the world s third largest tobacco company  thinks strict regulations could hurt young firms   If you make it extremely hard  to comply   you would drive small companies out of business   said Ian Jones  JTI s head of scientific and regulatory affairs for emerging products   You would lose the value of the category  you would lose the spark    OPEN SYSTEMS  E cigarettes came onto the market a decade ago promising a safer nicotine fix  The devices heat nicotine laced liquid to create an inhalable vapor  rather than burn tobacco  That gives smokers the traditional hand to mouth ritual without the deadly smoke  The global vaping market  which could top  7 billion this year  is evenly split between cigarette look alikes  often sold by tobacco companies  and refillable  vapors  tanks and mods    devices which users modify to suit their needs  These are often made by smaller firms  Demand for them is growing three times as fast as the overall market  as users say they find them more satisfying than early all in one models  Serious devotees favor such refillable  open systems  that let them mix and match liquids and batteries to vary their nicotine intake  Open systems are often sold in vape shops and lend an edgy  do it yourself creativity to the vaping community  According to Wells Fargo  there are now around 8 500 vape shops in the United States and 19 400 globally  Vape shops account for about one third of all U S  sales  while the Internet accounts for another third   In August  Reynolds   which does not produce mods   urged the FDA to  ban open system e cigarettes  including all component parts   Such systems  Reynolds wrote  present a  unique risk for adulteration  tampering and quality control   If the FDA does not want a ban  Reynolds suggested  it should regulate vape shops as manufacturers  That would subject them to FDA inspection  registration  manufacturing standards and product clearance requirements  Vape shops often mix nicotine and flavoring  just as pharmacies compound drugs  said Richard Smith  communications manager at Reynolds  This means  the vape shop seller is a manufacturer under the applicable laws and regulations   E cigarette independents say such a move targets them  analysts note that the business model of big tobacco firms depends on mass production  not mix and match   I think they  Reynolds  probably want that snuffed out before it gains traction   said Philip Gorham  an Amsterdam based tobacco analyst at Morningstar   Reynolds says that s not true   We fully support innovation in tobacco products  including vapor products   said Smith  The company wants  a level playing field where all manufacturers are subject to equal treatment   DOING THEIR DUTY Shane MacGuill  a tobacco analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International  said Reynolds  move may seem zealous  but companies have a duty to shareholders   It would be remiss     of them not to try and push for the competitive environment that is as favorable to them as possible   Steven Parrish  a former Altria executive who retired in 2008  said that as long as people are honest  there s nothing wrong with advocating to protect their interests  And embracing regulation can help the tobacco industry win trust   I think one of the things the industry would like to see     is a world in which the tobacco industry is much more like the pharmaceutical industry in terms of how it operates   he said   Very heavily regulated and maybe not loved and admired  but at least acknowledged as a legitimate business   That makes young people a particularly sensitive point of tension  Most e cigarette companies want tighter controls on who can buy  such as a minimum age  Altria s NuMark goes further  It says U S  purchases should also be  clerk assisted or conducted in an otherwise non self service environment    Smaller e cigarette makers say that would hand a big advantage to tobacco companies  U S  convenience stores are the main outlets for tobacco products  Tobacco firms offer the stores rich incentives to promote their brands  and according to Morningstar  tobacco can provide more than a third of stores  profit  Cigarettes can only be sold behind the counter  They are displayed on heavily branded shelving which the tobacco firms often provide  Putting e cigarettes behind the counter would force the products to compete for consumer attention in space that tobacco firms influence  small companies say   As long as you say it has to be 12 feet from a child s hand at the counter  it guarantees  the e cigarette  gets onto their wall   said Jan Verleur  CEO and co founder of VMR  a Miami based e cigarette company   Altria says retailers choose how and where to display products  EARLY WARNINGS Some small e cig firms are pushing back  Totally Wicked is challenging Europe s Tobacco Products Directive  TPD   which was adopted in 2014 and comes into force in 2016   It s up to member states to apply the EU rules in their own way  but the directive says manufacturers must tell regulators what s in a new product six months before launch  Producers will have to list ingredients  emissions  toxicological data  nicotine doses and uptake  as well as health effects  A new notification is required for every big change   Totally Wicked is fighting the TPD in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg  Such detailed reporting is more onerous even than for traditional cigarettes  the company argues  It says it is disproportionate  considering that e cigarettes are probably less harmful  Its CEO says the six month notification would slow innovation in an industry where manufacturers can move from concept to shelf in 10 weeks  British American Tobacco s Nicoventures unit agrees with Totally Wicked that the six month notice period  runs the risk of stifling innovation   according to a spokeswoman  But global tobacco leader Philip Morris International  NYSE PM    which used to be part of Altria   said it thinks this kind of advance notification is appropriate to ensure standards  Its own tests already go beyond the TPD rules  a spokeswoman said  Robust scientific research is  something we believe in as the core of our work in this new product category   In the United States  the FDA aims to deliver its final ruling on e cigarettes in June  E cigarette firms there say anything that requires lengthy and costly trials could be manageable for big business but may hurt smaller companies   The more science that s required  the more expensive it becomes   said Sanjiv Desai  general counsel of U S  e cigarette firm VMR  A spokesman for the FDA said it was weighing the burden on everyone  including small manufacturers  It plans to help small companies by phasing in new rules  The European Union also plans to give firms time to adapt  It has said clear rules will help smaller firms  it plans to assess the costs of notification  
For Yach  the former WHO tobacco official  regulators should remember that e cigarettes are more than a new business   A heavy smoker has a 20 times greater risk of lung cancer   Yach said   Switch to e cigarettes and that risk is virtually going to zero    Edited by Sara Ledwith ",2015-03-23,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/special-report:-when-it-comes-to-e-cigs,-big-tobacco-is-concerned-for-your-health-333657",333657

176359,397875,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at PepsiCo  PEP   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  PepsiCo currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PEP that show why this food and beverage company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For PEP  shares are up 0 27  over the past week while the Zacks Beverages   Soft drinks industry is down 0 58  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 08  compares favorably with the industry s 1 54  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of PepsiCo have risen 9 9   and are up 31 62  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 3 77  and 5 92   respectively 
Investors should also take note of PEP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  PEP is averaging 3 834 332 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with PEP 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PEP s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 50 to  5 51 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that PEP is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep PepsiCo on your short list ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico-pep-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200421726,200421726
176360,397876,PEP,3 Reasons Why You Must Hold On To AB InBev  BUD  Stock For Now,opinion,"Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV   NYSE BUD    alias AB InBev  has been displaying strength lately  owing to robust sales trends  persistent growth of global brands and strong outlook for 2019  The company is witnessing robust sales growth on the back of improving trends in key markets and continued premiumization in the majority of its markets  Further  the three global brands   Budweiser  Corona and Stella Artois   continue to witness solid growth Driven by these positives  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has gained 26 1  year to date  outperforming the  s growth of 18 2  
 
However  we cannot ignore softness in the U S  beer industry  and tough macroeconomic conditions in Argentina and South Africa  which remain headwinds  Further  currency headwinds and commodity cost inflation continue to weigh on the bottom line Let s delve deeper and find out reasons why we should retain this stock now Strong Global Brands   PremiumizationIn first quarter 2019  consolidated revenues for the AB InBev s global brands improved 8 5  globally and 14  outside their respective home markets  Budweiser witnessed revenue growth of more than 15  outside the United States  driven by strong growth in China  Brazil  the U K  and Colombia  Corona  the most premium global brand  sustained its growth momentum  with revenues improving 15 7  outside its home country  Mexico  Most of this growth was driven by strength in Brazil  Colombia  the U K   China and Canada  Stella Artois revenues grew 8   aided by double digit revenue growth in more than 30 countries  including Brazil  South Korea and Mexico Furthermore  AB InBev s High End Company delivered revenue growth of nearly 20   Strength in global brands reflects the company s potential to grow  backed by improving trends in key markets and continued premiumization in the majority of its markets Robust Top Line Performance   OutlookIn first quarter 2019  AB InBev delivered the second straight sales beat and its fifth positive sales surprise in the trailing six quarters  Moreover  the company registered organic revenue growth of 5 9   courtesy of 4 6  rise in revenues per hectoliter  hl  and strong volume growth  Top line results were also aided by global premiumization and ongoing revenue management initiatives  Further  healthy performances in key markets   including Brazil  China  the United States  Europe  Colombia and Nigeria   boosted the top line  Total organic volume advanced 1 3   with own beer volume rising 1  and non beer volume up 4 9  Furthermore  the company anticipates delivering strong top line and EBITDA growth for 2019  backed by solid brand performance and robust commercial plans  Driven by increased focus on category development  it expects to deliver balanced top line growth between volume and revenue per hl   Net revenue per hl growth is likely to exceed inflation while costs  sum of cost of sales and SG A  are expected to be below inflation  Premiumization and revenue management initiatives are likely to aid revenue per hl growth Cost Savings on TrackAB InBev is on track to reach its synergy and cost savings target of  3 2 billion that was announced in August 2016  following the acquisition of SABMiller  LON SAB   Of this  nearly  547 million was reported by SABMiller as of Mar 31  2016  and about  2 491 million was captured between Apr 1  2016  and Mar 31  2019  Clearly  the company has captured about  3 038 million of synergies since the announcement  Capture of synergies and cost savings in the first quarter were nearly  100 million  mainly driven by business integration efforts  The company expects to achieve the remaining synergies of nearly  150 million by the end of 2019 What Holds Us BackDespite strong top line performance graph  the company is persistently witnessing lower than expected bottom line results due to adverse currency translations and commodity cost inflation  First quarter 2019 marked its third straight earnings miss and fourth negative surprise in the last six quarters  Higher commodity costs mainly stemmed from increased aluminum and barley prices  Additionally  cost of sales increased 6  organically while cost of sales per hl grew 4 6  For 2019  the company projects cost of sales per hl to increase in a mid single digit as currency and commodity headwinds will only be partly offset by the cost management initiatives Additionally  some of the company s key markets  particularly Argentina and South Africa  continued to suffer from tough macroeconomic conditions in the first quarter  which led to lower consumer demand   In South Africa  revenues were hurt by lower volume  which stemmed from the shift of the Easter holiday to the second quarter of this year  alongside lower consumer demand  Ongoing macroeconomic challenges and a continued segment mix shift toward the premium segment  where the region still has lower market share  impacted consumer demand  In Argentina  volume declined in mid

176384,397900,PEP,U S  consumer sentiment pulls off 11 year high,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in February from an 11 year high amid worries over slowing economic growth  suggesting a recent weakness in spending might last for a while 
The ebb in sentiment came despite strong job gains over the last three months  signs of an acceleration in wage growth as well as cheaper gasoline prices  factors that economists had expected would buoy consumer spending in the months ahead 
 As it stands  the pullback in confidence  along with the early year decline in retail sales  hints of slower consumer spending growth in the first quarter   said Jennifer Lee  a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto 
The University of Michigan said on Friday its consumer sentiment index slipped to 93 6 in early February from a reading of 98 1 in January  The drop could reflect an uptick in gasoline prices early this month 
Still  the index was at the second highest level since January 2007  Economists had expected the sentiment index to hold steady 
U S  financial markets were little moved by the data 
Households were in early February less upbeat about current economic conditions as well as the outlook over the next six months 
The survey also showed a fairly big fall in household intentions to purchase long lasting manufactured goods  while plans to buy automobiles were little changed 
There was also some softening in income expectations  A special question in the survey showed a greater propensity to save  which could explain the recent weakness in retail sales 
 The decline in income expectations is an unfavorable sign for consumer spending   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan in New York 
 Increased savings is a possible explanation for why consumption has disappointed in recent months despite consumers receiving a windfall from the drop in gasoline prices  but it is hard to really know what to make of the responses to this question because it was last asked in 2010  
SPENDING LAG
Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  weakened in December and January  surprising economists who had hoped that lower gasoline prices and a relatively robust jobs market would unleash a wave of discretionary spending 
But cheaper gasoline can still boost consumer spending  a sentiment expressed this week by a top executive at PepsiCo Inc  N PEP  
 It takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so called benefit from lower gas prices   said Hugh Johnston  PepsiCo chief financial officer 
 You are going to see that over the course of six to eight months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior  it just sort of assimilates over time   Softer consumer spending has prompted economists to lower their estimates for first quarter growth  Still  they are optimistic about prospects for the rest of this year 
Growth this year is expected to be the strongest since 2005  driven in part by consumer spending  especially with the labor market gathering momentum  The economy added more than a million jobs in the last three months  a performance last seen in 1997 
 Consumer sentiment still remains at a relatively high level and paints a generally healthy picture of consumer perceptions of the economy   said Jim Baird  chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo  Michigan 
A separate report from the Labor Department showed import prices recorded their biggest drop in six years in January as the cost of petroleum and a range of other goods fell  pointing to muted inflation pressures in the near term 
Import prices tumbled 2 8 percent last month  the largest decline since December 2008  after sliding 1 9 percent in December  The seventh straight month of declines in import prices also reflected the dollar s significant strength against the currencies of the United States  main trading partners 
 This report sets the stage for declines in both the producer and consumer inflation in January   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York 
 However  we believe the U S  economy is experiencing an adjustment to much lower energy prices and that this does not signal the emergence of a sustained deflationary dynamic  In the 12 months through January prices declined 8 0 percent  the largest year on year drop since September 2009 ",2015-02-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-january-import-prices-post-largest-drop-since-2008-327993,327993

Solid Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Buying Now
 Investors often do not consider sales growth as a dependable metric when it comes to selecting stocks  This might be because of their preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum  However  betting on stocks based on such a perception may not prove worthwhile 
It s worth keeping in mind that when companies incur a loss  albeit temporarily  they are valued on their sales not and earnings  This is because top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance 
Also  in contrast with price to earnings and price to book value ratios  which can turn negative and cease to be relevant  the price to sales  P S  ratio is available even for firms that have hit choppy waters 
Further  a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  superior profits could be achieved through continued revenue growth  Also  management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales  which further underscores the importance of P S ratio 
A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits  Hence  considering a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be more prudent  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow lend a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments

176415,397931,PEP,Oil  U S  Markets Trade In Sideways Ranges  Major FX Continues Flat,opinion,"Healthcare stocks get burn ied
Wall Street shrugged off much improved U S  trade figures  and a slight China GDP beat  as Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders   Medicare for all  comments saw healthcare sector stocks take fright  This took the edge off generally upbeat earnings from heavyweights such as Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   ensuring the leading indices ended with a whimper rather than a shout  The S P 500 fell 0 25   the NASDAQ was down 0 05   and the Dow Jones finished flat 
With delegates scheduled to fly between Washington DC and Beijing twice in the next few weeks  further progress in the U S  China trade talks was largely ignored  Despite this  as well as upbeat earnings  robust data from China and dovish central banks with their hands ready at the monetary policy taps  the stock markets and oil continue to bumble along in sideways ranges  unable to push on to new highs  This combined could suggest that a lot of good news   both present and future   is already baked into prices at these levels  Ahead of the extended Easter holidays and into the end of the month  the markets may be much more vulnerable to negative headlines then they have been in recent times 
Australia will take the spotlight in Asia Pacific this morning with the release of their employment change data  With the Reserve Bank of Australia vexed at stubbornly low inflation even as jobs hold up  much like its Kiwi neighbor   a low print today could see the noise for a rate cut reach deafening levels  This could also have an out sized downward effect on the Australian dollar  AUD   which currently sits at 0 7160  The consensus is for a rise of 15 000 jobs  but frankly  the data set is notoriously volatile  Expect some fireworks at 0930 Singapore time 
The Easter egg hunt continues this evening in the States with the release of Retail Sales  The street is expecting a rebound higher from last month s  0 2  to 0 9   Again  with so much global recovery soft landing hope backed into equity and energy prices  a miss could have an out sized negative effect 
FX
Major currencies were becalmed overnight yet again as the volatility flatline continues  More action was seen in the emerging markets  EM  space with the U S  dollar weakening as traders repriced the better than expected China GDP print in EM currencies  That theme should continue in Asia today where we expect regional currencies to continue their gradual move higher 
Australian data at 0930 Singapore could have an out sized impact on the AUD today if the print is below expectations  The AUD is currently at 0 7160 against the greenback  with 0 7000 the crucial long term support level  Traders can look to the New Zealand dollar  NZD  for precedent  where a slight miss on yesterday s CPI data saw the NZD fall 1 50  at one stage 
The Indonesian rupiah has rallied from 14 150 against the dollar to 14 085 as exit polls suggest the incumbent  Jokowi  has won yesterday s presidential election  The official results aren t released until early May  but polls suggest a handsome margin of victory for the candidate  who is seen as much more markets and investment friendly 
Equities
With much of the region heading into the Easter break tomorrow  trading will likely be muted on the region s stock markets today  The rather sanguine response to the China GDP print by China s various stock markets suggests there is more than a little buyers fatigue for now  Jakarta should respond positively to the unofficial election results  with Australian stocks in line for a potential boost if the street decides the RBA rate cut is closer post the employment data 
Oil
Oil eased overnight ostensibly on lower official inventory drawdown data from the U S   with both Brent crudeand WTI struggling to make new topside in recent times  It s likely the real reasons behind this are buyer s fatigue  nervous longs and the still very overbought technical indicators 
Brent fell 0 15  to USD71 60 a barrel and WTI was down 0 50  to USD63 75 a barrel  Asia will likely be cautious about putting on new longs today ahead of the Easter break and the sideways price action of late 
Gold
With the U S  dollar stubbornly firm  improving economic data and the trade talks making tangible progress  the reasons for holding gold continue to diminish as investors rotate from defensive positioning  After gold s meltdown on Tuesday   it fell below the crucial USD1 280 00 an ounce support level   it dropped again overnight to close at USD1 273 50 an ounce  below secondary support at USD1 275 00 
Interest has clearly waned in the yellow metal for now  with the charts now wide open until USD1 245 00 an ounce  From a technical perspective  gold must recapture the USD1 275 00 1 280 00 region quickly  or the run for the exit door may become a stampede

176426,397942,PEP,Danone in talks to sell medical nutrition unit to Hospira  FT,news,"PARIS  Reuters    French dairy group Danone  PA DANO  is in talks to sell its medical nutrition business to U S  group Hospira  N HSP  in a deal valuing the unit at about  5 billion  the Financial Times reported on Sunday  citing people familiar with the situation 
The business paper said on its website that no deal was certain and that the talks were ongoing 
Contacted by Reuters  a spokesman for Danone in Paris declined to comment  No one at Hospira immediately returned a request for comment 
The deal would allow the U S  buyer to move its tax base to Europe  the FT said  a practice known as  inversion  criticized by President Barack Obama 
Reuters reported in February that Danone  the world s biggest yoghurt maker  was considering selling the business   which makes feeding tubes and foods and beverages for people with special nutritional needs   even though it has a profit margin above the group average 
The company is most likely to use the proceeds from a sale to fund an expansion of its faster growing baby food and dairy businesses  targeting acquisitions in Asia and Africa  analysts say 
Danone posted a worse than expected fall in first half operating profit last Friday after sluggish sales of baby food in Asia and dairy products in Europe took their toll 

Danone s challenges have refocused analysts  attention on its relatively small size compared to giants such as Swiss rival Nestle  Analysts have cited Nestle  VX NESN  and Pepsico  N PEP  as the most likely potential buyers

176427,397943,PEP,Russia may negotiate price limits with domestic food producers,news,"MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia may negotiate a price control agreement with domestic food producers to prevent speculative price hikes that would affect inflation after it banned half its agricultural imports from the West  the agriculture ministry said late on Friday 
Russia banned meat  fish  dairy  fruit and vegetables imports from the United States  the European Union s 28 member states  non EU member Norway  Canada  and Australia on Thursday in retaliation against sanctions over the Ukraine crisis 
Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov has acknowledged the ban would cause a short term spike in inflation  but said he saw no danger in the medium or long term as Russia started to look elsewhere for substitute imports 
The ministry  referring to a meeting with food sector unions  said   Participants at the meeting discussed the possibility of signing with producers and agricultural products processors an agreement on     price policy  to prevent any speculative rises in prices for agricultural products  
Russia has developed its own food industry over the past 20 years which consists of both home grown firms such as Cherkizovo and Ros Agro and local units of foreign companies  including Pepsico and Nestle 
According to the International Trade Centre  a joint venture between the United Nations and World Trade Organization  Russia imported  17 2 billion of food from the countries targeted by the ban  of which  9 2 billion was in the affected categories 
 While more imports from elsewhere may partly offset the supply shortage  Russian food prices will continue to creep higher   BNP Paribas said  noting that the ban would add 1 8 percentage points to Russia s consumer price index over 2014 15 
The prospect of higher inflation could weigh on retail sector shares   including Magnit  X5 Retail Group  Lenta  Dixy and O Key   analysts said 

 It will be difficult to pass cost inflation on to the consumer immediately  so we expect some pressure on margins over the short run   VTB Capital consumer analyst Maria Kolbina said

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 2  
Revenues are expected to be  12 65 billion  up 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo 
For PepsiCo  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of  1 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 49  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

During FY19  the business capability programme is due to be completed  bringing higher capacity and increased flexibility to the company  Trading at 10 1x consensus FY19e EV EBITDA  the shares offer interesting value 

Light on detail but performance in line
Following feedback from shareholders  Britvic s management has decided to scale back the level of detail disclosed with its trading statements  hence brand and regional performance are no longer supplied on a quarterly basis  with the intention of focusing more on the longer term 
We think the trends witnessed towards the end of FY18 are likely to have continued  geographically  we would expect France to have remained slightly weaker  while the businesses in Great Britain and Ireland would have continued to win market share 
In addition  the business capability programme implementation continues on schedule  with the commissioning of new lines  and a new warehouse in Rugby becoming operational later this year 
Strategy  Good shareholder returns
Britvic s strategy revolves around four key themes   1  generate profitable growth in core markets   2  realise global opportunities   3  step change its business capability  and  4  build trust and respect

 NEW YORK  July 27  Reuters    Wall Street stocks fell on
Wednesday as investors dumped technology shares after their
recent strong performance and as faltering debt talks kept the
market on edge 
 A profit warning from Juniper Networks   which sent
its shares down 21 1 percent to  24 61  dampened sentiment
about technology earnings  which have been among the strongest
this reporting period 
 The debt ceiling debate has grabbed much of the attention
this week as the deadline draws closer  Lawmakers have until
Aug  2 to agree a deal or face a potential default on U S 
government debt  For details  see  ID nN1E76P2HJ 
 The S P 500  has lost 2 6 percent so far this week as
acrimonious debate about raising the U S  debt ceiling has left
investors fretting over a U S  debt default or a possible
credit downgrade later in the year 
 For the day  the S P technology index  dropped 2 7
percent after the earnings disappointments 
  It s causing people to rethink their portfolios and move
some stuff around  especially on the technology side   With 
Juniper down 20 percent  I think a lot of that spilling over
into some of these telecom  and other companies  said Stifel

 NEW YORK  July 27  Reuters    Wall Street suffered its
worst day in eight weeks on Wednesday  hit by weak earnings 
lackluster economic data and no movement in Washington talks as
the deadline for a U S  default looms 
 The debt ceiling debate has grabbed much of investors 
attention this week as the Aug  2 deadline approaches  but it
took a back seat for much of the day as the market reacted to
earnings disappointments in industrial and technology sectors 
 A profit warning from Juniper Networks  sent its
shares down 20 9 percent to  24 66  damaging sentiment in the
technology sector  which has been among the strongest this
reporting period  The S P tech index  declined 3
percent 
 A late statement from White House that the government would
be  running on fumes  if the debt ceiling isn t increased by
the deadline added to selling  For details  see  ID nN1E76P2HJ 
 Besides a potential default on U S  debt  the government
could face a downgrade of its credit  The S P 500 index 
has lost nearly 3 percent so far this week amid acrimonious
debate about cutting spending and raising the debt limit 
 The market is beginning to show real concerns in terms of a
default  I don t think it s going to happen      but  are we
headed for a downgrade  That is becoming more of a possibility
as each day goes by   said Peter Cardillo  chief market
economist at Avalon Partners  in New York 
 Many investors are opting to wait for the outcome of the
talks before putting more money on the table

getting a little soft  
 Volume increased as the selling extended  a sign of weak
conviction among investors  Nearly 14 stocks fell for every one
that rose on the NYSE 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was down 198 75
points  or 1 59 percent  at 12 302 55  The Standard   Poor s

176514,398030,PEP,Pepsi Overview,opinion,"PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  is the 2nd largest soft drinks company in the world selling carbonated beverages or soda pop  Occasional consumption is brilliant but drinking them a lot isn t healthy if you re looking to prevent health problems  With this in mind  PepsiCo is trying to steer their portfolio in a more healthier direction  They are known for selling brands such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade  The company wants to ensure that the primary drive of Pepsi revenue is healthy drinks and snacks  and in fact  the company s organic revenues have grown  with PepsiCo working towards transforming itself to conform more to what their customers are wanting   a healthier lifestyle  To strive towards a more healthier image  PepsiCo have been investing in research to identify new ingredients so as to improve their products  They are also investing in advanced manufacturing technologies to come up with healthier products  Their proprietary frying innovation  for instance  promises to reduce the amount of fat in their potato chips by 20  
PepsiCo has also launched their Tropicana Essentials Probiotics  to cater for those moving away from carbonated drinks to juices  Reduced sugar sodas from brands such as 7Up are also encouraging consumers to take a new look as they look to drink their favorites with less sugar content  It s no wonder that with so much emphasis on healthier living  PepsiCo is set to generate millions from their water brand LIFEWTR The company has also adopted a motto of performance with Purpose  so as to meet the changing needs of their customers  They are shifting their portfolio to a wider range known as everyday Nutrition Products   These are products which contain nutrients such as fruits  vegetables and protein  When you consume them  you can be confident you won t be packing calories onto your waistline  and they are therefore referred to as guilt free products   In other words  when you drink some of these guilt free  beverages  you ll discover that they have less calories in them and are also lower in sodium  PepsiCo is busy deriving 45  of its revenue from these guilt free products  Demand for healthier food is on the rise  and PepsiCo has a clear strategy in place to transform its product portfolio toward these Guilt Free Products 
The company has beat consensus expectations on revenue and earnings  and in spite of higher transportation costs and increased marketing expenditure  solid performance and outlook have prompted PepsiCo to improve its organic revenue  and they are getting results  The Allied Market Research estimates that the Asian guilt free  snacks segment is likely to grow at a CAGR of 14 5  right up to 2022  With its focus on healthy products  PepsiCo s healthier snacks and beverages are looking to see a significant amount of the company s long term growth 
Going Healthier is Paying Off for PepsiCo  which has done a lot to shift its portfolio of carbonates to a healthier portfolio and has been launching new brands such as probiotics and sparkling waters  PepsiCo is a huge food manufacturer who continues to outperform rivals  and the drive to make PepsiCo s portfolio more healthy by adding new products to tackle new food and beverage trends is paying off ",2019-01-15,Narek Zakaryan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsi-overview-200375706,200375706
176515,398031,PEP,PepsiCo  PEP  Gains But Lags Market  What You Should Know,opinion,"PepsiCo  PEP  closed the most recent trading day at  109 89  moving  0 61  from the previous trading session  This move lagged the S P 500 s daily gain of 1 32   Meanwhile  the Dow gained 1 38   and the Nasdaq  a tech heavy index  added 1 74  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the food and beverage company had lost 0 9  over the past month  This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector s loss of 0 52  and the S P 500 s gain of 4 16  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PEP as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be February 15  2019  In that report  analysts expect PEP to post earnings of  1 49 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 13 74   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  19 51 billion  down 0 08  from the year ago period 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for PEP  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1 2  lower within the past month  PEP is holding a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now 
Valuation is also important  so investors should note that PEP has a Forward P E ratio of 18 65 right now  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 19 07  which means PEP is trading at a discount to the group 
Also  we should mention that PEP has a PEG ratio of 2 66  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  Beverages   Soft drinks stocks are  on average  holding a PEG ratio of 1 82 based on yesterday s closing prices 
The Beverages   Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector  This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 198  which puts it in the bottom 23  of all 250  industries

176516,398032,PEP,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For PepsiCo  PEP ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering PepsiCo  PEP   which belongs to the Zacks Beverages   Soft drinks industry 
This food and beverage company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4 27  
For the most recent quarter  PepsiCo was expected to post earnings of  1 56 per share  but it reported  1 59 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 92   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 51 per share  while it actually produced  1 61 per share  a surprise of 6 62  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for PepsiCo  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of  0 03  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 15  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-pepsico-pep-200378499,200378499
176522,398038,PEP,UPDATE 4 Japan s Suntory says considering merger with Kirin,news,"  Deal would create food drinks giant with  41 bln sales
   Merged entity would control half of Japan s beer market
   Merger could hit regulatory approval snags  analyst
   Could trigger consolidation in Japan  acquisitions abroad
   Kirin up 8 4 pct  other brewers also rise
  Adds more analyst comments 
 By Mayumi Negishi and Nathan Layne
 TOKYO  July 13  Reuters    Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings
Ltd said on Monday it was considering a merger with larger rival
Kirin Holdings Co  a deal that would create one of the world s
largest beverage and food firms 
 The news sent shares of Kirin soaring 8 4 percent to a
nine month high  and lifted shares of other brewers amid
speculation that a deal would trigger consolidation in the
sector 
 A merger would put Kirin and unlisted Suntory on par in
revenue terms with U S  based Kraft Foods and Pepsico Inc  and
help the two gain clout in Japan s mature market 
  If a merger is realised  that would give them the market
share to take leadership in pricing and help their soft drinks
businesses    a chronic weak spot in a ultra competitive market  
said JP Morgan analyst Naomi Takagi 
  It s a huge positive if they can do it  
 Suntory spokeswoman Naoko Tsuda said the company is
considering various options  and that nothing had been decided 
 When asked if a merger with Kirin was one of the options
under consideration  she said   Yes  
 Kirin spokesman Mitsutake Matano declined comment on the
possibility of a merger  repeating a statement that while Kirin
is working with Suntory on procurement  distribution and other
business activities  nothing had been decided 
 Kirin and Suntory are in talks to merge under a holding
company  and aim to agree on the deal this year  the Nikkei
business daily said  citing unidentified sources 
 The merged firm would be the largest player in the Japanese
beer and soft drink markets  and one of the biggest globally 
with combined annual sales of 3 8 trillion yen   41 billion  
giving them more resources to seek acquisitions abroad 
 Some analysts cautioned that a deal was by no means a sure
thing  citing potential regulatory resistance as the firms would
have command about half of Japan s beer market  and noting their
very different corporate cultures 
  It is not at all certain that a deal is really going to
happen  The hurdles ahead are by no means small   said Mizuho
Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji 
 Shares of Kirin were up 8 4 percent at 1 400 yen while the
Nikkei benchmark average was 1 percent lower  Sapporo surged 8 5
percent to 548 yen and Asahi climbed 4 2 percent to 1 418 yen 
  I don t think Asahi or Sapporo are going to stand idly by  
said Mizho s Saji 
 The Nikkei said Kirin Holdings President Kazuyasu Kato and
Suntory Holdings President Nobutada Saji met at the end of last
year to initiate talks and they had informed some of their
executives of the merger plan by early July 
 Japan s beer market has shrunk by 15 percent in terms of
shipment volumes over the past decade  forcing the industry to
slash costs and look overseas for growth 
 Earlier this year Kirin  which held 37 5 percent of Japan s
beer market in January June  agreed to a  2 5 billion buy out of
Australian brewer Lion Nathan  the latest in a series of deals by
the maker of Kirin Lager Beer 
 Last year Suntory outmanoeuvred both Kirin and Asahi
Breweries Ltd with a more than 600 million euro   836 million 
deal for Danone s Frucor juice unit and said it was ready spend
another  2 billion or so on acquisitions 
 Suntory  almost wholly owned by its founding family  and
Kirin hold a combined market share for beer products in Japan of
roughly 50 percent  putting them well ahead of Asahi Breweries at
about 37 percent  industry data show 
    1 92 48 Yen

  Adds background 
 By Mayumi Negishi and Nathan Layne
 TOKYO  July 13  Reuters    Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings
Ltd said on Monday it was considering a merger with larger rival
Kirin Holdings Co in a deal that would create one of the world s
largest beverage and food firms 
 The news sent shares of Kirin soaring 7 8 percent to a
nine month high and lifted shares of other brewers amid
speculation that a deal would trigger consolidation in the
sector 
 A merger would put Kirin and unlisted Suntory on par in
revenue terms with U S  based Kraft Foods and Pepsico Inc  and
give the two more pricing power in Japan s mature market 
  If a merger is realised  that would give them the market
share to take leadership in pricing and help their soft drinks
businesses    a chronic weak spot in an ultra competitive market 
in Japan  said JP Morgan analyst Naomi Takagi 
  It s a huge positive if they can do it  
 Suntory spokeswoman Naoko Tsuda said that the company was
considering various options including a merger with Kirin but
that nothing had been decided 
 Kirin spokesman Mitsutake Matano declined comment on the
possibility of a merger  repeating a statement that Kirin is
working with Suntory on procurement  distribution and other
business activities 
 Kirin and Suntory are in talks to merge under a holding
company  and aim to agree on the deal this year  the Nikkei
business daily said  citing unidentified sources 
 The merged firm would be the largest player in the Japanese
beer and soft drink markets and one of the largest worldwide 
with combined annual sales of 3 8 trillion yen   41 billion  
giving it more resources to seek acquisitions abroad 
 Some analysts cautioned that a deal was by no means a sure
thing  citing potential regulatory resistance to a merged entity
that would command about half of Japan s beer market 
  It is not at all certain that a deal is really going to
happen  The hurdles ahead are by no means small   said Mizuho
Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji 
 Shares of Kirin rose 7 8 percent to 1 392 yen while the
Nikkei benchmark average fell 2 6 percent  Sapporo Holdings
surged 6 1 percent to 536 yen and Asahi Breweries climbed 2 5
percent to 1 395 yen 
 If the deal does get regulatory approval  Kirin would
comfortably nudge out Asahi Breweries s 37 percent market share 
It would also capture Suntory s health and soft drink businesses
in southeast Asia and in China  Mizuho s Saji said 
  I don t think Asahi or Sapporo are going to stand idly by  
he said 
 The Nikkei said Kirin Holdings President Kazuyasu Kato and
Suntory Holdings President Nobutada Saji met at the end of last
year to initiate talks and they had informed some of their
executives of the merger plan by early July 
 The two sides will ask for feedback from Japan s anti trust
regulator as early as this week  it said 
 Japan s beer market has shrunk by 15 percent in terms of
shipment volumes over the past decade  forcing the industry to
slash costs and look overseas for growth 
 Earlier this year Kirin  which held 37 5 percent of Japan s
beer market in January June  agreed to a  2 5 billion buy out of
Australian brewer Lion Nathan  bringing the total that the maker
of Kirin Lager Beer has spent on acquisitions to 968 5 billion
yen over the past three years 
 Last year Suntory  which is almost wholly owned by its
founding family  outmanoeuvred both Kirin and Asahi with a more
than 600 million euro   836 million  deal for Danone s Frucor
juice unit and said it was ready to spend another  2 billion or
so on acquisitions 
 Suntory  which vies with Sapporo for a distant third place in
Japan s beer market behind Kirin and Asahi  has a product lineup
that includes Malt s beer  Dakara sports drinks  vitamins and a
whiskey that actor Bill Murray endorses in his role in the 2003
film  Lost in Translation

PEP s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  5 65 per share and revenue of  64 74 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  8 03  and  1 92   respectively

 NEW YORK  Aug 4  Reuters    U S  stocks edged higher on
Tuesday as better than expected data on home sales underpinned
signs of an economic recovery  but the gains were capped as

176549,398065,PEP,UPDATE 2 France s Sarkozy vows to protect key industries,news,"  Launches 20 bln euro support fund
   Available to viable firms hit by bank lending drought
   Seen protecting strategic industries
 
  Adds details  quotes 
 By Yann Leguernigou
 SAINT JULIEN LE CHEDON  France  Nov 20  Reuters    President
Nicolas Sarkozy vowed on Thursday to protect key companies from
being swallowed up by the financial crisis as he launched a 20
billion euro   25 05 billion  fund to help French industry 
 In his latest step to give life support to the euro zone s
second biggest economy  Sarkozy said the fund would invest in
viable firms in need of cash  and shore up the balance sheets of
companies deemed vulnerable in the face of falling stock prices 
 France s aim was to make sure the financial crisis did not
trigger the disappearance of strategic French industries at a
time when banks were still proving reluctant to lend and
investors could make easy investments in major companies 
  The day we don t build trains  aeroplanes  automobiles and
ships  what is left of the French economy  Memories  I will not
make France a tourist reserve   Sarkozy said in a speech at an
aerospace supply manufacturing company near Paris 
  I want France to keep its factories  I want this process of
factory relocation and outsourcing to stop and I want firms with
the potential to develop to be able to do so  even if financial
institutions at the moment are a little timid   he said 
 The new fund would be managed by state bank Caisse des
Depots  a state bank that traditionally has been used by the
government to shield companies from hostile overseas predators 
 It would consist of 20 billion euros to begin with  and
could grow in value  Sarkozy said  noting foreign investors  and
particularly sovereign wealth funds  would be welcome to join 
 France and the CDC planned to raise a total of six billion
euros in debt for the fund  with the rest coming from assets
previously held by the CDC and the state 
 
 PROTECTIONIST 
 Investments would be made in viable companies  notably
small  and medium sized enterprises unable to obtain capital
from blocked financial markets  he said 
 Money would also be poured into medium  and large sized
companies including those that were deemed as strategic for the
economy but which would be vulnerable to takeovers 
 References made to the creation of such a fund have raised
fears of protectionism in a country that many say treated
yoghurt as strategic when U S  soft drinks giant PepsiCo was
rumoured to be eyeing Groupe Danone in 2005 
 For Jean Claude Gruffat  who heads the American Chamber of
Commerce in France  the fund needs to be watched with attention 
  It is perfectly legitimate for states to protect their
strategic interest  they are all doing it  The question is what
is included in your definition of strategic sectors of
interest   said Gruffat 
  Every country has its own policy but my view is that as the
American Chamber of Commerce  we will pay a lot of attention to
what s done in different countries and make sure we have a level
playing field for our companies   he said by telephone 
 Highlighting that investments would not mean state control 
Sarkozy said that the fund would only take minority interests 
 Sarkozy said the fund would be headed by Patricia Barbizet 
an executive of Artemis  the holding company of billionaire
investor Francois Henri Pinault 
 Bankers have noted the French investment fund is not the
same as the sovereign wealth funds of oil producing or emerging
market states that typically use reserves to invest in markets
abroad  sometimes to secure natural resources

176550,398066,PEP,Food safety drive tough on smaller companies study,news,"  New food safety rules could encourage mergers  report says
  Added standards benefit big producers  hurt small players
   Smaller processors  exporters  handlers under pressure
 
 By Laura MacInnis
 GENEVA  June 24  Reuters    Food safety checks designed to
prevent dangerous contamination are making it difficult for
smaller businesses to compete against larger rivals  two U N 
agencies said in a report obtained by Reuters on Wednesday 
 The Food and Agriculture Organisation  FAO  and World Health
Organisation  WHO  study said producers  processors and
exporters in developing states were struggling to cope with new
and overlapping requirements 
 High profile recalls in response to salmonella in peanuts 
pistachios  mayonnaise  alfalfa sprouts and canola meal in the
United States and Canada have raised consumer awareness about
food borne diseases and led to new government and industry
standards 
 China has also tightened its oversight following major
scandals including the use of melamine    a chemical used in
fertiliser and plastics    in milk powder and infant formula 
Six toddlers died and 300 000 were made sick 
 The report for next week s meeting in Rome of the Codex
Alimentarius Commission  a joint WHO and FAO body on food
safety  said industry moves to introduce voluntary rules on top
of government oversight had produced mixed results 
  To the extent that there are economies of scale in
compliance and or larger firms are better able to access finance
and other resources  compliance processes are likely to induce
processes of consolidation and concentration   said the study 
 The document was also discussed on Wednesday at the World
Trade Organisation 
 Contamination problems have affected many food majors 
including Nestle  whose U S  baking division last week recalled
its Toll House refrigerated cookie dough products after a food
safety warning about E  coli bacteria 
 PepsiCo s North American snack unit Frito Lay this year
recalled its pistachios in the United States and Canada as a
precaution during a broader recall that caused grocery chain
Kroger to pull products from its shelves 
 Commodities firms have also been affected  Processing plants
and shipments at Cargill and Bunge have faced more stringent
standards  including third party laboratory tests to prove
products are problem free 
 The biggest constraints were being felt in poorer nations 
The WHO FAO study said small players may need assistance to
avoid being squeezed out of the market by the drive to sanitise
the food chain 
  Exporters of fresh fruit and vegetables  meat  dairy and
seafood must comply with multi tiered requirements including
quality grades and standards  traceability requirements  labels
of origin  phytosanitary controls and food safety standards  of
both a regulatory and private nature   it said 
  It is evident that a number of developing countries  and
exporters and producers therein  face challenges in complying

176565,398081,PEP,How To Earn A 10  Yield On Cost From PepsiCo Dividends ,opinion,"Dividend yield is one of the most commonly utilized financial ratios for income investors  It is also one of the easiest to calculate  The current dividend yield is simply the annual dividend payment of a stock divided by the share price  It tells an investor the amount of dividend income they will receive from buying a stock  expressed as a percentage 
For example  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  has a current dividend yield of 3 4   But income investors should also familiarize themselves with yield on cost  which is different than the current dividend yield  While the current dividend yield is simply the company s dividend per share divided by the current share price  yield on cost is the current dividend per share divided by the investor s cost basis 
Yield on cost basically shows the yield of the stock from a historical basis  considering the original price paid and not the current price  It also proves the benefits of investing in high quality dividend growth stocks like PepsiCo 
Why Yield On Cost Is Important
The current yield is a very simple equation  In PepsiCo s case  the company currently pays an annualized dividend of  3 71 per share  With a recent share price of  108  investors buying the stock today will earn a dividend yield of 3 4   The current dividend yield could change going forward  if the share price fluctuates  or if the company adjusts its dividend payment higher or lower  Dividend stocks are attractive for income investors  as they provide dividend income  which is especially valuable in a low interest rate environment 
Put simply  dividend stocks are good but dividend growth stocks are even better  Companies that reward shareholders with a dividend demonstrate that they prioritize the interests of their investors  At the same time  companies that can raise their dividends on a regular basis prove that they have strong business models with durable competitive advantages  There is perhaps no stronger sign of a high quality business than consistent dividend increases each year 
PepsiCo is a Dividend Aristocrat  an exclusive group of 53 stocks in the S P 500 Index that have raised their dividends for 25  consecutive years  PepsiCo has actually raised its dividend for over 40 years in a row  including a solid 15  increase in 2018  Continued dividend growth over many years leads to a high yield on cost  To calculate yield on cost  divide the current dividend per share by the cost basis per share  Then  multiply by 100 to derive a percentage 
Yield on cost can be influenced by many factors  The yield on cost could be higher than the current yield if an investor purchased shares at a lower price  Or  yield on cost could be higher if an investor reinvested the dividends over the holding period  Reinvesting dividends allows investors to use their dividend payments to buy additional shares of stock  This results in more dividends  which in turn allows for more shares to be purchased  and so on  Another way yield on cost can rise over time is by selecting stocks that raise their dividends over time  Dividend growth stocks reward their shareholders who buy and hold for the long term with higher dividend income each year  PepsiCo is a great example of a dividend growth stock 
How To Earn 10  A Year From PepsiCo
For example  assume that PepsiCo raises its dividend by 8  per year over the next 10 years  This is a reasonable dividend growth estimate for PepsiCo  as the company has averaged 8 1  annual dividend growth in the past 10 years  If the company maintains an 8  annual dividend growth rate  in 10 years the annualized dividend payment will rise to approximately  8 01 per share  The investors who purchased shares today at the same price of  108  will therefore have a yield on cost of 7 4  
Now assume that same investor reinvested their dividends along the way  This would have the effect of raising the dividend growth rate by the amount of the current dividend yield  which in this case is the reinvestment rate  In other words  an investor who buys PepsiCo shares at a current yield of 3 4  and reinvests dividends  will have total dividend growth of 11 4  per year  assuming the company raises its dividend by 8  each year and the current yield stays at 3 4   With an 11 4  total dividend growth rate  the investor buying today at  108 per share will generate a yield on cost of 10 0  in 10 years 
When forecasting future dividend growth rate  it is important to use reasonable estimates  Not all companies can maintain a high dividend growth rate over time  It takes a profitable business with strong brands  competitive advantages  and growth opportunities  PepsiCo has all of these qualities  It is a diversified food and beverage giant  with annual revenue of  63 billion and a market capitalization of  153 billion 
PepsiCo has a large portfolio of food and beverage brands  Food accounted for approximately 53  of sales in 2017  with beverages the remaining 47   It has a diversified portfolio  with 22 individual brands that each bring in at least  1 billion in sales each year  In addition to its core beverage brands like Pepsi  it has a huge snacks portfolio under the Frito Lay brand  which is a major driver of PepsiCo s growth 

Source  2018 CAGNY Conference Presentation  page 4
These brands provide PepsiCo the growth necessary to raise its dividend each year  For example  the company grew organic revenue by 4 9  in the most recent quarter  and by 3 4  over the first three quarters of 2018  Adjusted earnings per share increased 6  over the first three quarters 
In recent years  PepsiCo has built a large portfolio of healthier food brands like Quaker  Naked  and Sabra  It is investing in healthier products to adapt to changing consumer preferences  in particular the decline in soda consumption  In late August  PepsiCo announced it will acquire at home carbonated beverage maker Sodastream International Ltd  NASDAQ SODA  for  3 2 billion  This acquisition will help PepsiCo move further into the at home sparkling beverage market 
PepsiCo expects to generate adjusted earnings per share of  5 65 in 2018  an 8  increase from the previous year  With a current annual dividend of  3 71 per share  PepsiCo is likely to have a dividend payout ratio of 66  for 2018  This means the current dividend payment is sufficiently covered  with room for continued increases each year 
Final Thoughts
With so many various financial ratios and statistics out there  investing in stocks can seem overwhelming  But when it comes to dividend stocks  yield on cost is one of the most important concepts an investor should understand  as it reveals the true power of compounding dividends over time  Investing in a stock for a 3 4  dividend yield today might not seem overly impressive  but put differently  a high quality dividend growth stock like PepsiCo could provide a 10  yield on cost in 10 years through reinvested dividends and dividend growth

176582,398098,PEP,Reports Or War ,opinion,"The focus is on two key events 

Will Finland cool down heated relations  Russia US summit in Helsinki 

Tensions between the US and Russia are not limited to the political arena  Russia continues to increase the speed of its aggressive campaign against Ukraine and provide strong support to Syrian President Bashar al Assad in the Syrian civil war 
The issue in which there might be the most mutual understanding is Syria  Trump wants to withdraw American troops from there as quickly as possible  but without giving the territory to the Iranians  Putin also wants the Americans to leave so that Syrian President Bashar al Assad can control more territories  including oil rich areas  where he will be able to earn money to rebuild his country 
Another area of common interest is the undermining of the European Union  especially the positions of German Chancellor Angela Merkel  For Trump  this is a matter of winning a trade war and pacifying those whom he considers people who love to live at someone else s expense  For Putin  this is a way to get rid of sanctions  Merkel remains one of the few strong supporters of anti Russian sanctions  while more conservative governments in Italy  Austria  and Hungary would prefer to lift sanctions and resume business with Russia as usual 
Putin is likely to gain more than Trump from the US Russia summit  which could take place in the near future  And the head of the US needs this meeting mostly in order to amuse his own ego 
Basically  it should be interesting  Especially considering that  unlike soccer  there is something to  root  for here

176584,398100,PEP,U S  China Trade War Or European Drought  Oats Futures Rally Anyhow,opinion,"Oat lovers may have nervously downed their favorite breakfast the past week after seeing US futures of the grain rocket without much explanation  The good news for them is that the market action in Chicago is unlikely to change the boxed price of the cereal anytime soon   or might not all  if history is a guide 
A week into August  oats futures on the Chicago Board of Trade are up 12 percent on the month  with more than half of those gains   6 7 percent precisely   coming from Monday s trade alone  The market has risen in eight of the past nine sessions  topping the daily performance chart of 60 commodity and global macro futures tracked by Barchart since Friday 
Reasons cited by analysts range from worries about the drought affecting both the quality and volume of European grown oat to speculation that the US China trade war could prompt Beijing to begin buying oat from top producer Canada to avoid paying tariffs on American feed grains 

Monday s peak of  2 6690 per bushel on the CBOT placed oat near 5 month highs and on track to a 11 percent gain for 2018 after a rally that has persisted since April  with the exception of last month  While nowhere near the 34 percent gain posted by CBOT wheat on the year  oat has outperformed the two other major US grains markets   corn and soy  which are up 6 percent and down 8 percent  respectively 
And the upward trajectory may not be over yet  with Investing com s daily technicals still calling for a  Strong Buy  and citing stiff Fibonacci based resistance only from  2 75 per bushel onward   about 8 cents above Monday s settlement  Some analysts have a higher target of  3 per bushel 
Current Rally Purely Driven By Speculation 
 Other than being a nice  round number  there s nothing really fundamental or technical to support that  3 forecast   said Shawn Hackett at Hackett Financial Advisors  a grains analysis service in Boca Raton  Florida   It tells you of the sheer speculation that s driving this market  and I think it s all to do with China possibly looking at Canadian oats to circumvent their US feed imports  
But Hackett also thinks Beijing s stringent  Photosanitary Protocol  for grain imports will end up hampering the entry of Canadian oats  resulting in the CBOT rally eventually running out of steam  With rice  for example  China opened for imports in 2001 but only started taking US product last year after the two agreed on the protocol 
Impressive as oat s milestones and prices are now  the market remains one of the smallest components of the US agricultural complex  with just about 25 million bushels trading on the CBOT compared with the more than 9 billion bushels of open interest in corn 
The less liquid conditions for trading oat versus major grains means that it takes just a handful of speculators sometimes to create a big move up or down in the cereal s futures 
Futures Moves Have Little Impact On Real Prices
Spikes and tumbles in CBOT oat seldom  if ever  filter through to the physical market  which determines what leading oats brands such as PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  s Quaker  B G Foods  NYSE BGS   McCann s and Trader Joe s pay for the raw material  With the US oat production barely covering domestic demand and the country not shipping any for exports  international physical prices vary by origin of the grain   whether they are Canadian  Australian  German  Finnish or Swedish   and by grading that separates oats for human consumption from that for animal feed 
 A number of the people who deal in the physical product don t even use the futures because of its exaggerated volatility   said Chuck Penner  an analyst who specializes in Canadian crops for Winnipeg based Leftfield Commodity Research 
 The physical average price for oat is around  2 per bushel now  and that s a 70 cent discount from the futures   Penner said   Even if you move the futures up to  3  it wouldn t make a material impact on a bag of oatmeal  
While he agrees with Hackett that the current futures rally is almost entirely speculative  he thinks the buying is being driven by worries about how crops were wilting to extreme heat in Europe  rather than Canada s potential to export oat to China 
 The only thing that s really changed in the last few weeks is the recognition that the European crop is in trouble   Penner added   Otherwise  both demand and supply are pretty stable  ",2018-08-07,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-war-or-european-drought-oat-rallies-anyhow-200336845,200336845

176605,398121,PEP,Bearish Sentiment Ramps Up On PepsiCo Before Earnings,opinion,"Long Puts Have Been Popular And Short Interest Has Surged
PepsiCo Inc   NASDAQ PEP  will be in focus before the open tomorrow  when the company will release its second quarter earnings results  PEP stock actually posted its best post earnings performance in at least two years back in April when it popped 2 1   which also marked a third straight positive earnings reaction  In the past two years overall  the beverage giant has averaged a slim 0 7  swing the day after earnings  but this time around the options market is pricing in a much bigger move of 3 5  for tomorrow s session 
Taking a broader view of recent options data on PepsiCo  sentiment seems to be leaning bearish  For example  the equity s 10 day put call volume ratio across the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  is an even 1 00  which ranks in the 88th annual percentile  In other words  put buying has been unusually popular in recent weeks  relative to call buying 
Plus  the largest increase in open interest during that two week time frame occurred at the July 115 call    but activity was almost exclusively sell to open  This suggests traders are expecting PEP shares to hold below  115 through the close on Friday  July 20  when front month options expire  or they re betting on a post earnings volatility crush  Taking a quick peak at today s trading  the most popular contract is the weekly 7 13 110 strike call  where new positions are being opened 
Bears have certainly been taking action outside the options pits  with short interest exploding on PepsiCo this year  In just the last two reporting periods the number of shares held by short sellers increased by 83  to 12 5 million    the most since late 2015 
Analysts  though  have mostly remain bullish  The majority of those in coverage still have  buy  or  strong buy  ratings on the stock  and the average 12 month price target stands up at  114 74  In fact  Jefferies just this morning upped its price target to  103  At last check  the security was trading down 1 1  at  108 35  consolidating just below potential resistance from the 160 day moving average and a 50  Fibonacci retracement of its year to date high to low ",2018-07-09,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bearish-sentiment-ramps-up-on-pepsico-before-earnings-200329947,200329947

PepsiCo Inc   NASDAQ PEP  is set to release their FQ2 18 earnings July 10th before the market opens  Estimize consensus predicts an EPS of  1 54  three cents higher than Wall Street s prediction  Estimize has beaten Wall Street in Pepsi EPS projections 92  of the time  Estimize anticipates a revenue of  16 201B while Wall Street expects  16 125B 

Pepsi has tried to adapt to a decreasing demand for sugary drinks  Now almost half of Pepsi s products are zero or low calorie beverages  The company has also expanded to the snack market  They have acquired many smaller health focused snack and drink brands whose successes have been able to offset some of the losses caused by the decline of Pepsi s main products  Additionally  the  Uncle Drew  movie funded by Pepsi and starring a character from one of its commercials has done surprisingly well in the box office and they are hoping that translates to an increase in soda sales

176607,398123,PEP,Sterling Dives Amid UK Political Turmoil  UK Manufacturing Output Due,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index is a little more than 0 1  higher on Tuesday  trying to build on the modest gains it posted in the previous session  The British pound nosedived yesterday  following news that UK Foreign secretary Boris Johnson had resigned  with sterling dollar also being 0 2  lower today 
STOCKS  US markets closed higher on Monday  in the absence of any concerning trade related headlines to dent risk appetite  The Dow Jones outperformed  gaining 1 31   while the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both advanced by 0 88   The risk on environment seems to have lingered  as futures suggest that the Dow  S P  and Nasdaq 100  are all set to open higher today as well  Asian equities took their cue from their US counterparts  with almost all major indices being in the green on Tuesday  In Japan  the Nikkei 225 and the Topix climbed by 0 66  and 0 25  respectively  while in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng rose 0 51   The same holds true in Europe  where futures suggest most major benchmarks are due to open a little higher today 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices are higher on Tuesday  with WTI and Brent crude advancing by 0 57  and 0 73  respectively  amid news that a workers  strike in Norway could impact the nation s oil production  While the loss of supply is not expected to be massive  it comes on top of supply disruptions in Canada  Libya  Venezuela  as well as sanctions on Iran  and hence may have attracted more attention than otherwise  In precious metals  gold is down by 0 1  today  trading close to the  1 256 ounce level  It managed to touch a two week high of  1 265 yesterday  but gave back most of those gains before the session ended  pressured by a strengthening US dollar 

Major movers  Pound dives after UK Foreign secretary resigns  risk appetite stays firmThe UK political climate is changing rapidly  Whereas the pound took the resignation of Brexit secretary Davis as a positive sign  reinforcing the notion that the tide was shifting in favor of a  smoother  Brexit  that narrative got turned on its head after Foreign secretary Boris Johnson resigned yesterday  He quit in protest at PM May s new Brexit plan  arguing it maintains too close ties with the EU  His departure   at least from the market s perspective   was perceived as raising the likelihood for a rebellion within the Conservative Party that challenges Theresa May s position as PM 
Such a revolt  by extent  could also keep the Brexit negotiations in a deadlock  as any Tory Brexiteer that potentially replaces PM May is unlikely to adopt her new  smooth  Brexit plan  Sterling plunged on the news  with euro sterling briefly touching a four month high as the probability of a no deal Brexit was probably seen as rising  The currency rebounded somewhat after the Conservative Party Chairman said he doesn t expect a leadership change  with heightened expectations that the BoE will raise rates in August likely playing a large role in limiting any greater losses in the pound as well 
The broader market showed little response to the UK political turmoil  with risk appetite remaining firm in the absence of any worrisome trade related news  Major US stock markets closed higher  while the safe haven Japanese yen lost ground against the euro as well as the dollar  posting a new six week low against both 
The dollar index  meanwhile  managed to snap a four day losing streak and close in positive territory on Monday  possibly drawing some strength from an uptick in longer term Treasury yields  In US political news  President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court  with a potential confirmation seen as putting the court on a more conservative path on social issues  such as abortion rights 
Elsewhere  the euro advanced against most of its major peers on Monday  amid a flurry of remarks from ECB officials   most notably Mario Draghi   reiterating their confidence in the eurozone s economy and reaffirming a gradual path towards normalization Day ahead  UK industrial and manufacturing production  German ZEW survey and US JOLTS job openings on the agendaUK industrial and manufacturing output data  the ZEW surveys gauging business morale in Germany and JOLTS jobs openings out of the US are on Tuesday s agenda 
May s industrial and manufacturing production data   the latter being a subset of the former   will be made public out of the UK at 0830 GMT  A rebound in activity is projected by analysts after factory output recorded its worst month since late 2012 during April  Specifically  industrial and manufacturing production are anticipated to expand by 0 5  and 0 9  m m  after contracting by 0 8  and 1 4  m m respectively in April  An improvement is also forecast in the annual growth figures  Stronger readings are likely to stoke rate hike expectations by the Bank of England during its upcoming August meeting  consequently supporting the pound  The probabilities for a rate increase during the aforementioned meeting  which are also expected to be sensitive to political Brexit developments  currently run close to 60  according to UK overnight index swaps 
The numbers on the UK s May goods trade balance are also due at 0830 GMT  a narrowing of the relevant deficit is being forecast by analysts 
The ZEW institute s surveys on business sentiment in Germany  the eurozone s largest economy  are slated for release at 0900 GMT  Both the economic sentiment and current conditions indices are expected to deteriorate in July  In particular  the economic sentiment index is projected to stand at  18 0  its lowest since 2012  The threat of tariffs by the Trump administration is one of the factors that has weighed on morale in the past and may continue doing so 
Out of Canada  data on June s housing starts and May s building permits are due at 1215 GMT and 1230 GMT correspondingly 
The US will be on the receiving end of the JOLTS job openings report at 1400 GMT  The number of openings is expected at around 6 6 million  down from April s record high of around 6 7m  but still at robust levels

In equities  PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  is among companies releasing quarterly results  the firm s report will be made public before the US market open 
In energy markets  API data on weekly crude stocks are due at 2030 GMT Technical Analysis  GBP USD looking neutral in the near termGBP USD has recovered somewhat after hitting a near one week low of 1 3188 on Monday  The RSI is moving sideways after yesterday s sharp fall  projecting a mostly neutral picture in the short term at the moment 
Better than anticipated readings out of the UK later in the day are likely to boost the pair  with resistance potentially coming around the 1 33 round figure  In case of stronger bullish movement  the attention could next turn to yesterday s four week high of 1 3362 
On the downside and in the event of weak UK prints  support may come around the current level of the 100 period moving average line at 1 3209  Notice that the 50 period MA at 1 3196  and consequently the 1 32 handle  are also part of the area around this level  Further below  the 1 31 mark would increasingly come into scope

Gold settled lower at a one month low as the Dollar continued to strengthen  The quick resolution of the US government shutdown might have further pressured gold as insecurity about government funding was resolved in these volatile times  As the 10 Year US Treasury Note remained close to its 3  year high gold traders could have felt a continued uncertainty  According to one theory  higher high grade bond yields weigh on the price of gold as both are considered safe havens but only bonds generate accruing income via interest 
As central banks consider inflation one of the key aspect for deciding how to manage their monetary policy  gold traders could be interested in the release of CPI numbers this Wednesday in the US and Germany

176791,398307,PEP,S P 500 Futures  The Higher It Goes The Less Trade There ,opinion,"Yesterday s rally started with Hong Kong stocks posting their best day in more than a year  Better than expected earnings from the airlines and automakers helped push the Dow Jones to its 44th new high of the year  as treasury yields and the dollar traded to their highest since July  There is no doubt about it  the higher the markets go  the less volume there is 
Whats up with the S P 500 futures  It keeps keeps going higher  and the ranges are getting smaller  No one wants to buy it though  everyone I talk to keeps trying to sell it  At 12 00 CT the total range in the S P 500 futures  ESZ17 CME  was only 3 5 handles  Yesterday may have possibly been one of the tightest non holiday ranges ever  I have seen price action in the past like this  but in the last few months there has been some extreme examples 
Going forward a little  at 1 15 there were only 520 000 ES traded  of which 110 000 came from the Monday nights Globex session  That means only 410 000 ES futures had traded  and if algorithmic and high frequency trading  lets be nice  make up 50  of that  it means only 205 000 futures had traded by humans in the day session  I know they say that the bots make up 70  to 80  of the volume  but it s hard to believe even they can operate in such a low volume  narrow trading range environment 
Around 1 40 CT the ES took out its 2529 50 Globex and high for the day and traded up to 2530 75  while the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQZ17 CME  were down ticking  and the early MiM came out showing  450 mil to buy 
When I spoke to the PitBull  he said he was amazed how the markets act  that they never pull back  He went on to say that Europe has done exactly what the U S  did with all the quantitative easing  that they have been  printing money like mad   For the last few years  I have been saying the reason the markets keep going up is because of negative  or historically low rates  and i still think that is the driving force  Even if the fed hikes rates in December  and does three or four hikes in 2018  I do not think things will change that much 
At 2 30 the MiM was showing buy  288 million  and the ES shot up to 2532 50  but didn t pull back at all when the MiM   MOC flipped to  100 million to sell  It s been an amazing run  and you know what  It s not over  In the end the S P 500 futures  ESZ17 CME  settled at 2532 75  up  6 50 handles  or  0 25   the Dow Jones futures  YMZ17 CBT  settled at 22608  up  101 points  or  0 45   the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQZ17 CME  settled at 5998 00  up  17 50 points  or  0 29  and the Russell 2000  RTYZ17 CME  settled at 1516 60  up  3 10 points or  0 20  on the day 
The mistakes people make when it comes to trading is that they end up selling because they are not long  and that has been a major problem for most futures traders  and as much as I hate to say it  that includes me  It s the old  up too high to buy  theory  or  I didn t buy the dip so I ll sell into it   Very stupid way to go

Our View
Most can t believe it  but like the old saying goes  seeing is believing  The S P 500 futures traded up to 2533 25 yesterday  While the markets continue higher  there is a huge lack of volume  It really is hard to believe  That said  I do think the S P is nearing a short term top  I do not think it can keep going up without some type of pull back  The ES is up 5 days in a row  Can it go 7 or 8  I guess it can  but something tells me you have to be careful  a shakeout is coming but it s not going to crash or anything like that

176887,398403,PEP,Earnings Call Digest Yellen Speaks  But Companies Remain Quiet,opinion,"Earnings season started last week  but only with a few reports  Many more companies will report this week  A couple of industrial distributors  MSC  NYSE MSM  and Fastenal  NASDAQ FAST   confirmed that the industrial economy is holding strong  Prices haven t moved yet  but probably will if the economy continues to improve 
While there weren t a lot of companies speaking  a lot of central bankers were  Yellen spoke about balance sheet normalization with Congress  and other central banks around the world are likely to begin normalizing soon too 
Bank of the Ozarks made a comment about commercial construction markets that bears watching though  The regional bank said it expects markets to slow because of high costs of labor  increasing interest rates and satisfaction of pent up demand  If this is true  it s an interest rate sensitive market that is showing signs of sluggishness  This is a classic late cycle event  We will watch what other bank CEOs say next week for confirmation 
The Macro Outlook 
The industrial economy is showing continued and steady improvement
 Feedback from customers is consistent with the theme of continued and steady improvement From an end market perspective  aerospace  fabricated metals and machine jobs continued to improve as did oil and gas related business end markets like heavy truck and agriculture have appeared to bottom and showed some improvement     CEO Erik Gershwind  Industrial Distributor 
Pretty much all markets are performing well
 In fact  it s difficult to identify a major market that is acting particularly poorly at this point  And the feedback that we re getting from our RVPs remains overall very favorable     CFO Holden Lewis  Industrial Distributor 
Prices still haven t moved  but that could change
  even if the commodities have moved and to be honest that s something that surprised a bit over the last call it 6 months to 12 months these commodities certainly for a while have firmed up and there wasn t as much manufacturer movement  Now  that could change  We are hearing bits and pieces that that could change as capacity starts to get fueled out by the manufacturers  But really for us the trigger is seeing a manufacturer move their list prices     CEO Erik Gershwind  Industrial Distributor 
A better economy will eventually allow companies to take price
 if we continue to see demand get better and the environment remains somewhat inflationary  then a window would probably open for us to take advantage of a little bit of pricing if the market affords     CEO Daniel Florness  Industrial Distributor 
But the Fed continues to expect that interest rates will remain low for the longer run
 the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer run neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades     Chair Janet Yellen  Central Bank

The global economy is strong and central banks are noticing
 for the first time in many years  the global economy is experiencing synchronous growth  and authorities in the euro area and the United Kingdom are beginning to discuss the time when the need for monetary accommodation will diminish     Governor Lael Brainard  Central Bank 
If the Fed keeps hiking  the ECB will have to follow
 If the U S  hikes more than once or two times it is going to be very difficult for the ECB to stay on hold for too long  I think that you don t want to create too much of an interest rate gap between the between the euro and the dollar     CEO Sergio Ermotti  Bank 
Canada is already beginning to raise rates
 Recognizing the lag between monetary policy actions and future inflation  Governing Council considers it appropriate to raise its overnight rate target at this time   
Central bank actions could impact currency markets
 the pace and timing of how central banks around the world proceed with normalization  and the importance of balance sheet policy relative to changes in short term rates in these normalization plans  could have important implications for exchange rates and financial conditions globally     Governor Lael Brainard  Central Bank 
British consumer confidence is currently quite volatile
 the customer is quite volatile and what do I mean by that  they are shopping very much for today we re seeing fluctuations on a weekly basis in departments like men s knitwear from sort of plus 50 to minus 20 on a weekly basis  depending on weathers  So  they re really are shopping for today consumer confidence overall  how they feel about themselves  is actually reasonably robust albeit it came down by about 5 or 6  over the last few weeks In terms of how they feel about the economic environment though  they still feel less robust about that as we move forward    CEO Steve Rowe  Retail

Yellen expects to start winding down the balance sheet  relatively soon 
 If the economy continues to evolve in line with our expectations  it is something we should begin to do this year  To my mind  I would say relatively soon  The exact timing of this  I do not think matters a great deal  It is something we have long been preparing to undertake     Chair Janet Yellen  Central Bank 
Caps will start at  10B per month and rise to  50B over the course of a year
 The cap will initially start at low levels   6 billion a month for treasuries and  4 billion a month for mortgage backed securities  And over the space of a year we will ramp that up to  20 billion for mortgage backed securities and  30 billion for treasuries     Chair Janet Yellen  Central Bank 
This process could go on until 2022
 I would say this process will play out probably to around 2022  when our balance sheet will probably be shrinking to normal levels Our balance sheet will end up substantially larger than it was before the crisis  but appreciably lower than it is now     Chair Janet Yellen  Central Bank 
It sounds like the Fed will focus on the Fed Funds rate if the economy deteriorates while normalization is under way
 the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had reached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions deteriorate  thus guarding against the risk of returning to the effective lower bound  ELB  in an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate     Governor Lael Brainard  Central Bank 
This is the end of an era
 we are at a  the end of that nine year era of continuous pressings down on interest rates and pushing out of money that created the liquidity fueled moves in the economies and markets  and b  the beginning of the late cycle phase of the business short term debt cycle  in which central bankers try to tighten at paces that are exactly right in order to keep growth and inflation neither too hot nor too cold  until they don t get it right and we have our next downturn  Recognizing that  our responsibility now is to keep dancing but closer to the exit and with a sharp eye on the tea leaves     Chairman Ray Dalio  Hedge Fund 
The risks may be greater than people think
 We ve never had QE like this before  we ve never had unwinding like this before  Obviously that should say something to you about the risk that might mean  because we ve never lived with it before  When that happens of size or substance  it could be a little more disruptive than people think  We act like we know exactly how it s going to happen and we don t    JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon  Bank 
Consumer 
Consumers want less carbonation and less sugar in their diets
 We continue to transform our beverage portfolio to offer more non carbonated options and reducing sugar levels across the portfolio    PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  CEO Indra Nooyi  Beverage 
QSR dining looks much different in China
 If you now come to China and visit a KFC you will be surprised of the number of people not standing in line but actually ordering on their phone just like you would at an airport where you check in at a machine  And also Alipay  WeChat have been very good at expanding their networks and promoting it well  As a result of that we believe China is far ahead of anybody else in terms of mobile payment    Yum China   NYSE YUMC  CEO Micky Pant  Restaurant 
Technology 
The Youtube Generation still prefers printed textbooks
 Printed textbooks are still the format of choice for most students While the evolution toward digital solutions has been slower than some originally anticipated  we saw an increasing shift toward a broader adoption of digital solutions in fiscal 2017   Barnes and Noble  NYSE BKS  CEO Max Roberts  Books 
Industrials 
Construction may be starting to slow
 We do have the expectation that construction nationally across all product types and all markets across country is likely to pullback a little bit and whether that number is 10  or 20  I don t know  but in talking with our customers they are passing that feedback along to me  cost of labor and materials in some markets are going up significantly  Cost of construction financing is going up So  it s costing more to build things and we are working against a period of years coming out of the great recession  where supply did not keep pace with demand and supply of product and lot of product types has caught up with demand now and lot of submarkets  So  there are lot of markets around the country where you might have had 5 projects coming to market a year ago  but there is really only a need for two more projects coming to market this year and that is slowing the volume to some extent    Bank of the Ozarks  NASDAQ OZRK  CEO George Gleason  Bank 
Manufacturers are paying up for productivity
 Most of our customers right now they are facing competitive threats  they need more productivity  they need to get product to markets faster  etcetera  etcetera  They are starving for productivity so what s actually happening like if you take our cutting tool portfolio  it s actually migrating up in quality of products  because in a lot of cases they are going to spend more for the product if they are going to get a much better length of cutter  the length of the tool life and the productivity coming out of the tool  And it s actually moving the other way towards high performance  So I think our core customers anyway the big lever for them is productivity and getting more output for less dollars   MSC Industrial Direct  NYSE MSM  CEO Erik Gershwind  Industrial Distributor 
Materials  Energy 
One oil company CEO says we could see  60 oil by the end of the year
 My personal view is we will probably edge back in the  60 range by the end of calendar 2017  I think it will be in the high 50s  low 60s  the amount of capital that s actually come out of spending programs  globally depends on who you read  but its on the order of  1 trillion to  2 trillion  and that capital is not being reinvested in  It will start to cause declines with some point  So while we do have production growth in the Permian and it s a fantastic resource  I do believe that the supply and other things will have a supply crunch at some point and we ll see high oil prices    TAG Oil  TO TAO CEO Toby Pierce  Energy

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Top Research Reports for Monday  Facebook  Verizon  Merck 

	The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Facebook  NASDAQ           Verizon  NYSE         and Merck  NYSE          These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see   

Facebook  s shares have outperformed the S P 500 index over the last one year  gaining  35 8  vs   13 1   Apart from mobile and video  the potential for monetization of its Instagram  Messenger  WhatsApp and Oculus assets  a huge user base and room for higher engagement levels remain at the core of the company s attractive fundamentals 

	Longer term  Facebook s investments in augmented reality virtual reality  AR VR  and artificial intelligence  AI  technologies also remain promising  On the flip side  Facebook has stated that revenues will now face tougher year over year comparisons  Stiffening competition for ad dollars is another major concern   You can      

	Shares of Verizon have been laggards over the past year    the stock is down  22 1  over the past 12 months vs  AT T  NYSE T  s  15 6  decline and the  13  gain for the S P 500 index  Verizon s underperformance reflects the market s concerns about the company s muddled strategy in the digital media domain and rising competitive pressures in its core U S  wireless business 

	The Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  purchase  as well as other previously acquired digital properties like AOL  Huffington Post will boost its digital media suite  The long term expectation is that these assets will give it a sizable enough platform to capture digital marketing dollars  The jury is still out on the long term viability of these efforts  but the company is also trying to be a player in the online TV streaming space and defend its leadership position in the wireless market through 5G wireless network trials 

	However  a full phased 5G wireless network will be offered only in 2020 The company s dividend appears safe  currently yields more than 5    but the inherent capital intensity of its core business and the need for purchases on the digital side ends up eating up more than it generates in its operations  In the updated research report issued today  the Zacks analyst discusses the pros and cons of investing in Verizon shares at present   You can      

	Buy rated Merck s shares have outperformed the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the last one year  gaining  5 4  versus the industry s  1 1  decline  This momentum reflects the progress it has made with product pipeline 

	While generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressures as are material in the Merck story as they are for many of its peers  the Zacks analyst points out that the company s new products like Keytruda and Zepatier hold great potential  Also  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line 

	Estimates have remained stable ahead of the company s Q2 earnings release  Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters  The Zacks analyst discusses all of these issues in the updated research report issued today   You can        

	Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Pepsi  NYSE          and HCA Healthcare  NYSE          

Now See All Our Private Trades

176910,398426,PEP,Opening Bell  Gold  Yen  Oil Fall  Asia Shares Rise On Low Volume,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Key Events

PepsiCo completed a Double Top reversal yesterday
Asia shares rise on low volume  as China extends declines on sluggish consumer prices
Oil below key  45 level
Kiwi sold off on missed spending data
Yen extends 3rd day decline on intervention and risk sentiment

Global equities have opened on cautious optimism ahead of the US earnings season  as shares in Asia crawl higher on low volume 
Global Affairs
Japanese and South Korean shares advanced 0 75 percent and 0 4 percent respectively with volume nearly a third below average  Australian shares fluctuated but remain flat  and Hong Kong shares climbed  their most in four months  gaining 1 45 percent on a rising gap 
Mainland Chinese equities have suffered a second day of losses  even after the release of a positive PPI report  after having failed to lead consumer prices an ever widening consumer led global growth issue  Examples of struggling growth can be seen in the US s stagnant wages  Canadian concerns over consumer stamina and UK consumer spending falling to lowest level in nearly four years even as the economic powerhouse Germany reported its consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in almost 16 years 
After opening higher  European shares erased earlier gains as oil failed to rally  dragging energy producers down with it 
Safe havens are still down on reflationary expectations 

The kiwi declined after spending data missed forecasts  allowing the dollar to climb back above its uptrend line since September 
The yen extended its third consecutive decline  upon a breakout of a H S reversal on central bank rhetoric of further intervention  As the go to safe haven asset  its fall affects reflationary risk on sentiment  following increasingly hawkish rhetoric by central banks 

Gold continued to decline  remaining suppressed below the neckline of a Double Top reversal for a third day  an event we forecast here  at the end of June 
Bonds slipped further  sending yields higher  to retest the 2 4 percent resistance level 
Oil managed to climb to  44 92  but was forced back down to  44 62  as of 3 39 EDT 
While rhetoric returned global equities to nearly all time highs  investors want to see profits through corporate earnings  PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   Citigroup  NYSE C  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  all report this week  These reports may reveal the catalyst to another rally that will beat previous all time highs  or offer a correction to a relatively stable market  Goldman Sachs Chief Asia Pacific strategist Tim Moe said on Bloomberg TV that he anticipates a slightly above expectation nine percent US earnings 
Pepsi beat profit expectations for the past 20 quarters by raising prices to offset declining volume  How long can they hope to create profits that are not based on growth  And having said that  are we actually still talking about Pepsi or about the stock market itself 
Perhaps it s appropriate that earnings open with Pepsi  as its growth dynamic mirrors the US equity market  The company is expected to report a core EPS of  1 40 based on revenue levels of  15 60 billion according to FactSet  up from  15 40 billion YoY 

Pepsi s stock has outperformed its peers and the broader market this year on account of its rising price and anticipation of a merger  How would the stock react if the merger potential goes away on lowered demand  Remember Twitter  NYSE TWTR   Its stock fell 35 percent from  25 to  16 between October 5 and 14 when hopes of a buyout evaporated  From a technical perspective  Pepsi completed a Double Top reversal  on high volume and with confirming momentum  in an expression that investors were in agreement when it comes to the price of this stock 
The US is also on unstable footing  as growth in the country has been consistently disappointing this year especially compared to Europe s unparalleled growth but investors are continuing to remain optimistic for now  After Trump s failed reflation  they have placed their faith in the Fed and its reflation rhetoric  while at the same time disregarding political risk and the flat economy 
The question is how long will they continue to believe things will get better  without seeing results  While the headline calls attention to stocks holding up near all time highs  their momentum has markedly diminished  One of the key sectors leading the rise in equities  tech  has completed a top its rally this week is nothing more than a correction  which is expected to extend its declines  The first leg was seen on June 9 and the second leg occurred between June 26 and July 6 
Investors will still tune in to today s Fedspeak to listen for any potential mixed signals  as FOMC member Lael Brainard discusses normalizing balance sheets at 12 30 EDT  while Neel Kashkari who voted against the June interest rate hike speaks at 13 20

176925,398441,PEP,How To Interpret Big Oil s Support For A Carbon Tax,opinion,Last week  several oil and gas majors supported a Republican led council s plan to tax carbon emissions in a bid to fight global warming  ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM    together with peers Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   and TOTAL SA   NYSE TOT   announced that they are backing the idea to penalize carbon dioxide emissions as a way to combat the threat of climate change and returning the money to taxpayers in the form of a  dividend  The Carbon Tax and Dividend PlanThe plan  unveiled by the  in February  calls for a bipartisan policy to fight global warming by imposing a fee of  40 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted and return the revenue collected to U S  taxpayers as a monthly climate dividend  The tax is slated to rise over time  dampening demand for fossil fuels by making energy derived from them dearer  The ultimate aim is a quick transition toward renewable energy and other low carbon solutions  while making them price competitive   Led by senior Republican statesmen James Baker III and George Schulz  the Climate Leadership Council s individual founding members include green energy proponents like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg  physicist Stephen Hawking  former Energy Secretary Steven Chu  businessman Vinod Khosla  and former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers  The coalition is also endorsed by corporate giants like General Motors Company   NYSE GM    Unilever plc   NYSE UL    Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   and PepsiCo Inc    NYSE PEP    However  what stands out is the presence of some of the biggest energy companies joining the call advocating for a progressively rising carbon tax Environmentalists Scoff Energy Companies  Support to the Plan Green groups and climate campaigners have been quick to dismiss the proposal and the oil companies  support of it as a scam and public relations gimmick aimed at shielding themselves from liabilities associated with previous emissions  In particular  environmentalists point to a clause within the new regulation that allows the energy explorers to escape legal consequences for the role they have played in fueling pollution and climate change  This is of particular interest to the likes of ExxonMobil   currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold    and Shell   both investigated for allegedly misleading investors on climate change  You can see  Some observers also argued that a carbon tax levy is part of the big natural gas producers  efforts to increase their market share of the commodity at the expense of coal  In fact  coal s carbon content per unit of energy is double that of natural gas and therefore under the planned environmental law  most coal fired electric utilities will be asked to use more of less emitting natural gas  Incidentally  natural gas accounts for a substantial portion of ExxonMobil  Shell  BP and TOTAL s production and trading activities      Arguing that the years of  deception  and  fraud  cannot be shielded behind the garb of climate activism  critics are of the opinion that the tax is  dead on arrival  in any case  with almost zero probability of the current Republican Congress passing it  With President Trump deciding to opt out of the Paris climate change accord and EPA head Scott Pruitt rolling back a number of regulations on climate change  enacting the nation s first carbon tax plan remains highly unlikely Or Is There More to It Than Meets the Eye To be fair to the oil majors  they have admitted the ill effects of carbon emissions and have publicly voiced their support for the Paris climate agreement Secretary of State and former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson had been a long advocate of a carbon tax as a way of addressing climate change concerns  Tillerson s stand on climate change is opposed to that of Trump s who supports the fossil fuel industry and is least concerned about climate change Even Europe s largest energy company Shell has been vocal in its efforts to reduce operational carbon footprint  According to Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben van Beurden  the transition to a carbon light regime will take time and government initiatives   including a carbon tax   will be required to discontinue using the most polluting sources of energy like coal and oil  Walking the talk  the Anglo Dutch major  which is working hard to rebrand itself as a natural gas company  has pledged to increase its investment in renewable energy to  1 billion annually by 2020 though the amount is still negligible compared to its yearly capital expenditure of  25 billion Bottom LineWhile one must admit that the fossil fuel companies  motives in supporting the carbon tax plan is complicated to say the least  public trust deficit is the  biggest challenge  facing them  which  in turn  could jeopardize their long term future  Despite all  good intentions   lack of tangible developments toward cleaner fuels might irk stakeholders  as the societal acceptance of the current energy order continue to disappear Sell These Stocks  Now Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our

176977,398493,PEP,PepsiCo Issues A 2017 Cautious Guidance,opinion,"The Snacks And Beverage Company  Despite Ending 2016 With Healthy Sales And Revenue  Is Offering Up A More Cautious  Weaker Outlook For This Year 
Packaged food and beverage titan PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  Inc  finishes a successful year of coinciding and even beating its own and analysts  revenue and earnings targets in its recent fourth quarter earnings release  but with a much quieter outlook for 2017 
While the company expects continued modest growth in revenue and earnings per share  EPS   a muted outlook is forecasted due to PepsiCo management s cautious approach toward the global macroeconomic environment for this year 
PepsiCo quarterly earnings
On Wednesday  the snacks and beverage conglomerate reported that net revenue climbed 5   bringing the revenue for 2016 at  62 8 billion  Compared with the same period in the preceding year  PepsiCo s top line was essentially flat  as the company delivered  63 1 billion in revenue in 2015 
Organic revenue and a 53rd reporting week in 2016  edged higher by 3 7  for both the fourth quarter and the full year  This coincided with the company s goal of reaching an approximate of 4  organic revenue growth in 2016 
Operating income grew by an estimated 5  versus 2015 s fourth quarter  The growth resulted mostly from the leverage contributed by additional sales  as gross margin and operating margin were flat 
Meanwhile  the net income and weak earnings per share downticks were driven by interest expense and taxes  interest expense increased a hefty 88  to  594 million  While higher debt balances contributed to this rise  the Mountain Dew and Cheetos producer also recorded a  233 million charge to interest expense during the fourth quarter  when it redeemed  2 25 billion of senior notes due in 2018 and 2019 
Income tax expense moved higher by 90  to  414 million  with the difference stemming from a net tax advantage the same period a year earlier  In 2016  PepsiCo notched a record of a one time   230 million non cash tax benefit when it fixed tax troubles from 2010 and 2011 with the IRS  and accordingly lowered a reserve for ambiguous tax positions 
PepsiCo also continued to generate an attractive cash flow of  10 4 billion for the full year  nearing its 2015 mark of  10 6 billion  During the same period  the snack and beverage corporation incurred capital expenditures amounting to  3 0 billion  Management decided to return most of the net  7 4 billion of free cash flow to shareholders during the year  PepsiCo paid out  4 2 billion in dividends 
PepsiCo raised its dividend by 7  to  3 22 per share  effective with the future June 2017 dividend  This will lift the effective yield on PEP shares from 2 8  to 3   given the current share price 
PepsiCo products
PepsiCo is the parent company of Pepsi  Frito Lay and Tropicana  The company s two biggest divisions  Frito Lay North America  FLNA  and North America Beverages  NAB   helped boost overall company performance  The two sectors delivered organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 3  and 2   respectively  In total  FLNA s sales of  4 9 billion and NAB s sales of  6 3 billion covered 57  of PepsiCo s total top line in the quarter 
During the PepsiCo s earnings conference call with analysts  management indicated a number of visible results of its effort to liberate itself from the fortunes of its decreasing soda volumes  CEO Indra Nooyi remarked that Naked Juice is close to becoming the company s next   1 billion brand   He also revealed that in 2016  the company s Everyday Nutrition products accounted for 25  of net revenue  compared with the Pepsi Cola trademark which only comprised just 12  
PepsiCo management remarks  outlook
After hitting its full year target of nearly 4  organic growth and reporting adjusted EPS of  4 85 that marks a 6  year over year increase  PepsiCo management offered up a more cautious 2017 outlook  The firm projects 3  organic revenue growth this year  and adjusted EPS of  5 09  which would indicate a 5  increase over 2016 
What caused the weaker than expected forecast performance is partially stemming from expectations of continued currency effects  which have dragged PepsiCo s results over the past two years 
However  it also represents a more doubtful attitude from management about the current global environment for consumer goods establishments  At the conservative guidance  shares of PepsiCo fell as much as 2  to  104 77 in Wednesday s trading session  The stock ended the trade with a 0 18  loss to  106 73  and recovered meekly with 0 02  in premarket hours today ",2017-02-16,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico-issues-a-2017-cautious-guidance-200175952,200175952
177007,398523,PEP,Change In Coca Cola  KO  Leadership In Focus,opinion,"Ahead of the bell this morning we learned the CEO for Coca Cola   Muhtar Kent  will be stepping down after 8 years  He ll be replaced by Coca Cola s current President  51 year old James Quincey  The changing of leadership is scheduled to take place May 1  2017 
Coca Cola has had its issues in the market recently   since the surprise Trump victory for President of the U S   multi national corporations have been rotated out of in favor of domestic oriented small caps  which don t have the same risk factors in terms of trade tariffs  etc    but shares are up nearly 1  on this news in the pre market  It s a sudden announcement  but one which looks contained by the company s board of directors 
Muhtar Kent s tenure existed over the time period that matches the aftermath of the Great Recession  As such  we ve seen shares of  21 ramp up over time to just below  41 as of yesterday s close  in other words  we ve seen a nearly 100  gain at the time of Kent s announcement to step down from the head of the firm  The company routinely beats earnings estimates  at least for the past several quarters  though modestly on average 
Year over year growth estimates are negative for this quarter  next  and the coming fiscal years 2016 and 2017  This may require the new CEO  Quincey  to look to acquire companies with synergies to the main brand  This would more closely follow what Pepsico  NYSE PEP   has been involved with over the past few years 
We are seeing modestly positive opens ahead of today s bell  the Trump rally seems to have little in its way at this point  Analysts don t seem to think we ve gone toward too much too soon  although Joh Blank s most recent strategy takes this possibility into account ",2016-12-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/change-in-coca-cola-(ko)-leadership-in-focus-200169172,200169172
177008,398524,PEP,5 Stocks To Watch Before The Market Opens,opinion,"Groupon Inc  NASDAQ GRPN   After posting modest improvements in the first half of 2016  the stock slid 34  to cap off 2016  Groupon    shares slipped in the final 6 months despite a better than expected third quarter that topped consensus estimates on Wall Street  Nonetheless revenue growth continues to come in virtually flat while earnings posted triple digit declines for three consecutive quarters  Gross billings  a key metric for the online marketplace  fell 2  during the quarter from  1 47 billion to  1 43 billion 
The largest drag came from international markets namely EMEA which declined by 10   Rest of the World declined by 24 while North America gross billings jumped 6   Analysts expect ongoing restructuring efforts as well as new holiday TV campaigns and marketing promotions to have a positive effect on the quarter to be reported  Moreover the acquisition of LivingSocial should be accretive to financial performance  But Amazon s dominance in the space plus intensifying competition puts stress on Groupon s prospects in the coming years 
PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Eating habits greatly changed in the past handful of years to favor healthy options with organic ingredients  As a result soda maker and snacks provider PepsiCo    experienced a marked downturn  with revenue comparisons trending south of zero for 8 consecutive quarters  In the third quarter revenue declined by nearly 2  on weakness in foreign markets  particularly Venezuela  while organic revenue maintained a steady climb higher 
With regards to Wednesday s report  investors will be looking for progress on new non carbonated beverage offerings aimed at offsetting weak CSD volumes  Some of those improvements might come from strategic acquisitions to grow its non carbonated beverage portfolio  In late 2017 Pepsi signed a deal to acquire fermented probiotic and kombucha beverage market KeVita  a move expected to carry accretive effects  The snacks business faces a similar battle  consumers are moving in waves to healthy snacks like kale chips in lieu of traditional potato chips 
Sodastream International Ltd  NASDAQ SODA   After years of flat earnings  SodaStream    managed to post one of the biggest turnarounds in 2016  The beverage maker topped analysts expectations in each quarter since FQ4 2015  thanks to a greater focus on healthy water based offerings 
SodaStream now promotes itself as a seltzer water beverage dispensary rather than a direct competitor to Coke or Pepsi  In the third quarter sparkling water maker unit sales grew by 23  from a year earlier  Analysts expect this ongoing trend to continue into future quarters and help support top and bottom line growth  As always  weak FX translation and uncertainty in Europe remain near term headwinds to financial performance 
Shopify Inc  NYSE SHOP   Shopify    ripped through 2016 with stock prices increasing nearly 200  on the back of strong quarterly results  Analysts expect this ongoing trend to continue in 2017 despite the ongoing trouble retailers face from volatile consumer spending and intensifying competition 
In the third quarter subscription solutions revenue grew by 69  along with a resounding 114  increase in merchant solution sales  Gross merchandise volume increased by 100  to  3 8 billion  with about  1 5 billion coming by way of Shopify Payments  That said  if customer expansion starts to stall  it won t be long before share prices and quarterly results follow 
Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc  NYSE HLT   Shares of Hilton    jumped 50  in the past 12 months as travel trends started to exhibit new signs of growth  But given results from travel stocks this earnings season came in largely mixed  it remains unclear whether the industry is improving or deteriorating  Hilton and the other hotel operators look to set the record straight with robust fourth quarter reports through the week 
Hilton s strong international exposure as well as improving group business trends expect to drive key metrics like RevPAR  revenue per available room  higher  But analysts still expect RevPAR to come in flat compared to a year earlier  largely hampered by weak oil and gas markets  macroeconomic uncertainty and ongoing currency headwinds ",2017-02-15,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-tomorrow-200175719,200175719

Key Takeaways 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 31 on  15 45 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  40 on the top
The soda industry has been under pressure lately  as health conscious consumers opt for alternative beverages that do not include sugar or artificial sweeteners
Non carbonated beverages and salty snacks are Pepsi s two biggest growth markets  expected to carry the company s future growth
What are you expecting for  
Snack and beverage manufacturer  PepsiCo  is prepared to report second quarter earnings Thursday  before the market opens  With a better than expected Q1  Pepsi has topped earnings expectations in 7 of the last 8 quarters 
Early indications suggests Pepsi should continue to see strong organic growth driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies  new cost cutting controls  and innovative product offerings  The stock has tracked this positive momentum and is now up 12  over the past 12 months 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  1 31 on  15 45 billion in revenue  3 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  40 on the top  At the current estimates  this represents a decline in both earnings and sales compared to a year earlier 
Shareholders have still reacted positively to earnings regardless of weak year over year comparisons  Through earnings and 30 days following a report  Pepsi stock has typically increased 1  

After a weak Q4 Pepsi rebounded with better than expected Q1 earnings  The quarter featured a 3 5 increase in organic revenue driven by effective marketing initiatives  new product launches and its focus on greater efficiency  The company s snack sector has been its highest growth area with Frito Lay manning the helm 
On the beverage side  the business has seen a nice boost from productivity gains and lower raw material costs  However  continued currency headwinds and changing consumer preferences have taken its toll on global performance  Soda consumption in the U S  has reached all time lows which hasn t done Pepsi and larger rival Coca Cola any favors 
Overall the Consumer Soft Drinks  CSD  sector has seen volume and revenue decline in 11 consecutive quarters  Persisting global volatility and currency headwinds should continue to pressure Pepsi s soft drink sales 
It will be important to watch whether Pepsi guides for lower sales and earnings for the remainder of the year following Brexit uncertainty  The company is already expecting its Venezuelan division to have a 2  negative impact on earnings this year  Pepsi has done a good job to withstand macroeconomic risk but its look as if it will be catching up to them in the near future ",2016-07-07,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-pepsi-still-have-its-fizz-200140381,200140381

177109,398625,PEP,Pepsico Trade Ideas Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"It s 90 degrees today and even though I usually prefer water  this Pepsi looks fantastic  But that bottle of soda represents the past for PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   which sells more water than soft drinks  And it sells a wide variety of snack foods too  like Doritos and Lay s potato chips  The company is also reporting earnings before Thursday s open 
Heading into the report  the stock is at an all time high  The chart shows a pullback in May that found support at 100 and then a march higher  interrupted briefly by the Brexit shock  Broadly  the stock has traded between 90 and 100 for nearly 2 years  Since February it has remained above the 200 day SMA  a broad signal of bullishness 
Momentum indicators show bullish support as well  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is rising  Neither are anywhere near extremes  The Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside  This allows the stock price to rise  But recent price action ahead of earnings give a pause  Is a possible double top in the making 
Options chains show a focus of open interest this week from 104 to 108 on the call side  The put side is heftiest at 104 and 105 with some also down to 100  The at the money straddle suggests options traders expect a  2 10 move by Friday  That gives a range of 103 70 to 108 as I write  July monthly options are heavily focused at the 105 Strike  These suggest little or no movement this week or next

177111,398627,PEP,Favorable ADP Data,opinion,"June s private sector payroll report from ADP  was released this morning  topping analyst estimates of 151K by posting 172K new jobs last month  May s ADP tally was revised downward by 5000 jobs to 168K 

The biggest pickup was in Services   up 208K in June  including Trade Transportation Utilities up 55K and Professional Business Services up 51K  Goods fell 36K for the month  with Manufacturing jobs down 21K and Construction  5K  Like last month  these numbers suggest the U S  remains near full employment 

Weekly jobless claims this morning look to back up this notion  as well  The 254K jobless claims reported for June represents a 16K drop from the revised totals for May  As we are now in the summer months  we may be seeing a skew related to the shortened holiday week  but we nevertheless have not seen new jobless claims numbers in the U S  since the early 1970s 
Now for the Important Question

So  what does all this mean for tomorrow s non farm payroll June Jobs Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS   Most clearly  it continues to advance the narrative that May s paltry 38K jobs gains was a mere blip  or an aberration  My esteemed colleague John Blank pointed out yesterday to me in conversation that because the May BLS payroll report was released on June 3rd  there may not have been ample time to receive all the data from around the country  It would not be the first time we have seen this sort of thing  either 

This would seem to bear out based on these latest ADP and jobless claims reads  but we ll know for sure when the BLS report comes out before the bell tomorrow  Basically  another report vastly beneath 100K new jobs for the month of June would signal something is amiss   not least of all the sudden disparity between monthly jobless indexes 

Occam s Razor is the dictum that the simplest answer to a question is most often the correct one  So instead of attempting to twist our logic into a pretzel that something invisible and destructive in the U S  labor market is afoot   which by definition could only marginally be affected by Brexit  which didn t happen until after the May jobs report anyway   we expect to see a big correction on tomorrow s non farm payroll totals  That s what the analysts are betting on  anyway

177175,398691,PEP,PepsiCo Could Be On The Verge Of A Crash ,opinion,"Just as with any other stock  PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  took a hard hit during the 2007 2009 recession  But the company managed to survive and the stock began steadily recovering 
Between March 2009 and now  the price of PepsiCo shares has more than doubled  From 45 40 seven years ago to 105 72 last month  the bad days seem to be long forgotten  There seems to be no reason to worry as the stock is hovering near all time highs above the 100 dollar mark 
However  we believe PepsiCo investors ought to be worried  As the  will demonstrate on the chart below  the company s shares could be on the verge of a crash  Turns out the entire 7 year rally since the bottom in 2009 could be seen as a five wave impulse  Impulses show the direction of the larger trend  Nevertheless  the Wave principle says that every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  before the larger trend resumes  If we apply this rule to the above shown chart  we will see that once wave  5  of the uptrend is over  a decline of similar degree could be expected  In addition  the relative strength index is showing a double bearish divergence between the tops of waves 3   3  and  5  of the sequence  which further supports the negative outlook 
Wave  5  has already exceeded the top of wave  3   So far  it appears to be taking the shape of an ending diagonal  PepsiCo might reach one last new high  but once the pattern is over  a  swift and sharp reversal  should follow  In the longer term  the stock could lose over 25   which means the support area between 80 00 and 75 00 could be visited 
So  instead of highly optimistic  PepsiCo investors should be very careful  because such a sell off in the company s stock could ruin their entire portfolio ",2016-05-03,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico-on-the-verge-of-a-crash-200127527,200127527

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  1 09 and revenue of  18 663 billion  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates
Half of Pepsico s revenue comes from global operations which have been adversely impact from weaker macroeconomic conditions and the stronger dollar 
Frito Lay has carried the slumping soda maker as snack sales continue to grow
Pepsico is scheduled to report fourth quarter earnings before the bell on February 11  The soft drink maker is coming off yet another strong quarter of earnings despite a higher than expected impact from currency headwinds  In fact  the company has beat bottom line estimates each of the past 8 quarters  That said  expectations for this quarter are low as beverage sales volume continues to shrink due to the stronger dollar  increasing volatility in emerging markets and a shift in consumer preferences for healthy alternatives  The Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  1 09 and revenue of  18 663 billion  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates of  0 06 and  18 592 billion  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY contraction in EPS and revenue of 2  and 5   respectively  With around half of its revenues coming from overseas  Pepsi s sales and profits have been significantly impacted from global volatility  The strength Pepsi s snack business is expected to help soften the blow from poor international performance 

Growing health concerns have put a damper on Pepsico s carbonated drink sales growth  The soda industry has been under pressure as health conscious consumers opt for alternative beverages that do not include sugar or artificial sweeteners  Although Pepsi has increased marketing investments to boost its beverage business  these efforts have yet to result in any meaningful improvement  Moreover  Pepsi expects to continue to face macroeconomic headwinds due to weaker international currency and an economic slowdown in emerging markets  Sales in Latin America  a major Pepsico market  have largely been stagnant as these countries head into a recession  In the upcoming quarters  currency movements are expected to impact Pepsico s top and bottom line by 8  

Offsetting some of the losses  Pepsico s snack business  Frito Lay  is expected to ring up sales and volume growth  Among all of Pepsico s brands  Frito Lay has been the only segment to consistently turn a profit  Lately  the snack business has been almost twice as profitable for Pepsi than beverages  Besides potato chips  the company is expanding its health brands to meet changing consumer preferences  Pepsico has shown a propensity to expand and adapt to changing times and notwithstanding weaker macroeconomic conditions  the company could surprise investors ",2016-02-11,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-pepsi-beat-on-its-q4-earnings-here’s-what-to-watch-384128,384128

And those mountains of grub will turn into mountains of cash for certain food companies 
This week s chart digs into exactly how much food is consumed on Super Bowl Sunday  The results are staggering 
As the Panthers take on the Broncos  Americans will collectively eat a pile of nachos larger than the Super Bowl halftime stage 
We ll also eat 682 charter buses  worth of potato chips 
You d be hard pressed to find a Super Bowl party that doesn t feature a bowl of Tostitos  Doritos  Ruffles or Cheetos  That means big money for the owner of these popular chip brands  Frito Lay   a division of PepsiCo  NYSE  N PEP  
PepsiCo also owns Gatorade and  of course  Pepsi  You re likely to see commercials for all of these products during the big game  And if that weren t enough publicity  for the fourth consecutive year  PepsiCo is sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show 
Clearly this strategy is paying off  Shortly after last year s Super Bowl  PepsiCo shares jumped nearly 7  
Of course  PepsiCo isn t the only food company geared up to profit   
As Matthew Carr pointed out earlier this week  Super Bowl Sunday is the No  1 pizza selling day of the year  Companies like Domino s Pizza Group Plc  N DPZ  should make a pretty penny 
 Domino s alone will sell 11 million slices of pizza on Sunday   Matthew writes   And its delivery drivers will log more than 4 million miles

177238,398754,PEP,Time To Buy A Pepsi,opinion,"Lately I have seen Pepsico  NYSE PEP  described as a snack food company  And with that they are somehow benefiting from falling oil prices  I had to stop what I was doing for a minute after that one  I guess they do sell a lot of snacks  But they are also a water company with Aquafina 
When I was young they were known solely as the the maker of Pepsi soft drinks  With all this expansion into the consumer maybe it should not be a surprise that the company is doing well  But the chart of the company s stock price shows that it is also doing well  In fact  it looks like a great time to grab some Pepsico stock 

During the back half of 2013 and into the first quarter of 2014  Pepsico stock went through a consolidation pattern  It traded in a channel for 7 months and then the price action started to tighten against the downside support of the channel  This made for a descending triangle  it broke above the top resistance of the triangle in early March 2014 and moves  22 higher  touching  100 in the process 
Since the beginning of December  the stock has been going through a variation of that same pattern again  That was until today  The stock is now moving over that falling resistance again  And with the prior move up as a guide  sets a target of 115 
The momentum indicators support more upside price action as well  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising  The MACD is about to cross up again after a short pause in its move higher  Using the May high as a trigger for a conservative entry or getting in now against a stop at the July 27 low gives a great reward to risk ratio for this stock

177258,398774,PEP,PepsiCo Earnings Put These ETFs In Focus,opinion,"Sizzling Q2 earnings from the beverage giant PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  petered out on the stock exchange yesterday  Despite beating on both lines and raising the guidance  the beverage bellwether failed to quench investors  thirst due to prospective strength in the greenback 
With around half of its revenues originating outside the U S  border  Pepsi s sales and profits are highly vulnerable to currency headwinds  And as the Fed likely to hike rates sometime later in 2015  depreciation of many foreign currencies against the U S  dollar will likely hit the company in the second half 
Impressive PEP Earnings   Guidance hike
On July 9  PepsiCo beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues  Not only this  the food and beverage behemoth raised the previously issued 2015 constant currency earnings guidance backed by the strong first half performance and upbeat business outlook expected for the rest of the year 
Pepsi s second quarter core earnings per share of  1 32 easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 23 by 7 3   Earnings were  however  flat year over year as currency headwinds took a bite out of sales 
Total sales of  15 92 billion   down 6  year over year   beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  15 81 billion  It was adverse currency translation which weighed on total revenue growth as currency concerns ate away 10  from revenue growth  However  negative currency translation was lower than 11  expected previously 
Excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions  1    revenues increased 5  on an organic basis as higher price mix gains made up for softer volumes  Effective net pricing gain of 5   which was higher than 4  in the past quarter  was probably the reason for the beat as volumes underperformed 
Pepsi now expects core constant currency earnings per share to increase 8  in 2015  up from 7  guided earlier  The target is in tune with the long term management goal of high single digit core constant currency earnings growth 
However  the negative point was that the currency is expected to mar both earnings per share and revenues by 11  and 9  in 2015  respectively  In February  the company expected a 7  adverse impact on earnings  The PepsiCo stock was down about 1 1  in the key trading session of July 9  though it added about 0 5  after hours

Social and digital marketing

 We expanded our engagement in social and digital marketing  For example  Doritos CrashTheSuperBowl received nearly 5 000 consumer submissions from 29 countries around the world  And our Lays Do Us A Flavor campaign garnered more than 14 million submissions  Programs like these drive phenomenal consumer engagement  are highly complementary to our broader marketing efforts and are extremely financially efficient  Our investments are translating to tangible results with solid improvement in brand equity scores and market share performance in our priority markets for our global brands  

Higher inflation in non market traded commodities

 In terms of headwinds  we anticipate commodity cost inflation in the low single digits  Keep in mind that because of our forward buying strategies  our commodity cost changes will lag what you see in the spot market  I believe our expected inflation rate is a bit higher than what a number of you have modeled and this is because we are seeing more pronounced inflation in our non market traded commodities  including certain packaging and agricultural raw materials  In addition  we will see an inflation impact from transaction ForEx in many of the markets whose currencies have weakened against the dollar  And foreign exchange translation will be a significant drag on our U S  dollar earnings  

Pepsi and Frito Lay merged in 1965

 This year marks the 50th anniversary of the coming together of PepsiCo  NYSE PEP  and Frito Lay in 1965  We set the foundation for what is today one of the world s most iconic and successful companies    

Only 79 of the Fortune 500 in 1965 still remain

 It was a phenomenal vision of Don Kendall and Herman Lay  the architects of this combination  which set the stage to grow from  510 million in revenue in 1965 to almost  67 billion today  Of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 1965 just 79 remain today  and over this time frame  we ve generated extraordinary shareholder returns  

Juice business is very different in Europe than it is in the States

 The Tropicana line up we sell in France and the UK is a very different line up than we sell here in the U S  because the juice business evolved very  very differently there  

It takes time for lower gas prices to make their way back

 In terms of the impact of gas prices  I think what we see happening is consistent with what we ve seen in the past which is   it takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so called benefit from lower gas prices  I think you re going to see that over the course of six months to eight months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior  It just sort of assimilates over time

177305,398821,PEP,A Company That Is A Solid Pick for Any Long Term Portfolio,opinion,"The numbers are piling in  and there have been some disappointments as usual  This is why individual stock selection always matters in a portfolio  and equity investors should be willing to make changes depending on what stage of the business cycle a company is experiencing 
One company that s proven itself to be a good business to own is PepsiCo  Inc   Pepsico Inc  NYSE PEP    It s a brand name mature enterprise with an excellent track record of long term  reliable wealth creation for stockholders  It s not the fastest growing large cap in the marketplace  but the snacks and beverage business is consistent and so are the dividends 
Wall Street and institutional investors would love to see PepsiCo spin off its food and snacks business from beverages  similar to what recently transpired with Kraft Foods Incorporated 
A spin off would  no doubt  be a boon to shareholders  but I don t see it happening  because the company s management needs the profits from Quaker foods  oatmeal  and especially  Frito Lay   potato chips  to help with the slow growth world of soda and juice 
PepsiCo s organic global snacks sales grew five percent comparatively in the second quarter of 2014 and two percent for global beverages 
Currency translation was unfavorable during the most recent quarter  bringing the growth rates down to two percent for global snacks and a decline of one percent for global beverages 
But despite the slow growth  the company s operating margin improved a solid 10  during the second quarter  and that s the big story that got the shares moving on the earnings report 
PepsiCo s two year stock chart is featured below 

The company also boosted its full year 2014 earnings per share growth outlook to eight percent comparatively  up from seven percent previously 
Management is planning approximately  5 0 billion in share repurchases this calendar year and some  3 7 billion in dividends paid 
PepsiCo has increased its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years and recently declared a quarterly dividend of  0 655 per share  up 15  over the same period last year  which is material 
Combined share repurchases of  8 7 billion this calendar year represents a 35  increase over 2013  and it s why big investors keep investing in this mature enterprise On share price weakness or a correction  I think PepsiCo s shares make for a welcome addition to any quality long term stock market portfolio  And the company is also a good candidate for dividend reinvestment if stockholders do not require the quarterly dividend income 
While all equities are speculative securities  PepsiCo stock isn t for risk capital traders  This is a long haul position in a retirement portfolio or a modest income paying stock while in retirement 
The company s bottom line earnings beat Wall Street consensus  and that s all the marketplace needed to bid the shares 
A lot of stocks have been selling off on good financial results and it s so reasonable  because prices have gone up tremendously in advance of corporate reporting 
Nobody expects PepsiCo to produce highflying growth  of course  but once again  the company delivered and the Street was happy 
With an aggressive dividend and share repurchase program  this company should continue to be a solid wealth creator for investors

177322,398838,PEP,With Fizzling Sales In US And EU Pepsico Looks To China For Growth ,opinion,"Pepsico Inc   NYSE PEP  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Thursday  April 17th  Pepsico is an American multinational beverage company best known for its flagship Pepsi brand  Revenue estimates for Pepsico are lower this quarter than FQ1 last year as Beverage Digest claims that overall soda consumption fell 3  last year  Despite the broad weakness in soda sales in the US and Europe  Coca Cola s earnings report from earlier this week suggests China may be an area of growth  Declining soda sales in Europe and flat sales in the States were offset for Coke by burgeoning consumption in the world s most populated country which pushed sales above Wall Street s expectations  Look for growth in China and Asia and expect sales in the US and Europe to remain mundane  Here s what investors expect from Pepsico on Thursday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Pepsi to report 75c EPS and  12 467B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 18 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 78c EPS and  12 642B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Pepsi to beat the Wall Street consensus on both the top and bottom line by a moderate margin 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Pepsi s EPS everytime and has been more accurate in forecasting revenue twice  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a moderate difference between the two groups expectations 
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 74c to 90c EPS and from  12 441B to  14 000B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a moderate distribution of EPS estimates and a wide range of revenue estimates on Pepsico 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean more volatility post earnings  
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 79c to 75c while the Estimize consensus pulled back from 82c to 78c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus dropped from a high of  12 841B to  12 467B while the Estimize forecast plummeted from  13 067B to  12 642B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bearish indicators 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 76c EPS and  12 630B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked  among over 4 000 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59  and 55  of the time respectively 1643 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting Pepsi to beat Wall Street s expectations but fail to live up to the Estimize community s EPS consensus 
Coca Cola s recent earnings report from Tuesday should give us an idea of what to expect out of Pepsico  Coca Cola reported flat soda sales in the US and a decline in Europe alongside encouraging demand growth in China  Wall Street expects Pepsico s sales to drop compared to last year but the Estimize community s consensus is moderately higher than the Street s  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting Pepsico to beat Wall Street s forecast by 3c per share EPS and  175 million in revenue

177337,398853,PEP,PepsiCo  Equity Market Super Stock Adding Up To Solid Returns,opinion,One company I consistently like for long term investors looking for dividend payments is PepsiCo  Inc   PEP    This is the kind of company that can be put into retirement accounts and held for long periods of time with dividend reinvestment   The equity market has been very kind to PepsiCo since the beginning of this year  Like many blue chips  it has ridden a wave of enthusiasm by institutional investors looking to bid the equity market with the safest names   PepsiCo offers safety as a corporation with an array of beverage products that are sold worldwide  The many brands that the company maintains are complemented by its snack business  The two businesses go hand in hand   As a multinational company  currency translation plays a big role in its numbers  In the first quarter of 2013  organic revenue growth was a solid 4 4   but after currency translation  this fell to a mere one percent   The company s Americas Foods division was the highlight  producing organic revenue growth of six percent  five percent after currency translation   PepsiCo experienced business growth in all its Americas Foods segments  which include Frito Lay North America  Quaker Foods North America  and Latin America Foods   PepsiCo s first quarter financial results beat consensus  and big investors celebrated the modest stability   The equity market has generally been a consistent accumulator of shares in this company  Featured below is PepsiCo s 25 year stock chart  adjusted for splits  Consistent with its previous guidance for 2013  the company expects seven percent growth in its core constant currency earnings per share this year  Combined with its dividend yield of nearly three percent  that s a decent equity market prospect from such a mature and relatively safe corporation   PepsiCo plans to spend  6 4 billion in dividends and share repurchases this year  With a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of around 17 and a trailing P E of approximately 21  PepsiCo is fully priced   This company is one of my long term  super stocks  great blue chip companies that offer earnings growth  dividends  and capital preservation   I m a big believer in dividend reinvestment for a long term portfolio  While saving for retirement  you can increase your total returns significantly with automatic dividend reinvestment plans  And once you re retired  you can stay in the equity market if you choose and use those dividends for income If you bought PepsiCo in August of 2009  your simple return to date would be around 43   With dividend reinvestment into new shares of the company  your return jumps to 60   recognizing that 2009 was an exceptional base for the equity market  There are plenty of super stocks out there to consider in a correction  and the soda  beverage  and snack market is a good one PepsiCo s corporate outlooks and equity market returns are generally quite reliable ,2013-06-07,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pepsico:-equity-market-super-stock-adding-up-to-solid-returns-170343,170343

177424,398940,PEP,China s Rising Imports of American Goods,opinion,"As Americans in the 1970s sang that they d like to  teach the world to sing   Coca Cola was entering the Chinese market  More than 30 years later  China is the beverage company s third largest market  and Coca Cola is still seeing modest growth in China 
Many other U S  companies have been growing in China over the past several years  In fact  USA Today recently reported that China is America s third largest export market  with the total U S  exports of electronic  agricultural and other products to China rising an astounding 468 percent from 2000 to 2010 
In recent months  however  China s imports have slowed following the strong rebound in 2009  On a year over year basis in October 2011  China s total exports increased only 15 9 percent compared to total imports  which grew 28 7 percent  This difference compares favorably to October 2008  when imports decreased significantly more than exports  This discrepancy is not surprising  given the fact that Europe is China s largest export market  according to Stratfor Global Intelligence 
In light of China s domestic demand continuing  we took a look at a few U S  companies in the consumer goods area that stand to benefit 
As traditional tea drinkers  Chinese have been slowly broadening their beverage options over the past 10 years and U S  multinational companies have been reaping the rewards  Companies such as have enjoyed success in converting the tea lovers to consumers of other beverages  including coffee  juice and carbonated drinks 
When it comes to coffee in China  most of the purchases are made from retail outlets  in the form of processed or instant coffee  and bought from mainly two U S  companies  Nestle and Kraft  Together they account for more than 80 percent of the market share in China  according to data from CLSA Asia Pacific Markets Research group  However  coffee consumption remains far lower than consumption in the U S  and Hong Kong  As you can see below  on a per capita basis from 2005 through 2010  while GDP has grown  consumption of coffee remains near zero 

While CLSA doesn t anticipate the Chinese to consume much more than 3 kilograms of coffee  the research firm indicates that the Chindonesian markets together  still have at least two decades left of positive volume growth  
On trade consumption  which is coffee purchased at chains and fast food outlets  also remains very low  says CLSA  but this hasn t stopped Starbucks from forging new frontiers  This fall  the Seattle based company opened its 500th store on the mainland the company reports a total of 800 stores in Greater China  The strategy appears to be successful so far  The Financial Times indicated that sales in China grew between 30 and 40 percent during the third quarter 
By 2015  Starbucks plans to open 1 500 stores  although this number is low on a per person basis when you consider that in the U S   there are more than 10 000 stores serving lattes and cappuccinos today 
The carbonated beverage market is growing as well  In this area of the beverage market  Coca Cola and PepsiCo together have more than 90 percent market share in China  says CLSA  Over the past 10 years  the firm s data shows the volume of carbonated drinks in China has increased an average of 8 percent per year  but the growth has been slowing in recent years due to rising health awareness and a maturing market 
However  Coca Cola had continued growth over this last quarter  the company reported that worldwide volumes grew by 5 percent  primarily driven by operations in India and China 
This growth may be partially due to the company s rising market share in the fruit and vegetable juice category  In a very fragmented market  over the past 10 years  CLSA shows that Coca Cola has grown from virtually no market share in China s fruit and vegetable juice category  to a 10 percent market share 
In China  fruit and vegetable juices by volume from 2005 through 2010 have experienced strong growth  CLSA says that the market for juices has grown 15 percent per year  driven by a rising health trend  Going forward  volume of fruit and vegetable juices should growth 10 percent per year over the next five years  and 8 percent a year during the 2016 through 2020 timeframe  says CLSA 

In China Fears   A Road Warrior s View  I discussed how American companies are riding the wave of China s growth all the way to the bank  From what they drink and eat to where they shop and what they buy  as increasing incomes provide more discretionary income  the dynamics of the Chinese consumer forever change  I believe savvy investors can benefit from these emerging trends ",2011-11-14,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china's-rising-imports-of-american-goods-105524,105524
177425,398941,PEP,Strong US Employment Data Can t Distract European Fears,opinion,The big news of the afternoon has been the whopping ADP employment number  We all knew the US was getting stronger  but we didn t expect the private sector to create 325k jobs last month  This was 8 standard deviations bigger than the 177k estimate and was the largest monthly gain since December 2010  The gains were mostly in the services sector  construction also increased although financial services saw a decline of 1 000 The report was encouraging since it showed strong gains especially for medium and small companies with less than 50 workers  The market reaction was an immediate spike higher for risk  however  it hasn t managed to have a prolonged effect and EUR USD looks vulnerable as it tests support at 1 2800 The markets won t be convinced about the state of the US labour market until the payrolls figure is released on Friday at 1330GMT  0830 ET  The correlation between ADP and payrolls is virtually nil  so investors are right to temper their jubilation on the back of this number  Added to this some large US companies including Pepsico have announced job cuts in recent days so a strong recovery in the labour market may not be sustained There was another steady decline in the number of people registering to receive jobless benefits as initial jobless claims came in at 372k below the 387k from the week before Christmas  This has pushed the 4 week moving average down to 373 250 from 376 500 the week prior  We doubt that the US labour market is as strong as the ADP number suggests  instead the steady improvement in the jobless claims data is a more accurate representation of  in our view  an economy that is improving slowly  but surely This was also reflected in the ISM non manufacturing survey that was released for December this afternoon  This was stronger than November at 52 6  however it was below expectations of 53 0  The detail of the report was also fairly good with moderate gains for the employment and new orders components  although export orders  backlog of orders and inventory all fell last month The labour market data hasn t been enough to boost the US stock market  which opened lower today  Fears emanating out of Europe continue to dominate the markets and is weighing heavily on the euro  which has been falling continually throughout the London session and is currently below 1 28 for the first time since September 2010  The next support of note through here is 1 2670   the lows from August 2010 The problems in Europe are coming from all directions  Spain  where the economy minister said that banks will need to accumulate EUR 50bn more capital to cover future loan losses  the banking sector  which needs to raise capital but can only do so if it issues new shares at a steep discount  which in turn causes bank share prices to drop even more  and Hungary  The Eastern European nation is fast becoming the Greece of its region after it had a near failed bond auction today and rapidly rising bond yields  But why does this country matter  Because of Austria  of course Austrian banks have exposure to Eastern Europe to the tune of EUR 200bn  mostly through foreign currency mortgages that are getting harder to pay for now that the Forint is falling through the floor  Although the Hungarian government set up a programme to help with foreign currency mortgage burdens  the sovereign finances are also under pressure and the government failed to sell all of the debt it wanted to at an auction today  This makes it more likely that Austrian banks could get hit with rising bad debt levels  possibly requiring state support thus weakening Austria s public finances possibly putting the ECB on the hook for Hungary as well  The Hungarian government is still in talks with the IMF and EU to secure a fresh bailout  the second after it received its first in 2008  however if it can t secure new funds then we could see Hungary default  Hence Austrian 10 year bond yields are much higher today  rising more than 40 basis points in the last 2 days So Hungary is another cog in the massive wheel that is the Eurozone that is dominating market sentiment right now and causing a fresh round of market despair  Interestingly  the Dax rallied on the back of the stronger US data  Since Germany is such a large exporter a strong US is good for German companies  Also  Europe tends to follow the US s economic cycle  albeit with a lag  so a strong US could rub off on Europe s economy later this year The head of the Swiss National Bank Hildebrand is talking  however we expect him to be grilled more on his wife s currency trading than on the EUR CHF peg  The Swissie is fairly stable at the moment  but is at risk of appreciating if he was to resign in light of this crisis since the Swissie would attract safe haven funds  Due to this  EUR CHF could be volatile in the coming hours and days Europe is on everyone s mind and has even nudged the US jobs market out of the limelight  until Friday anyway   There aren t many events in the immediate future that could calm nerves as investors await Italian and Spanish bond auctions next week  so expect a rocky end to the week ,2012-01-05,FOREX.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/strong-us-employment-data-can’t-distract-european-fears-110450,110450
