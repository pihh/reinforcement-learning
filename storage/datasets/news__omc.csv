This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 54   A quarter ago  it was expected that this advertising company would post earnings of  1 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 68  delivering a surprise of 4 35

Omnicom  which belongs to the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry  posted revenues of  3 62 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 37   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 71 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Omnicom shares have added about 2 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 3  
What s Next for Omnicom 
While Omnicom has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Omnicom was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 86 on  4 08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  6 04 on  14 89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

132851,354366,OMC,Republic Services  RSG  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Shares of Republic Services  RSG  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 6 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  95 85 in the previous session  Republic Services has gained 6 8  since the start of the year compared to the 6 3  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 6 5  return for the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 30  2019  Republic Services reported EPS of  0 91 versus consensus estimate of  0 85 
For the current fiscal year  Republic Services is expected to post earnings of  3 49 per share on  10 35 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 8 per share on  10 81 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 5 4  and 4 43   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Republic Services may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Republic Services has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 27 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 6X versus its peer group s average of 12 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 27  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Republic Services currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Republic Services passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Republic Services shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Republic Services Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Republic Services have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Omnicom Group  OMC   NV5 Global  NVEE   and Cardlytics  CDLX   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 28  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Republic Services  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/republic-services-rsg-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200503571,200503571

scenario  which showed its ugly face on Aug 14  has worsened thereafter compelling several economists and financial experts to warn for a possible recession in the U S  economy However  there still exists a ray of hope even under a cloudy financial market landscape  On Aug 27  Paul Hickey  co founder of Bespoke Investment Group  pointed out that yield on long term  30 year U S  Treasury Note has

equities is likely to make equities more attractive alternatives  Intensifying trade conflict with China and fear of a global economic slowdown  especially in Eurozone and China  have significantly dented investors  confidence However  in their rush to pour money to safe haven government bonds from risky equities  market participants have shifted too much money to the bond market resulting in

spread registered its lowest level since 2007 Meanwhile  the yield on short term 3 month Treasury Bill stayed at 1 992   reflecting inversion with the yields of mid term 2 year  benchmark 10 year and

March 2007 The yield curve of government bonds are generally upward sloping  implying that a higher rate of interest is needed for individuals to hold longer maturity bonds  However  an inverted yield curve is generally characterized as market s diminishing expectations about future economic growth  CNBC stated that since 1978  there were five yield inversions between 2 year and 10 year Notes  all of which led to a recession However  several economists and financial experts have pointed out that the fundamentals of the U S  economy are still strong to cope with any recessionary signal  While

132872,354387,OMC,Omnicom  OMC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q3 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Omnicom  OMC  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 68 billion  down 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Omnicom 
For Omnicom  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Omnicom will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Omnicom would post earnings of  1 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 68  delivering a surprise of  4 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Omnicom doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/omnicom-omc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-q3-release-200471529,200471529

132894,354409,OMC,When companies flee U S  tax system  investors often don t reap big returns,news,"By Kevin Drawbaugh  WASHINGTON August 18  Reuters    Establishing a tax domicile abroad to avoid U S  taxes is a hot strategy in corporate America  but many companies that have done such  inversion  deals have failed to produce above average returns for investors  a Reuters analysis has found   Looking back three decades at 52 completed transactions  the review showed 19 of the companies have subsequently outperformed the Standard   Poor s 500 index  while 19 have underperformed  Another 10 have been bought by rivals  three have gone out of business and one has reincorporated back in the United States   Among the poorest performers in the review were oilfield services and engineering firms  all from Texas  Among them was the first of these companies to invert  McDermott International Inc  N MDR   which moved its tax home base to Panama in 1983   Drugmakers are dominating the latest wave of inversions and most of them have outperformed the benchmark index  So far in 2014  five U S  pharmaceutical firms have agreed to redomicile to Ireland  Canada or the Netherlands  Deals that have not been completed were excluded from the review   It is impossible to know how the companies might have fared in the market had they not inverted  Innumerable factors other than taxes influence a stock s performance  and no two of these deals are identical  complicating simple comparisons   But the analysis makes one thing clear  inversions  on their own  despite largely providing the tax savings that companies seek  are no guarantee of superior returns for investors   The deals basically involve a U S  company initially forming or buying a foreign company  Then the U S  company shifts its tax domicile out of the U S  and into the foreign company s home country  The name  inversion  comes from the idea of turning the company upside down  making a smaller offshore unit the new head and the larger U S  business the body   Companies that do these deals typically promise shareholders will benefit  But aside from stock price underperformance by many  inversions can also impose substantial up front tax costs  When a deal occurs  investors must recognize any taxable capital gains on their stockholdings  These costs are not taken into account in the study as they differ for each shareholder and don t apply in some cases    For some companies  these inversions are really smart business moves  For others  they re less smart     You don t always know if it s going to work   said James Hines  professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan and one of a handful of academics who have closely studied these deals   TAXES AND TEXAS  Corporations that invert say they are only seeking to pay the lowest tax rate they can get  noting this is what shareholders would expect them to do   Inversion was pioneered as a strategy by oilfield companies that reincorporated chiefly in the Cayman Islands  Bermuda and Britain  Most have lagged the S P500 since their inversions were completed  McDermott by 85 percent  Rowan Cos Plc  N RDC  by 35 percent  Transocean Ltd  N RIG  by 18 percent  among others   These oilfield stocks also largely underperformed narrower Thomson Reuters and Dow Jones oil and gas equipment and services sector indexes  looking as far back as index data allows   McDermott did not reply to questions sent to the company  Transocean did not respond to requests for comment   A Rowan spokeswoman referred questions to the company web site  It said the company s 2012 UK redomiciling  was designed to enhance shareholder value   while putting Rowan closer to customers and North Sea operations and enabling it to stay competitive  with the effective tax rates of its global competitors  most of which are domiciled outside the U S    Beyond oilfield services  the inversion strategy has been used by a half dozen U S  insurance firms  with half of them outperforming and the rest either acquired or out of business   White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd  N WTM   managed from Hanover  New Hampshire  has outpaced the S P500 by 248 percent since reorganizing in 1999 as a Bermuda corporation  for example  A spokesman for the company said it had no comment   INTENSE COMPETITION  The analysis  using Reuters data and analytics  measured simple share price performance against the S P 500 index using two benchmarks   the date when each company completed its inversion deal  and the date when each deal was announced   With only four exceptions  the inverted companies that were still in business since doing their deals either uniformly underperformed or outperformed on both benchmarks   For instance  U S  engineering and construction group Foster Wheeler AG  O FWLT  announced in November 2000   when its stock was worth about  45 per share   that it was inverting to Bermuda  The deal  a statement said  was  expected to benefit Foster Wheeler and its stockholders for several reasons    Since the announcement  the company s stock has lagged the S P 500 by 50 percent  since the deal was concluded in May 2001  it has trailed the index by 83 percent  Foster Wheeler agreed in January 2014 to be acquired by UK rival Amec Plc  L AMEC  for about  32 69 per share in Amec stock and cash at the time  The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter   Foster Wheeler spokesman Scott Lamb said the company dealt with weak markets  several problematic projects and a major debt restructuring after it inverted to Bermuda  It recovered and so did its stock price  but the 2008 economic downturn  he said  brought  an extended period of moderate demand and intense competitive pressure  These conditions have adversely affected the performance of all of the companies in this sector    Also  in the past decade  he said  the company s revenue and employment base have largely shifted out of North America    HERD MENTALITY   Concern is growing in Washington about inversions  President Barack Obama has criticized a  herd mentality  by companies seeking deals to escape U S  corporate taxes   Of the 52 inversions and similar redomiciling deals done since 1983  22 have occurred since 2008  with 10 more being finalized and many more said to be in the works   Following recent deals by major companies such as Medtronic Inc  N MDT   bankers and analysts have said that another burst of deals is waiting to be unveiled in September   Congressional action this year is unlikely with Republicans so far opposing Democrats  proposals  analysts said  though the Obama administration has been weighing executive actions   For instance  the White House may announce tighter restrictions on federal government contracting with inverted companies  said Chris Krueger  an analyst at Guggenheim Securities in Washington in a research note last week   Inversions have a firm legal basis  The government has been writing rules on them for 30 years  But they are complex and risky and some major proposed deals have recently unraveled   On August 6  for example  after months of internal debate and public criticism from politicians  U S  retailer Walgreen Co  N WAG  said it would not reincorporate in Europe  It was considering using its purchase of Europe s Alliance Boots Holdings  UL ABN  for such a maneuver   Drugmaker Pfizer Inc  N PFE  and advertising firm Omnicom Group Inc  N OMC   U S  leaders in their industries  have also walked away from planned inversions in recent months because they couldn t reach deals with their targets    EARNINGS STRIPPING   No two inversions are identical and they have changed shape along with evolving U S  Internal Revenue Service  IRS  rules   One appeal of inversions is putting foreign profits out of the IRS s reach  Another is  earnings stripping   in which a foreign parent lends to a U S  unit  which deducts the interest to shrink its U S  income for tax purposes  while the foreign parent books the interest at its home country s lower tax rate   Inversion destinations have lower corporate tax rates than the United States  The top U S  rate of 35 percent is among the world s highest  Add state and local taxes and  in much of the United States  the headline corporate rate is even higher   Still  many U S  companies pay far below that headline rate because of abundant loopholes that give businesses  especially big ones  a lower effective tax rate   Inverting usually does not mean a U S  company fully decamps from home  In most cases  it means opening a foreign office  but leaving core operations in the United States    NAKED INVERSIONS   Inversions underwent a major change in 2004 when the IRS adopted a rule   Section 7874 of the tax code   that slapped new limits on the deals  making them harder to do   Pre 7874 deals were sometimes known as  naked  or  self help  inversions  One example was Helen of Troy Ltd  O HELE   an El Paso  Texas consumer products group that sells hair dryers  kitchenware and other goods  In 1994  the company set up a Bermuda holding company and simply transferred its tax domicile into it  Since then  Helen of Troy has outperformed the S P 500 by 219 percent  The company declined to comment   Deals like this continued through 2002  involving groups as diverse as manufacturer Ingersoll Rand Plc  N IR   which has outperformed the S P500 by 103 percent since inverting in 2001  and underwear maker Fruit of the Loom  An Ingersoll Rand spokeswoman declined to comment   Fruit of the Loom inverted to the Cayman Islands in 1998 1999  Three years later  it was bought out of bankruptcy by Berkshire Hathaway   In 2004  Section 7874 was adopted in response to naked inversions  It set two tests for whether an inverted company is recognized as foreign or domestic by the U S  government   EATON AND COOPER  Since Section 7874  most inversions  though not all  have involved the acquisition of actual  operating foreign companies  with the costs  opportunities and challenges that can present   For instance  Cleveland  Ohio s Eaton Corp Plc  N ETN   a maker of power management products  in 2012 moved its tax domicile to low tax Ireland by acquiring Cooper Industries  itself an inverted company that reincorporated from the United States to Bermuda in 2002 and then Dublin in 2009    The acquisition of Cooper was a strategic decision to add scale and breadth to our global electrical business     The acquisition of Cooper was transformational for our business   said Eaton spokesman Scott Schroeder in emailed comments   When the deal was announced  Eaton Chief Executive Sandy Cutler said it would shave about  160 million off Eaton s annual tax bill  He said business motivations  not tax reductions  were the key reasons for the transaction   Eaton s effective tax rate in 2013 was only 0 6 percent  down from 2 5 percent in 2012 and from 12 9 percent in 2011  said Eaton s 2013 annual report to federal regulators    The lower effective tax rate for 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily attributable to the effects associated with the acquisition of Cooper  along with greater levels of income in lower tax jurisdictions and additional foreign tax credit utilization   Eaton said in the Securities and Exchange Commission filing   Despite the tax savings  Eaton has underperformed the S P 500 by 5 percent since completing the Cooper deal in November 2012  But  measuring from the day when the deal was announced in May 2012  Eaton s share price has outperformed the index by 9 percent  Reuters data showed   The first U S  drug company in the 52 to complete an inversion was biotechnology group Xoma Corp  O XOMA   which shifted to Bermuda in 1998  Thirteen years later  the company returned its tax domicile to the United States  saying in a statement it wanted to reduce exposure to possibly adverse tax legislation and to come back to a more familiar legal system   
Xoma has posted losses since 2010 and  despite returning to California  has underperformed the S P500 by 95 percent since it went to Bermuda  A spokeswoman said Xoma had no comment     Editing by Amy Stevens and Martin Howell ",2014-08-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/when-companies-flee-u.s.-tax-system,-investors-often-don't-reap-big-returns-303893",303893

What s Next for Omnicom 
While Omnicom has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

132915,354430,OMC,Omnicom  Publicis Call Off  35B Merger,news,"By    U S  based Omnicom Group Inc   NYSE OMC  and French rival Publicis Groupe SA  PARIS PUBP  have called off their  35 billion merger  noting  difficulties in completing the transaction within a reasonable time frame   the Wall Street Journal reported  The megamerger have formed the world s biggest advertising agency 
The deal  presented in July  started unraveling after Omnicom chief executive John Wren revealed doubts about it    noting tax complications    at an earnings call last month  according to Reuters 
 The challenges that still remained to be overcome  in addition to the slow pace of progress  created a level of uncertainty detrimental to the interests of both groups and their employees  clients and shareholders   Wren and Publicis CEO Maurice Levy said in a joint statement Thursday   We have thus jointly decided to proceed along our independent paths  We  of course  remain competitors  but maintain a great respect for one another  
The deal was abandoned due to several sticking points  including the companies  failure to agree on a chief financial officer who would have taken charge of implementing the deal  a source close to Publicis told Reuters  Neither company will pay a termination fee     
Another source familiar said cultural differences between the two firms proved to be too tough to hurdle as tension regarding leadership and strategy increased  Reuters reported  A third source said the boards of the two companies met Thursday to unwind the deal  The three sources  one of whom said that  big egos  were involved  requested anonymity because they re not authorized to discuss the matter publicly  the news agency added 
According to the Journal  the deal  which was described as a  merger of equals   had been challenged by battles over position and power  including difficulties in getting tax and other regulatory approvals  people familiar with the matter said 
The merger  announced with plenty of fanfare  was made to bring each firm extra strength in competing with the likes of juggernauts such as Google Inc  and Facebook  which dominate digital advertising  and that accounts for almost a quarter of global marketing spending  Reuters said 
The deal would have led to the world s biggest ad holding company by revenue as it combined ad agencies such as BBDO  DDB  Saatchi   Saatchi  TBWA and Leo Burnett  public relations firms like FleishmanHillard and Ketchum and digital ad agencies including DigitasLBi and Razorfish  the Journal said 
The merger called for a 50 50 ownership split of the equity in the new company  Publicis Omnicom Group  with Wren and Levy operating as co CEOs for 30 months from the closing  according to Reuters 
The crucial choice of chief financial officer had been a particular sticking point  Reuters noted  
According to a person familiar with the situation  differences over the position were so stark that last November  Omnicom executives told an analyst in the U S  that its CFO  Randy Weisenburger  would get the job  but Publicis executives told another analyst that its CFO  Jean Michel Etienne  would get it the position  the Journal reported 
 We both have strong personalities and we both have strong corporate cultures but there was no one factor   Wren said ",2014-05-08,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/omnicom,-publicis-call-off-$35b-merger-283211",283211

132917,354432,OMC,Walgreen retreats from plan to move tax domicile abroad ,news,"By Kevin Drawbaugh and Olivia Oran  WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  retailer Walgreen Co  N WAG  has backed away from a plan to reincorporate abroad to cut its U S  tax bill  while the Obama administration said it was considering steps to curb such corporate tax domicile shifting deals   Walgreen  the operator of the largest U S  pharmacy chain  will buy the 55 percent it does not already own of European rival Alliance Boots  UL ABN   but the U S  company will not use the deal to move its tax domicile overseas  said a person familiar with the matter   Walgreen issued a statement late on Tuesday saying it would announce  several updates  on Alliance Boots at 6 a m  Eastern time  1000 GMT  on Wednesday  followed by a conference call with management at 8 a m  ET  The company said the updates would cover  the transaction s timing and structure    Walgreen s retreat will be the third major possible  inversion  deal involving a major company to collapse in recent months amid controversy  underscoring the complexity and heightened political sensitivity in the United States of these transactions   Walgreen had been under pressure from investors to do such a deal as part of its buyout of Alliance Boots so the U S  retailer s tax domicile could be moved to Switzerland or Britain   But the company also faced criticism from Democratic politicians  including the senior U S  senator from its home state  Richard Durbin    I believe you will find that your customers are deeply patriotic and will not support Walgreen s decision to turn its back on the United States   Durbin wrote to Walgreen CEO Gregory Wasson last month   Nearly all of your  2 5 billion in profits earned last year were from sales to U S  taxpaying customers    In an inversion  a U S  corporation buys or sets up a foreign company and then moves its tax domicile to that foreign company and its home country  while leaving core business operations in the United States  Doing such a deal ends U S  taxation of the company s foreign profits and makes it easier for the company to take other tax cutting steps   Walgreen shares ended regular trading on Tuesday at  69 12  down 4 4 percent    Given Walgreen s physical retail presence in the U S  we believe Walgreen is somewhat unique relative to recent pharma manufacturer tax inversion deals  Walgreen ability to trim its tax bill may be less substantial relative to other industry tax inversions   wrote Leerink Partners analysts in a note    We believe long term fundamentals are sound and management will likely also provide updated fiscal 2016 guidance     which could help offset potential investor disappointment if a tax inversion is abandoned   they added   A spokeswoman for Alliance Boots declined to comment   TREASURY WEIGHS OPTIONS  Separately  the Obama administration said on Tuesday it was considering administrative actions to discourage inversions  given the failure of Congress to address the issue    Treasury is reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative actions that could limit the ability of companies to engage in inversions  as well as approaches that could meaningfully reduce the tax benefits after inversions take place   a Treasury Department spokesperson said in an email   The spokesperson added there were limits to what Treasury could do without action by Congress  and that  legislation is the only way to fully address inversions    Three prominent Democratic senators on Tuesday urged President Barack Obama to use his executive authority to reduce or eliminate tax breaks for companies that invert   Nine inversion deals have been agreed to this year by U S  companies ranging from banana distributor Chiquita Brands International Inc  N CQB  to drugmaker AbbVie Inc  N ABBV  and more are being considered  The transactions are occurring at a record pace since the first inversion three decades ago   But two large inversions recently collapsed  one involved U S  drugmaker Pfizer Inc  N PFE   and the other  U S  advertising company Omnicom Group Inc  N OMC   Both had targeted European rivals for acquisition  with a tax domicile move abroad included in their plans  but the deals unraveled   SENATORS URGE ACTION  Senator Durbin  the second ranking Senate Democrat  along with Senators Jack Reed and Elizabeth Warren  said immediate action was needed to stem these transactions  citing concerns about fairness and the eroding U S  corporate tax base   Durbin  who is personally close to Obama  is from Illinois and had publicly urged Walgreen not to go through with an inversion  Obama himself formerly was a senator for Illinois   In his letter to Walgreen last month  Durbin closed with a jab at the firm s advertising tagline  Durbin asked   Is  the corner of happy and healthy  somewhere in the Swiss Alps    Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has publicly questioned the patriotism of companies that do inversions   We are looking at a very long list of possible ways to address the issue   he said in an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday   Alliance Boots has itself come under attack in Britain for cutting its taxes through its Swiss domicile  with trade union Unite noting it has lowered its UK tax bill by over 1 billion pounds since 2007 although about 40 percent of its total revenues come from British taxpayers   Inversions are still rare but are becoming more common  Of the roughly 50 inversion deals done since 1983  about 40 percent have been completed since 2009 and more are being finalized  with many others said to be in the planning stages   
Inversion deals are legal  and company executives who arrange them say they are only trying to minimize the amount of taxes the company pays  as investors expect them to do   UK based Sky News was first to report that Walgreen had decided not to proceed with its planned reincorporation     Additional reporting by Esha Vaish and Ramkumar Iyer in Bangalore  Greg Roumeliotis in New York  David Lawder  Mark Felsenthal and Jason lange in Washington and Emma Thomasson in Berlin  Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Mark Potter ",2014-08-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/walgreen-retreats-from-plan-to-move-tax-domicile-abroad:-report-301174,301174
132918,354433,OMC,Walgreen to keep U S  tax domicile after buying Alliance Boots,news,"By Emma Thomasson and Sruthi Ramakrishnan   Reuters    U S  retailer Walgreen Co  N WAG  said it would not use a full takeover of Europe s biggest pharmacy chain  Alliance Boots  ABN UL   to move its domicile overseas  following fierce criticism of such tax cutting deals at home   Walgreen will buy the 55 percent it does not already own of Alliance Boots for 3 13 billion pounds   5 3 billion  in cash and 144 3 million shares  giving a total deal of about  15 billion   Walgreen shares fell as much as 16 percent to  58 30 on Wednesday   The U S  group said the combined company  with more than 11 000 stores in 10 countries  would keep its tax domicile in the United States  with headquarters in the Chicago area  It is targeting combined revenue for 2016 of  126 130 billion   Walgreen s retreat is the third major possible tax  inversion  deal to collapse in recent months amid heightened political sensitivity in the United States to such transactions   President Barack Obama told reporters on Wednesday that his administration plans to move quickly on measures to discourage the use of inversions    We don t want to see this trend grow   Obama said at a news conference  not specifically mentioning Walgreen  which is based in his home state of Illinois    That kind of herd mentality is something we want to avoid  so we want to move quickly  as quickly as possible   Obama said   Walgreen had been under pressure from investors to shift its tax domicile to Switzerland or Britain as part of the buyout   The pharmacy chain said it was mindful of the public reaction to a potential inversion deal and its role as an  iconic American consumer retail company with a major portion of its revenues derived from government funded reimbursement programs     The company concluded it was not in the best long term interest of our shareholders to attempt to re domicile outside the U S    CEO Greg Wasson said in a statement   He said the company could not find a structure it was sure could withstand extensive scrutiny from U S  tax authorities   Wasson will be chief executive of the combined company  to be named Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  Alliance Boots Executive Chairman Stefano Pessina will be its executive vice chairman  responsible for strategy and M A for the combined company    Pessina will be integral to solidifying the combined company s position as the big beast in the global drugstore space   said Kelly Tackett  U S  director of research at retail analytics firm Planet Retail    We fully expect more acquisitions to follow  with shoring up its presence in Latin America likely to be first on the agenda   Tackett said   Following Walgreen s acquisition of 45 percent of Alliance Boots in 2012  Pessina gained an about 8 percent stake in the U S  company  making him the largest shareholder   He is expected to remain the largest shareholder in the combined company after the deal closes in 2015  an Alliance Boots spokeswoman said on Wednesday   After news leaked on Tuesday that Walgreen would not do an inversion deal  shares in the company fell 4 4 percent in regular trading to close at  69 12  Goldman Sachs and Lazard are advising Walgreen on the transaction   In an inversion  a U S  corporation buys or sets up a foreign company and then moves its tax domicile to that foreign company and its home country  while leaving core business operations in the United States   Doing such a deal ends U S  taxation of the company s foreign profits and makes it easier for the company to take other tax cutting steps   PATRIOTIC CUSTOMERS  Senator Richard Durbin  the senior U S  senator from Walgreen s home state who is personally close to Obama  had publicly urged the company not to go through with an inversion   Walgreen announced a new forecast for adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of  4 25  4 60 for the fiscal year ending August 2016  taking into account lower pharmacy reimbursements and a rapid rise in drug prices   The company also said it expects to achieve  1 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017  including corporate  field and store level cuts  It said it planned a new  3 billion share repurchase program   Walgreen expects to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2015  it said   A consortium led by billionaire Pessina and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co  L P   KKR  took Alliance Boots  which runs the Boots chain of pharmacies that dot main streets across Britain  private in 2007   Alliance Boots has itself come under attack in the UK for schemes to cut its tax bill  with a charity and a labor union accusing the firm last year of avoiding over 1 1 billion pounds   1 9 billion  in UK tax since 2008   Alliance Boots responded by saying it conducts its business and organises its tax affairs strictly in compliance with all applicable law and observes the highest standard of good ethics

132932,354447,OMC,Omnicom  OMC  To Report Q2 Results  What To Know Ahead Of The Release,opinion,"The market expects Omnicom  OMC  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  3 71 billion  down 3 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Omnicom 
For Omnicom  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Omnicom will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Omnicom would post earnings of  1 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 17  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

132981,354496,OMC,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Republic Services  RSG  Now,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions 
One such stock is Republic Services  Inc    NYSE RSG    which has gained 14 6  in the past year  outperforming the 11 6  gain of the  it belongs to and 1 7  rise of the Zacks S P 500 composite 

 
It has an expected long term  three to five years  earnings per share growth rate of 8 8   Moreover  earnings are expected to register 5 2  growth in 2019 and 10 5  in 2020  
However  the company faces its share of headwinds  Republic Services continues to face weak landfill pricing due to high cost of landfills and leachate  High debt may limit the company s future expansion and worsen its risk profile  Price increase and profitability expansion becomes difficult while operating in a highly competitive solid waste industry  Despite these headwinds  we believe that the company has enough positives that justify retention in investors  portfolio 
Factors Driving Republic Services

133051,354566,OMC,Stocks Take It Slow To Start The Week ,opinion,"It s looking like  one of those weeks  for the market  as we wait for trade news out of China and prepare for the next round of earnings reports  Plus  we ll be watching to see if Washington shuts down the government for the second time this year  and its only February 
	With so much uncertainty in the air  it makes sense that the major indices would only be able to breakeven on Monday  The NASDAQ improved 0 13  to 7307 9  while the S P advanced 0 07  to 2709 8 
	The Dow started higher by nearly 100 points  but ultimately dropped into the red for most of the day and finished lower by 0 21   or about 53 points  to 25 053 11  The indices all slipped into the red at one point  but another late advance lifted them off the lows 
	According to reports  the U S  and China are in talks to get Presidents Trump and Xi together at a summit sometime next month  possibly at Mar a Lago in Florida  Last week  the market was very disappointed to hear that the two leaders would definitely not be meeting before the trade deadline on March 1 when tariffs are expected to be raised 
	Nevertheless  scheduling such a meeting would be a big positive  since there isn t likely to be a real trade deal until the two bigwigs meet in person  Perhaps Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer can lay the groundwork with their Chinese counterparts that will lead to a true success when the big meeting happens sometime next month  Fingers crossed   
	Meanwhile  the Dow and NASDAQ will be going for an 8th straight week in the green  The S P will be trying for a third straight  though its only fallen short one week since the market got its act together on Dec 26  Last week  stocks barely kept their winning streak alive as the last several sessions came under pressure due to trade concerns

133077,354592,OMC,Omnicom  OMC  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Omnicom  OMC   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Omnicom currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if OMC is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this advertising company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For OMC  shares are up 0 53  over the past week while the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 82  compares favorably with the industry s 7 05  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Omnicom have risen 2 42   and are up 2 22  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 2  and  2 48   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to OMC s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  OMC is currently averaging 1 667 960 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with OMC 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost OMC s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 63 to  5 65 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that OMC is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Omnicom on your short list ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/omnicom-omc-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200382723,200382723
