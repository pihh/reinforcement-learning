205448,426964,KHC,Is It Safe to Buy Kraft Heinz Stock Yet ,news,"Few big brand stocks have endured the kind of setback that Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  has in recent years 
The company that resulted from the merger of its two eponymous food giants has slashed its dividend by 36   restated close to three years of earnings on the heels of an accounting scandal  and written down  15 4 billion in assets    including part of the brand value of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer names 
Shares of the food giant are down more than two thirds from their peak in 2017  showing how disappointing the company s performance has been  
Despite that unfortunate track record  there are reasons that the stock could be appealing today  Kraft Heinz is backed by some of the most respected firms in the investing world  including Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital   it pays a dividend yielding 5 3   and it owns a trove of globally known brands as well as the distribution to go with it 
Finally  Kraft Heinz is also being guided by a new CEO  Miguel Patricio  who took over last July following the debacle last year that shaved nearly a third off the stock in one day 

Less is more
In a recent Wall Street Journal report  Patricio explained that simplifying Kraft Heinz was a key part of his strategy for turning around the business  He said he was aiming for  fewer  bigger bets  
Kraft plans to discontinue some poor performing product lines  and though Patricio didn t specifically address it  selling some of its brands may be a wise move  That would help shore up its balance sheet since the company has more than  30 billion in debt  and divestitures would help it focus on brands that give it the greatest potential for growth  One of the problems Kraft Heinz has  as Patricio sees it  is that it operates in 56 different product categories  making across the board innovation difficult  if not impossible  Selling off product lines and simplifying the business may be the best answer  Procter   Gamble  the household products giant  employed a similar strategy in recent years  and its stock has surged as the company has gotten back to organic growth and an efficient operating structure 
Kraft Heinz remains highly profitable  and Patricio indicated that the company would be willing to sacrifice profit for growth  
Plenty of challenges
Though Kraft Heinz and Procter   Gamble have a number of similarities  including a long history and broad portfolio of age old  global brands  Kraft Heinz competes in a more difficult sector than P G 
Today  many legacy food brands are struggling  including General Mills  Kellogg s  and Campbell s Soup  as changing consumer habits favoring organic brands and fresh foods have made it difficult to grow sales  For Kraft Heinz  many of its brands  like Jell O  Velveeta  and Maxwell House  seem hopelessly dated 
The company s balance sheet also looks weak  with about  30 billion in debt  a current ratio barely above 1  which could cause a liquidity crunch down the road   and  85 billion in intangible assets that could be at risk of a writedown following the  15 4 billion impairment a year ago  It also spent more on dividends than it generated in free cash flow for the first three quarters  giving it a payout ratio of 104  and putting it at risk for another dividend cut 
Meanwhile  profits are falling quickly  Through the first three quarters of 2019  profits fell in all of its regions  and adjusted earnings per share dropped 20  in that period to  2 13  It s lost nearly  1 billion in adjusted EBITDA during that period as well  with organic sales down 1 6   And analysts expect profits to continue to slip in 2020 
All that adds up to a daunting set of challenges for Kraft Heinz  A bold plan and some asset sales could spark a recovery in the stock  but the macro challenges in processed foods combined with a bloated balance sheet  shrinking profits  and an uninspiring track record make Kraft Heinz a stock best left alone for now  Though it may look a value play for now at a P E of 10 2  it could have more room to fall as the number of negative catalysts outweigh the positive for now  For income investors and others  it s simply not worth the risk ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pn-hj,2069663

205470,426986,KHC,Kraft Heinz sees potential in baby food  will keep Plasmon,news,"MILAN  Reuters    Global packaged food group Kraft Heinz Co  O KHC  will keep baby food line Plasmon and plans to leverage its  Made in Italy  credentials to expand the brand abroad  Kraft Heinz Co s general manager for Italy said 
Earlier this year  the maker of Heinz ketchup explored the possibility of selling Italy based Plasmon and other labels  as it grappled with write downs for some of its brands and an investigation into its accounting policies 
A review has brought a change in strategy for Kraft Heinz Italia s  210 million revenue baby food business  which comprises Plasmon and smaller labels Nipiol  Cuore di Natura and Dieterba 
 The review has shown that Plasmon and the whole baby food business have growth potential to be exploited   Kraft Heinz General Manager for Italy Felipe Della Negra told Reuters 
The world s baby food sector is estimated to be worth  63 billion this year and is expected to grow annually by 5  between 2019 and 2023  according to market research company Statista 
The 117 year old Plasmon sells a range of products including first milk  homogenized baby food  pasta and fruit compote for babies 
It is best known for its infant biscuits made with powdered milk  vitamins and minerals 
 We want to export more  banking on the fact that we are an Italian food company and we can guarantee a full disclosure over the ingredients of our baby food products   Della Negra said in a phone interview 
He added the group was implementing a project to increase the use of Italian ingredients for Plasmon products under a deal signed with Italy s agriculture ministry in May

205485,427001,KHC,Bonds Suggest a Ceiling for the Stock Market,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Corporate credit markets have bad news for stock investors  Low yields imply that it s going to be tough for stocks to rally much further from here 
Since equities made what was then an all time high in January 2018  performance of the stock market has largely tracked the movement of investment grade corporate bond yields  The rise in yields in 2018 acted as a headwind for stocks  with the S P 500 posting its worst year since 2008  So far this year  the opposite has occurred  with Treasury yields plunging in response to a changed outlook from the Federal Reserve  Stocks have surged as that interest rate pressure has abated  with  low volatility  stocks like consumer staples and utilities doing particularly well  Their performance tends to be tied to interest rates 
The last couple of times corporate yields got this low preceded periods of stock market stagnation  One occurrence was in early February 2015  with yields falling in sympathy with the decline in oil prices  Equities finished the year essentially unchanged  Another instance was in July 2016  shortly after the Brexit vote  Equities drifted lower for the next four months  until just before the U S  presidential election 
A big factor underlying this thesis is about the prospects for earnings growth  From the fourth quarter of 2014 through the second quarter of 2016   a period more or less coinciding with the last couple of occurrences of low corporate yields   S P 500 earnings growth was negative  And over the long run  equities tend to outperform corporate bonds because earnings have tended to grow over time  Without earnings growth  investors would probably prefer the security of bonds to the risk of stocks 
And the problem for today is that earnings growth  after a robust two and a half years  has slowed down significantly  S P 500 earnings growth was in the low single digits in both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019  While earnings growth is projected to pick up significantly in the second half of the year  that seems at odds with broader concerns of slowing global growth and a need for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates 
If earnings growth does pick up significantly in the second half of the year  then stock performance probably won t be affected by corporate bond yields  But there are plenty of reasons to suspect growth will not pick up  Any slowdown in GDP growth or ratcheting up of the trade war will probably be felt in corporate America s bottom line  Wage growth for employees  now in the low to mid 3  range  is about one full percentage point higher than it s been for most of this expansion  which should act as a headwind for profits  It s unclear how much corporations will be willing to take on additional debt to fund earnings growth via stock buybacks or M A given some concerns about corporate leverage  Companies like Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  have gotten bitten by taking on too much debt 
The kind of earnings growth we ve gotten over the past few years was either one off in nature or more difficult to repeat going forward  There was a cyclical upturn in global economic activity that ran from early 2016 through the middle of 2018 that fueled earnings growth  Passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in early 2018  which lowered corporate tax rates and allowed corporations to repatriate cash from overseas  was a one off boost for profitability  With those two catalysts behind us  earnings growth may be modest at best  tracking overall economic growth  perhaps with workers getting a bigger share of the pie as the labor market continues to tighten 
And if earnings growth remains modest  stocks may struggle to do more than track the performance of corporate bonds  With yields near their lows of the cycle  that doesn t leave much juice for investors to squeeze ",2019-07-09,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bonds-suggest-a-ceiling-for-the-stock-market-1918279,1918279

205529,427045,KHC,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Kraft  KHC ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC   which belongs to the Zacks Food   Miscellaneous industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of Oscar Mayer meats  Jell O pudding and Velveeta cheese has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 17 09  
For the most recent quarter  Kraft was expected to post earnings of  0 53 per share  but it reported  0 69 per share instead  representing a surprise of 30 19   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 75 per share  while it actually produced  0 78 per share  a surprise of 4  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Kraft  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Kraft currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 33   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 13  2020 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-kraft-khc-200503325,200503325

205546,427062,KHC,Cultural mix a hidden weapon in Nestle CEO s activist defense,news,"By Martinne Geller LONDON  Reuters    Growing up in Germany  Mark Schneider was pushed to become fluent in English by his father  who believed it would give him an edge  Now as Nestle s  S NESN  relatively new chief executive  the 52 year old s abilities are being put to the test by an activist U S  investor pressing him to act faster and more forcefully to raise the Swiss company s profit  Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb s Third Point is urging steps it says can boost margins and double earnings per share at the world s biggest food company by 2022   Years spent in the United States landed Schneider dual German U S  citizenship and a Harvard MBA  Combined with a PhD from the Swiss university of St  Gallen and 13 years as CEO of a German firm  he has the experience to balance the measured European shareholder approach and American style activism  analysts say   Schneider can hopefully bring both of those things to his role   Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said  adding that if he fails to deliver on his strategy  the maker of Gerber baby food and Nescafe could face calls for a break up  Third Point sent a letter to the board and published a 34 page presentation on recommendations for Nestle this week but has not given a deadline for the changes  which include selling its L Oreal  PA OREP  stake and reorganizing into three business units  Sources familiar with the matter say the fund had several interactions with Nestle in the past year since becoming a top 10 shareholder  The next meeting  set for autumn  had already been scheduled prior to this week s action  one source said  As the first outsider to become Nestle CEO in almost a century  Schneider has impressed investors with his candid assessment of the company s problems and lightened the mood at its Lake Geneva headquarters  often seen wearing open necked shirts and eating in the staff cafeteria  MARGIN IN FOCUS  Schneider s track record is strong  At the helm of German healthcare company Fresenius  DE FREG   he oversaw merger and acquisition  M A  deals that brought a twelvefold increase in net income  But industry wide troubles like changing consumer habits  economic uncertainty and upstart rivals have taken their toll on Nestle  and analysts say its spotty M A record  sprawling structure and occasional arrogance have not helped   Some people think the external pressure from Third Point  which owns about 1 percent of Nestle s shares  may actually help Schneider as he tries to shake up the Swiss company s corporate culture  as well as improve sales and earnings growth   Every investor in Nestle wants them to get the margins up a bit faster   said Ali Miremadi  a fund manager at GAM Investment Management  which owns nearly  73 million of Nestle shares  Reuters data shows   That s also what the chief executive and the board want    Schneider has begun with frequent  incremental changes  while avoiding a big bang such as selling Nestle s 23 percent stake in L Oreal  which Third Point and others advocate  In 18 months  he has made nine acquisitions and 11

205547,427063,KHC,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Another Strong Jobs Report Expected
Trading direction at the start of trading Friday will be dictated by the July employment numbers  But given the recent economic data and assessment from the Federal Reserve  big market swings are unlikely 
The Labor Department will issue the report at 8 30 AM ET  12 30 GMT  
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 193 000 last month and that the unemployment rate ticked down to 3 9  
The employment data out so far this week has been positive  Private sector employment rose more than expected  according to ADP  and initial jobless claims rose  but less than forecast 
Wage growth could be the most interesting part of the report  It s been pretty tame despite the large job gains 
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0 3  month on month  up from a 0 2  rise in June  Compared with a year ago period  wage growth is seen steady at 2 7  
A spike could put the Federal Reserve on notice about inflation as it considers more rate hikes  The Fed said this week it would continue to gradually raise rates should the economy continue to show  sustained expansion   supported by a strong labor market and close to target inflation 
Inflation  measured by the personal consumption expenditures  PCE  price index  should be at 2  this year and tick up to 2 2  in 2019  according to a  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  note released this week 
2  Kraft  Groupon Will Report
While the bulk of companies have reported earnings  investors will likely look to a few names expected to release quarterly reports ahead of trading Friday 
Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  is expected to report a quarterly profit of 92 cents per share on sales of about  6 6 billion 
The top line will likely get the most scrutiny as the company has seen softness in sales in recent quarter  Investors will also be looking for signs of cost inflation 
In addition  online coupon company Groupon  NASDAQ GRPN  will issue results  Analysts expect it to post a profit of 3 cents per share on sales of  632 million  Shares of Groupon are higher in the past three months 
Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  reports after the bell tomorrow  But the actual results will be overshadowed if the company decides to announce a stock repurchase plan  Berkshire loosened its stock buyback rules in July  but said it would not make a move until after its earnings were released 
3  Slight Drop in Services Activity Forecast
While the jobs report will grab the headlines  there is more economic data to consider 
The ISM non manufacturing purchasing manager s index  PMI  arrives at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT   Economists predict a measure of 58 6 in July services activity  down from 59 1 
In addition  Markit s measures of July manufacturing and services economic activity come in at 9 45 AM ET  13 45 GMT  
The Markit composite PMI is seen coming in at 55 9 and the services PMI is forecast at 56 2  That would reflect an unchanged reading for both from the month before ",2018-08-02,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1558281,1558281

205567,427083,KHC,Earnings Preview  Kraft Heinz  KHC  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Oscar Mayer meats  Jell O pudding and Velveeta cheese is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  31 5  
Revenues are expected to be  6 07 billion  down 3 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5 48  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kraft 
For Kraft  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 78  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kraft will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kraft would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering a surprise of  9 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kraft doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-kraft-heinz-khc-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200410263,200410263
205568,427084,KHC,Kraft Heinz Restates Financial Results For Past 3 Years  How Investors Are Responding,opinion,"Misstated Financial Results
Kraft Heinz   NASDAQ KHC   is restating its financial results for the past 3 years  following an SEC investigation  Kraft Heinz representative said   the findings from the investigation did not identify any misconduct by any member of the senior management team   Their procurement department has been under investigation for the past 3 months to determine if accounting procedures used in this segment were in line with SEC guidelines 
The company restated 2016  2017 and 2018 EPS with an estimated misstatement being  0 3     1 7    and  0 8   respectively  These restated financials give investors a little more confidence in the stock because they can now quantify the impact  KHC is up about 0 6  in trading today while the broader markets are experiencing a decline on renewed trade concerns
Performance
Over the past 3 months  KHC has been through the wringer losing 30  of its value after its most recent earnings release in February  The company reported a massive loss in Q4 which was primarily driven by significant write downs on major assets including the brands themselves  like Kraft and Oscar Mayer  KHC also substantially cut their dividends which is a sign of concern for any public company  leading investors to conclude the company will not be able to generate enough profits to payout to investors sustainably The Kraft Heinz Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   There was also a lot of concern around the investigation into Kraft Heinz s bookkeeping  leaving investors unsure of potential legal liabilities that the company could accrue  These misstated financial results illustrate a lack of internal controls in the firm  The preliminary financial restatement released today was a solid step in the right direction and putting investors  minds at ease slightly 
The Merger and The PE Mentality 
Kraft Heinz was created through a merger in March of 2015 between Kraft Foods and H J  Heinz which was owned by 3G Capital  a Brazilian private equity fund  and Berkshire Hathaway   Warren Buffett s investment holding company  This newly created firm  Kraft Heinz  became the 5th largest consumer packaged goods company in the world by revenue  The assumption was that the combination of these two CPG powerhouses would help them achieve larger economies to scale and leverage distribution and facility synergies 
Kraft Heinz selected Bernardo Hees  a partner at 3G Capital  to be this new firm s leader and CEO in 2015  Bernardo Hees thinks like any private equity investor  making efficiencies within the company in order to cut costs and drive the bottom line for short run profits to boost the stock until they divest their position  3G Capital s average holding period for any position is 3 5 years which is typical for a PE firm  This burn   churn mentality is how PE firms are able to achieve strong returns for their investors  Unfortunately for 3G Capital they didn t divest quickly enough from this venture to be profitable and are now attempting to pivot their strategy to salvage the investment 
Bernardo Hees stepped down at the end of April for obvious performance reasons and is being replaced by Miguel Patricio who was the Chief Marketing Officer  CMO  at Anheuser Busch InBev between 2012 and 2016  This is a move made by 3G Capital who has a 27  stake in Anheuser Busch  An analyst at Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Robert Moskow  saw this as a positive shift saying   we think this change at the helm is a good sign for investors because it demonstrates that the company is very serious about pivoting its priorities toward growth rather than just cost cutting  
It is unfortunate to see a company like Kraft Heinz get run into the ground  overheating cost cutting and expanding margins to a fault  This private equity mentality is what caused KHC to lose over 60  of its value over the last 2 years 
Fundamentals Point to an Oversold KHC
KHC is trading at an 11 43x forward P E far below the industries average of 17 1x and down more than 50  from KHC s 25x forward P E in Q1 2017  KHC is sitting at a price to cash flow of 3 43x nearly   the CPG industries 12 48x  I believe that the new CEO Miguel Patricio  who has experience expanding a fortune 500 firm s market  will have a positive impact on this dying CPG firm 
Consumer Packaged Goods  CPG  firms are a declining category in the world today  Millennials are now the largest consuming generation  ages 23 38  and they have a renewed focus on  healthy living  which doesn t include over processed CPG products  I do not have a good feeling about Kraft Heinz in the long run  but I believe that the company is currently oversold and traders could see a nice return once Kraft Heinz regains its bearings 
If management is willing to sacrifice short term margins to invest in its brands for future sustainable growth than this company may still have a fighting chance to gain market share and expand operations  KHC   Zacks Rank  3  Hold

205582,427098,KHC,Should We Buy Kraft Heinz At The Current Price  ,opinion,"Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC  stock is down 30  in the past month  The company is available at an attractive forward P E ratio of 11 03  Let us analyze the factors that led to the sell off 
The company released its fourth quarter 2018 and full year results on February 21  2019  Revenue for the 4Q 2018 increased 0 7  year on year to  6 9 billion and full year  it was flat at  26 3 billion  4Q adjusted earnings per share came at  0 84 compared to  0 90 for the same period last year 
4Q revenue missed analyst s estimates by  50 million and EPS missed estimates by 10 cents  There are various red flags which got investors worried  The company had reported a goodwill impairment losses of  7 1 billion and intangible asset impairment losses of  8 3 billion in the fourth quarter  On account of these one time charges  net income came at   12 6 billion when compared to a profit of  8 0 billion for the same period last year 
The company disclosed a SEC investigation into its accounting policies  It also decided to trim its dividend by 36 percent to 40 cents per share each quarter in order to strengthen its balance sheet 
Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  analyst Rob Dickerson cut Kraft to hold from Buy   However  our visibility with respect to the depth  duration  and general pro tability e ects of such customer  and consumer building into 2019 is less clear and lowers our conviction on the name   analyst Rob Dickerson said in a research note 
NYU Finance Professor Aswath Damodaran feels that the stock is currently fairly valued   The good news is that  even with a stilted story  Kraft Heinz has a value   34 88  that is close to the stock price   34 23   The bad news is that the potential upside looks limited  as you can see in the results of a simulation that I did  allowing expected revenue growth  operating margin and cost of capital to be drawn from distributions  rather than using point estimates  
Since the merger of Kraft and Heinz in 2015 the companies have done well to reduce costs  However  packaged foods are losing sheen among consumers to fresh foods and lower priced private label products  The cost cutting efforts of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  and 3G Capital in the case of Kraft Heinz did not go well 
Investors had a great hope on the company due to the strong brands and also the company is backed by Warren Buffet s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil s private equity firm 3G Capital  Investors who had hoped to have good dividend are also left disappointed after the company decided to cut dividends 
The company s plan going forward is to sustain commercial momentum  more actively manage the portfolio  and strengthen the balance sheet  The company expects growth to improve 2020 onwards  However  investors would be more careful going forward 
Conclusion  The stock is looking attractive after the recent stock sell off  The company has great brands  However  investors need to remember that the company s organic growth is slowing and the operating profits will come down due to higher expenses  The company might also avoid acquisitions going forward after the Kraft Heinz debacle

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Kraft due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Kraft Heinz Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates  Guides WeakKraft Heinz reported fourth quarter 2018 results  Adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents came below the consensus mark of 93 cents  Also  the bottom line decreased 6 7  year over year  as gains from lower taxes were more than offset by lower adjusted EBITDA  elevated interest costs  and greater depreciation and amortization costs Net sales came in at  6 891 million  depicting 0 7  rise from  6 844 million reported in the prior year quarter  Net sales growth includes 0 5 percentage point gain from buyouts and divestitures as well as a negative impact of 2 2 percentage points from currency  Organic sales increased 2 4  Pricing depicted a decline of 1 6 percentage points  owing to increased promotional support and pricing actions in North America  negated by higher pricing in EMEA and ROW regions  Volume mix increased 4 0 percentage points due to solid consumption gains in North America  and growth in condiments and sauces in Latin America  EMEA and North America Gross profit of  2 233 million declined almost 3  year over year Adjusted EBITDA was down 13 9  to  1 699 million in the quarter  with currency playing a spoilsport to the tune of nearly 2 4 percentage points  Excluding currency  softness in adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by weakness in the United States  which countered growth in all other regions Segment DiscussionUnited States  Net sales of  4 810 million advanced 1 1  year over year  During the reported quarter  pricing declined 2 8 percentage points due to commodity driven pricing activities in coffee and dairy  elevated promotions in ready to drink beverages and natural cheese  and unfavorable promotional timing in Lunchables  Volume mix advanced 3 9 percentage points buoyed by improvements in several categories Segment adjusted EBITDA plummeted 16 3  to  1 264 million  as gains from lower core commodity costs and improved volume mix were countered by reduced pricing  elevated net costs and costs related to strategic investments Canada  Net sales of  600 million went up 1 8  year over year  including a 4 2 percentage point adverse effect from currency translations  Pricing went down 1 7 percentage points as favorable foodservices pricing was more than mitigated by greater in store activity in certain categories  Volume mix jumped 7 7 percentage points  thanks to improvements in various categories Adjusted EBITDA rose 1 1  to  163 million  including currency woes to the tune of 4 4 percentage points  Improved volume mix and reduced input costs were somewhat offset by reduced pricing and escalated overhead expenses   EMEA  Net sales of  692 million dipped 1 1   including adverse currency impacts of 4 3 percentage points and a 1 9 percentage point unfavorable effect from a South African joint venture s sale  Organic sales grew 5 1  year over year  Pricing rose 2 6 percentage points  owing to favorable promotional timing in the U K   the Middle East and Africa  which was somewhat countered by reduced pricing in Eastern Europe  Volume mix advanced 2 5 percentage points  owing to gains in certain categories and regions  which were partially offset by reduced shipments in Africa and the Middle East Adjusted EBITDA declined 2 6  to  171 million  which includes currency headwinds of 4 3 percentage points  On a currency neutral basis  adjusted EBITDA grew 1 7   thanks to higher organic net sales  which was somewhat countered by greater overhead expenditure Rest of World  comprising Latin America and APAC   Net sales of  789 million inched down 0 8   with a 12 6 percentage point adverse impact from currency that largely countered gains from Cerebos  buyout and higher organic net sales  Markedly  organic sales were up 5 3   Volume mix improved 3 5 percentage points  fueled by solid growth in condiments and sauces in Latin America  This was countered by reduced shipments in Asia Pacific  Pricing jumped 1 8 percentage points  mainly owing to inflationary trends in certain regions in Latin America  partially negated by reduced pricing in China Adjusted EBITDA fell 6  to  134 million  due to currency headwinds of 31 8 percentage points  On a currency neutral basis  adjusted EBITDA rallied 25 8  on increased organic net sales  partly negated by elevated input costs FinancialsKraft Heinz ended the quarter with cash and cash investments of  1 130 million  long term debt of  30 873 million and total shareholders  equity of  51 903 million In a separate press release  Kraft Heinz announced a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share  which represents a decline from the company s previous quarter s dividend of 62 5 cents  The new dividend is payable on Mar 22  2019  to shareholders of record as on Mar 8 OutlookManagement expects to continue with organic sales growth in 2019  on the back of additional consumption gains stemming from improved volume mix  This  in turn  is expected to be fueled by innovation  whitespace and distribution endeavors  and pricing activities  These are likely to help Kraft Heinz battle cost related worries However  organic sales are anticipated to decline in the first quarter due to unfavorable year over year comparisons  Further  currency headwinds and divestitures are expected to hurt net sales by 3 4  in 2019 In terms of profitability  management expects adjusted EBITDA to decline at a high teens rate in the first quarter  owing to cost inflation and planned commercial expenditure  Although the company in undertaking solid pricing initiatives  these are not likely to yield until the end of the first quarter  Moreover  management expects the bottom line to witness impressive growth from 2020 In 2019  earnings are likely to remain pressurized by soft EBITDA  increased depreciation costs and elevated interest costs  among other factors  Though the company remains conservative about 2019  it is on track to deliver consistent rise in profits from 2020 on the back of improved cost structures  brand strength and enhanced capacities

I didn t see this deterioration in the S P 500 earnings estimate for 2019 coming nor did I think it would be as steep or severe as it has turned out to be 
Two strategists who did catch the deterioration early on were LizAnn Sanders of Schwab  Trinity controls all client assets with Schwab as third party custodian  and Bob Doll of Nuveen 
Going back and looking at the data from late September  18 forward  it was the  4 week change  in the 2019 S P 500 estimate that started to deteriorate first 

Note in the above data set how in late September 2018 the  4 week change  row turned negative and then really started to deteriorate in late November  18 
As a comparison  see spreadsheet data below   note the  4 week change  in the S P 500 2019 EPS estimate from 9 21 18 back through early May  late April 2018  reading from left to right  

 All data sourced from I B E S for Refinitiv

Summary
Jeff Miller encouraged me to start this blog in 2012 since Jeff knew I wrote about S P 500 earnings regularly  The problem  like any metric used for  predicting  the direction of the S P 500 is that one has to ask if the metric is a leading indicator  coincident  or even a lagging indicator  The 13  Q4  18 correction in the S P 500 and reviewing the data since tells me that the  4 week  change  in this case the 2019 EPS estimate  had some predictive ability at least to this last correction 
Although this blog has been around since 2012  S P 500 earnings data has been tracked since 2000  and as has been discussed in this blog many times over the years  The  forward 4 quarter  estimate  for the S P 500 didn t actually peak until the week of July 23   25  in 2008  just 5   6 weeks prior to Lehman defaulting 
When the long term chart of the S P 500 is overlaid on an S P 500 earnings chart  or vice versa  the two are usually highly correlated  particularly if you look at the 2001   2002 recession and then the 2008 recession  But the question remains is there a  leading indicator  type component to the earnings that would aid in  market timing  and if so  would the same indicator get you back into the S P 500 at near the bottom 
The S P 500 fell 13  in Q4  18 and is already up 11  in calendar  19 and more so if we look at the bottom from December 24th and December 26th  2018  and yet the S P 500 earnings data according to the first data set is just starting to get  less worse  from a rate of change perspective   So far anyway  if readers want a classic example of why not to  market time  the 4th quarter correction was it  even though the S P 500 really needs to take out the Sept  18 highs near 2 940 to assuage all the anxiety over what lays ahead  
But here is one aspect to tracking S P 500 earnings I ve found very helpful  analyzing the sector growth rates over time  noting in years like 2019 presently  when S P 500 earnings growth has been revised lower from 10  as of Oct 1  18 to just 4  today  the Financial sector has show little deterioration in its  expected  earnings growth rate of 9  for 2019 which has been constant over the same period   Maybe the Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  news around Berkshire  the sector s largest market cap weight  will change that growth rate the next few weeks   Clients remain overweight in the Financial sector  and that weight might be lifted even further 
In order words  watching relative sector growth rates has been a good tell for me as a portfolio manager  and divergent anomalies are even better tells  like Financials currently are showing 
The whole point of today s post was to take the time and analyze some of the data from the correction period in Q4  18  and then share the frustration with readers on picking out predictive tells  Will the  4 week rate of change  work for the next correction  Tough to say  You can bet I ll continue to watch it now 
What about full year 2019 S P 500 earnings  Will the benchmark s earnings growth be just 4    I actually think earnings growth should get stronger through 2019 as it did through 2016  but more on that tomorrow ",2019-02-23,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analyzing-sp-500-earnings-data-for-clues-to-q4-18-correction--was-there-a-tell--200391839,200391839

205612,427128,KHC,Kraft Heinz  KHC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Oscar Mayer meats  Jell O pudding and Velveeta cheese is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  6 95 billion  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 94  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kraft 
For Kraft  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 80  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kraft will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kraft would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  3 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kraft doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kraft-heinz-khc-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200388173,200388173

205621,427137,KHC,Kraft Heinz  KHC  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Oscar Mayer meats  Jell O pudding and Velveeta cheese is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 94 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 4  
Revenues are expected to be  6 95 billion  up 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 94  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kraft 
For Kraft  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 80  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kraft will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Kraft would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 78  delivering a surprise of  3 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Kraft doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kraft-heinz-khc-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200385794,200385794

205628,427144,KHC,What Cheesesteaks Can Tell Us About The Markets,opinion,"Another election is in the books  And the pollsters proved pretty accurate this go round  with few surprises from the ballot box 
We were left with two major takeaways from the 2018 midterm elections  One is that Democrats will be in charge of the House in January  The other is that Republicans held on to the Senate  Despite initial hints of a bilateral infrastructure plan in 2019  I d like to make a bold prediction   
The catchphrase for 2019 will be  partisan divide  
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia actually keeps tabs on this sort of thing  Its Partisan Conflict Index tracks political disagreement  It does so by monitoring the rate of newspaper articles printed about political conflict on the federal level 
So why does the Philadelphia fed track this  Its research suggests that with amplified political conflict comes increased financial uncertainty among businesses and households 
The Philly fed  Phed   contends that political uncertainty leads to slowed economic activity with reduced consumer spending and business investment 
An easy to follow  albeit slightly ridiculous  example is if legislative hostility prompts people to sock money away in a savings account instead of using it to buy something like cheesesteaks from the classic Philly institution Pat s King of Steaks  Pat s  in turn  buys less Cheez Whiz  And the share price of Kraft Heinz  Nasdaq  NASDAQ KHC  takes a hit  Behold the power of uncertainty 
That s not to say that markets   and cheesesteak sales   are headed south just because of a partisan clash  Investors have all but ignored political bickering the past couple of years  But it couldn t hurt to hedge your bets now that a partisan divide is on the horizon    just in case consumer spending and the markets slow down 
The best part  You can still make out even if the market keeps up a bullish pace 
Meet Your New Best Friend  Put Selling
The mere mention of options is enough to make most casual investors head for the hills  But not all options are created equal  And this one is about as safe as it gets  Here s how it works 
Take one of the blue chip stocks in your portfolio  Search for a put option with an expiration date about a year out and with a strike price 20  below the current value of that stock  So for a stock trading at  125  look for a strike price near  100   A strike price is the price at which shares of an underlying stock can be sold by the option buyer  
From there  place a sell order for that option and collect the income  It s a strategy that is exceptionally low risk and straightforward    But it s not without a downside 
You are selling something    and on the other side of that transaction is a buyer 
What they ve bought from you is the right to sell you shares of that company at the strike price if the stock s price drops below it  In that case  you would have to buy those shares at the strike price 
If you re using this strategy on stocks you already hold   and presumably like   then you ll end up buying those same stocks at a cheaper price  Even if it fails  you can still win 
Sounds like a good bet to me ",2018-11-11,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-cheesesteaks-can-tell-us-about-the-markets-200357916,200357916

205639,427155,KHC,Kraft Heinz   A Warren Buffet With A Secure 4 3  Dividend Yield,opinion,"Warren Buffett  Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  is arguably the greatest investor of our time  Through Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Buffett owns several privately held subsidiaries such as GEICO and Fruit of the Loom  Berkshire also owns large investment stakes in a number of publicly traded companies  Of the many Berkshire Hathaway stock holdings  income investors should take a closer look at food and beverage giant Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC   because of its high dividend yield of 4 3  
Kraft Heinz has had a difficult year  Consumer tastes are shifting rapidly in the U S   away from packaged foods  Instead  consumers are demanding healthier and fresher alternatives  such as organics  Kraft Heinz has been caught off guard by this  But it is investing in new products  and still has growth potential  particularly in the emerging markets  While investors wait for the turnaround  shareholders are paid well to wait with Kraft Heinz s high dividend yield of 4 3  
This makes Kraft Heinz a potential buy for value and income investors 
Business Overview   Current Events
Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz s largest shareholder  with over 325 million shares  Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 27  of the company  Kraft Heinz was created in 2015 in a merger between Kraft Food Group and H  J  Heinz Company  Today  it is a processed food and beverages giant whose product portfolio includes condiments  sauces  cheese   dairy  frozen   chilled meals  infant diet  and nutrition  A sample of its core brands includes Kraft  Heinz  Oscar Mayer  Velveeta  Maxwell House  Philadelphia  Ore Ida  Planters  and Kool Aid 
In all  Kraft Heinz has 8 brands that each collect  1 billion or more in annual sales  It has another five brands that generate  500 million to  1 billion in sales  and several more that each bring in  100 million or more in sales 

Source  Integration Presentation  page 4
Over the past several years  these brands have become household names for millions of consumers  It is possible that virtually every household in America currently has one or more of these products in their homes right now  At the same time  growth of these legacy brands has stalled 
Kraft Heinz reported its second quarter earnings results on August 3rd  The company reported earnings per share of  1 00  an increase of 2  year over year  Revenues rose by 1   hitting  6 7 billion during the second quarter  Kraft Heinz beat analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share last quarter  Sales growth last quarter included a favorable 0 3  impact from currency and a 0 8  boost from acquisitions  Organic sales declined by 0 4  for the quarter 0 4 percent versus the year ago period  Pricing increased 1 3   while volume and product mix had a negative impact of 1 7  last quarter 
Growth Prospects
Kraft Heinz s growth has slowed over the past year  but the company is still reporting positive growth  It also expects growth to accelerate heading into 2019  New products are being developed to better align with changing consumer tastes in the U S   and the emerging markets continue to be a major growth catalyst moving forward  For example  last quarter  Kraft Heinz generated 4 0  organic sales growth in its Europe  Middle East   Africa  EMEA  region  Growth was due primarily to 5  volume growth  which indicates strong product demand in these regions  EMEA segment adjusted EBITDA increased 2 9  on an organic basis last quarter 
Another growth region is Kraft Heinz s  Rest of World  geographic segment  which includes Asia Pacific and Latin America  This segment performed even better than EMEA  Rest of World organic sales increased 10 8  last quarter  due to 9 2  pricing increases and 1 6  volume growth  Kraft Heinz enjoyed especially strong results from condiments and sauces across these regions  Rest of World segment adjusted EBITDA increased 32  last quarter 
In addition to sales growth through higher volumes and pricing increases  Kraft Heinz s earnings growth will receive a boost from innovation  and tax reform  In product innovation  Kraft Heinz is investing aggressively in new channels  particularly e commerce  This is a highly attractive channel for strong consumer brands  as it provides the opportunity to sell more of their products to customers much faster than before  Kraft Heinz exceeded 75  e commerce growth in the U S  last quarter and over the first half of 2018  And  the company expects an effective tax rate of 21  for 2018  which will be a tailwind for earnings growth 
If Kraft Heinz can continue to grow earnings  even at a modest rate  shareholders are likely to generate high returns over the next several years 
Dividends   Expected Returns
One of the most attractive aspects of Kraft Heinz stock is its hefty dividend  The company currently pays an annualized dividend of  2 50 per share  Based on its recent share price  Kraft Heinz has a dividend yield of 4 3   This is more than double the average dividend yield of the S P 500 Index  The dividend payout appears to be secure  as Kraft Heinz is expected to generate earnings per share of  3 72 for 2018 according to consensus analyst estimates  This results in an expected dividend payout ratio of 67   meaning Kraft Heinz is likely to distribute roughly two thirds of its earnings per share  This is a manageable payout ratio  which even provides room for modest dividend increases moving forward 
The dividend plays an important role in Kraft Heinz s overall expected returns  Valuation changes and earnings growth will also contribute to shareholder returns  Even if Kraft Heinz grows earnings at a modest rate around 5  per year the stock will still provide satisfactory returns  Expansion of the price to earnings ratio could also fuel annual returns of 2   Kraft Heinz stock currently trades for a price to earnings of 15 4  compared with a fair value estimate of 17 0  which indicates the stock is undervalued 
The combination of valuation changes  earnings growth  and dividends  could result in total expected returns of more than 11  per year over the next five years  This is a highly attractive rate of return for a relatively low risk dividend stock 
Final Thoughts
Kraft Heinz  like many other large packaged food companies  was caught flat footed by the rapid changes in consumer preferences  And  the consumer goods industry is also grappling with raw materials inflation  which threatens to compress margins  This explains why Kraft Heinz stock has dropped 25  since the beginning of 2018 
However  Kraft Heinz retains a large portfolio of industry leading brands  It is bringing new products to market in new channels  and is expanding rapidly in the emerging markets  These catalysts should allow for continued growth over the next several years  In the meantime  investors receive a hefty 4 3  dividend yield  which pays shareholders well to wait

205640,427156,KHC,Food Stocks Q3 Earnings Scheduled For Nov 1  KHC  THS  INGR,opinion,The Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC    TreeHouse Foods  Inc    NYSE THS   and Ingredion Incorporated   NYSE INGR   fall under the  industry  which  in turn  is part of the broader  sector  Talking of consumer staples  the space largely includes essentials used in daily lives  which makes it a defensive zone Markedly  the sector appears to be in a decent shape this earnings season  reflected by the  as of Oct 26  A glimpse of the sector s performance reveals that nearly 27 6  of the S P 500 companies in the sector have already reported quarterly numbers  out of which 75  delivered earnings beat and 62 5  trumped sales estimates  Moreover  earnings grew 5 9   while revenues were up 1 8   For this earnings season  the consumer staples sector is expected to post earnings growth of 5  on a 1 1  rise in revenues On that note  let s take a sneak peek into how the food industry  which forms a vital part of the consumer staples space  is positioned for the to be reported quarter Is the Food Space in Good Shape Quite a few food companies have been witnessing input cost inflation  which along with persistently rising freight expenses are acute concerns  To top these  supply chain hurdles and rising competition have been marring the performance of many players in the Food   Miscellaneous industry  which is currently ranked among the bottom 21  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Nevertheless  we expect these companies  strategic endeavors like prudent acquisitions  impactful promotional skills and innovations to offer some respite  Additionally  cost saving and restructuring initiatives should help them combat high input and logistics expenses All said  let s delve deep into what s in store for Kraft Heinz  TreeHouse Foods and Ingredion Incorporated  which are slated to report third quarter 2018 earnings on Nov 1 Well our proven model shows that for a stock to beat bottom line estimates  it needs to have a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Here s What You Must Note About Kraft HeinzKraft Heinz s U S  segment sales have been declining for more than a year  with lower cheese shipments being a persistent headwind in many quarters  Sales in the region dipped close to 2  year over year in the last reported quarter due to reduced volume mix stemming from lower shipments of nuts  frozen items and cheese  We note that the U S  segment accounts for a major portion of Kraft Heinz s revenues  Hence  any sluggishness in the performance of this segment is most likely to affect the company s top line in the third quarter  In fact  Kraft Heinz has been witnessing soft sales in Canada as well  Apart from this  the company is battling escalated input costs  Unfortunately  third quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline at a greater rate compared with the decline in the first half of 2018  Management expects cost inflation  mainly freight  to put pressure on EBITDA Nevertheless  Kraft Heinz is on track with several initiatives to drive savings and optimize operations  These include efforts such as zero based budgeting and modernization along with capability building within the manufacturing footprint and building a performance driven culture in the company   Further  the company has various innovation initiatives planned in the foodservice space to fuel additional growth across all regions  Also  the company is making innovation efforts in the e commerce channel  which witnessed more than 75  growth in the second quarter  in the United States   Read More   Notably  Kraft Heinz s Earnings ESP of  1 86  combined with a Zacks Rank  3 makes us reasonably confident regarding an earnings beat You can see The Kraft Heinz Company Price and EPS Surprise    TreeHouse Foods  Can Strategies Offset Cost Woes Additionally  higher freight and commodity costs negatively impacted TreeHouse Foods  direct operating income  DOI  margins that declined across all segments  except Condiments  in the last reported quarter  Freight and commodity costs hurt TreeHouse Foods  gross and EBITDA margins as well  Unfortunately  freight and commodity cost headwinds are expected to linger in 2018  which is a threat for the impending quarter as well  Also  TreeHouse Foods has been witnessing a year over year decline in both top and bottom lines for five straight quarters now  Revenues in the second quarter of 2018 were mainly marred by the divestiture of SIF business and SKU rationalization  Also  sales were impacted by adverse volume mix  Unfortunately  the company anticipates the SKU rationalization efforts and soft volumes across most of its divisions to negatively impact top line growth in the third quarter   Nonetheless  TreeHouse Foods is on track with its TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan that has been designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole  Apart from cost savings  the initiative is expected to manage the company s portfolio  and optimize production and supply chain  We expect this strategy along with the company s Structure to Win program to help it battle cost related worries  Further  focus on acquisitions  and healthy and organic products should provide some cushion to TreeHouse Foods   Read More   Although TreeHouse Foods has a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult TreeHouse Foods  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   What s in the Cards for Ingredion Incorporated This Westchester  Illinois based provider of nutrition ingredients  sweeteners  biomaterials and starches has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters  For the quarter under review  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 70  which has witnessed a sharp downtrend over the past 30 days  Also  it reflects a decline from  2 21 per share reported in the year ago quarter Further  the consensus mark for revenues stands at  1 486 million compared with  1485 million recorded in the same period last year  Well  Ingredion Incorporated has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   which shows that the company is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this time around  In fact  we caution against Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5

I ll sum it up for you in 5 words  buy stocks with  accelerating  dividends  That is  payouts that grow faster and faster every year 
It s a double win 
Take Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd  NYSE RCL   a stock I focused on in a March 6 article  and still like today   Plenty of dividend investors look at RCL s current dividend yield a meager 2 0  shrug and walk away 
Terrible move 
I ll show you why in 2 charts   well  make that one chart with 2 different layers 
Let s start with this one 
 Accelerating  Payout Drives a 500  Income Boost 
That massive increase means folks who bought RCL in 2012 aren t yielding 2 0  on their original buy  They re doing more than 5 times better a monster 10 2  payout 
This retirement altering dividend is just the start  Because this soaring payout grabbed the herd s attention as it rose  pulling RCL s share price up with each hike 
A Stairway to Serious Gains
The end result  A 353  total return in 6 years  nearly triple the 119  the S P 500 returned in that time 
And with RCL trading at 14 times forward earnings  below its five year average of 14 8 and rival Carnival Corp   LON CCL  at 15 6  there s plenty more to come 
How to Get Safe High Dividends Now
But that isn t why I m writing you today 
This is  I m going to give you a one step indicator that lets you safely reel in dividends like 5   7  or 8   without having to wait 6 years to get there 
Let s move on to that now  including 2 stocks boasting safe payouts up to 8 3   plus one  thin ice  dividend you need to eject from your portfolio now 
My One Step Solution for Dividend Safety  and How to Use It 
My one step solution for safe  high yields revolves around one figure  the payout ratio  which you may know as the percentage of net income a company has paid out as dividends in the last 12 months 
A healthy payout ratio is the No  1 predictor of a growing dividend  But what most folks don t know is that there are 2  3  actually  different payout ratios and most people use the wrong one 
Problem is  the net income half of the ratio is an accounting creation that can be manipulated and often has little relation to the actual cash the firm is making 
KHC s  Real  Payout Ratio Looks Grim 
Take Kraft Heinz Co  NASDAQ KHC   a company whose reliance on yesterday s brands Velveeta  Jell O  Kool Aid and the like means it s completely missing the boat on the trend toward healthier eating 
Over the past 12 months  KHC s net income has come in at  11 0 billion in total  and it paid out just  2 9 billion in dividends  for a net income based payout ratio of 26  
Sounds safe  right 
Too bad its  other  payout ratio tells a different story  I m talking about the free cash flow  FCF  payout ratio  FCF is a snap shot of how much real cash a company is generating once it s paid the cost of maintaining and growing its business 
You get FCF by subtracting capital expenditures from a company s cash flow from operating activities  both figures are available under the  Financials  tab on Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance  
Look at what KHC s FCF has been doing in the last 12 months 
A Flapping Red Flag
That s right  KHC s FCF is negative  That gives the company a negative free cash flow payout ratio  meaning dividend growth could hit a wall or the payout could take a cut if management can t find a way to kickstart growth 
But as valuable as the FCF payout ratio is  there s one place where even this figure is of little use  That s when we re looking at real estate investment trusts  REITs   where yields of 5   7  and 8   are common 
 But HPT s  Visible  Ratios Hide an 8  Payout Set to Soar
Keep in mind that with REITs like Hospitality Properites Trust  NASDAQ HPT   a low key hotel and truck stop operator   we need to go one step further  because neither the net income based payout ratio nor the free cash flow based payout ratio are any help to us 
Here s what they have to say 
A Dividend Disaster  Not So FastSource  Ycharts com
Going by this  HPT s 8 3  dividend is in worse shape than KHC s payout  The REIT is paying 161  of net income as dividends and also daring to pay a dividend even though FCF is negative 
These numbers are enough to make even the bravest investor cringe 
But with REITs  we need to go with a different measure  dividends as a percentage of funds from operations  or FFO   the best measure of REIT performance 
We don t have to get into the weeds here  but generally speaking  FFO takes net income  then adds in depreciation and amortization  because real estate typically increases in value over time  and subtracts gains on property sales  For dividend safety  I pay particular attention to a REIT s normalized or adjusted FFO 
This figure is usually easy to spot in a REIT s quarterly earnings report  So based on HPT s last four earnings reports  the trust reported normalized FFO of  3 57 per share but paid out just  2 07 per share in dividends 
That means the FFO payout ratio is plenty safe at 58   making another dividend hike a solid bet when this REIT announces its next payout in April  And don t forget  that s on top of its gaudy 8 3  current payout 
Another Deceiving Dividend
Which brings me to another thing you need to watch with REITs  the fact that they can handle higher payout ratios than most investors think because their income rents paid by their various tenants is far less volatile than sales from  say  food makers or energy companies 
Which brings me to Easterly Government Properties  NYSE DEA  
You might look at the 87 7  FFO payout ratio on this REIT  which rents its 46 properties to government agencies like the FBI and Department of Veterans Affairs  and think its payout is in trouble 
But keep in mind that these clients aren t going anywhere  The bureaucrats love DEA s ultra modern buildings  the portfolio s average age is just 12 1 years  and that s reflected in the REITs occupancy rate of 100  
That s unheard of  DEA literally doesn t have a single square foot available for rent  No wonder this 5 2  payer regularly hikes its payout twice a year 
Dividend Soars Despite  High  Payout Ratio
To come full circle  if you d bought DEA when it first started paying a dividend back in May 2015  you d be yielding a nice 6 5  on your shares today  I expect folks who buy now will be able to say something similar three years from now 
Revealed  How to Retire on 8  Dividends Paid Monthly
I know many folks on the hunt for safe and growing 8   dividends with safe payout ratios to back them up 
Here s the secret  Reliable  outsized yields like these are far from being the mythical  unicorns  so many people wrongly believe they are  You just have to move one small step beyond the stingy names on the S P 500  and their pitiful 1 9  average dividends  to often overlooked income plays like the 2 REITs I just showed you 
But HPT and DEA are just the start 
Which is where the 8  perfect  retirement investments I want to tell you about now come in  I ve carefully crafted them into a unique  8  Monthly Dividend Portfolio  designed to do one thing 
Let everyday Americans achieve the retirement of their dreams on a reasonable nest egg  So you can forget about the million  bucks the pundits say you need to clock out of the workforce  As   they re just plain wrong 
The powerful set of stocks in my  8  Monthly Dividend Portfolio  gives you 2 unbeatable advantages 

A life changing 8  average dividend yield so if you were to invest  say  a  500k nest egg  you d immediately unleash a safe and growing  40 000 income stream  enough to let you clock out without having to sell a single stock from your portfolio to generate extra cash

Earlier  in Asia  markets ended the day largely higher  with the Shanghai Composite in China closing up around 1 2   while Japan s Nikkei edged up about 0 1  
2  Dollar little changed as traders weigh Fed rate hike outlook
The dollar was little changed against a basket of the other major currencies on Monday  lacking direction as market players awaited further hints on the timing of the next U S  rate hike 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was at 100 85 in early New York morning trade  almost unchanged for the day 
In the week ahead  global financial markets will focus on minutes of the Federal Reserve s latest policy meeting as well as housing related data for more clues on the timing of the next U S  rate hike 
There are also more than a few Fed speakers this week  including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart 
Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said in a speech in Singapore on Monday she would be  comfortable  raising interest rates at this point if the economy maintained its current pace of performance 
Fed fund futures priced in a less than 15  chance of a rate hike in March  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  Odds of a June increase was seen at around 70  
3  European politics  Greece remain in focus
Developments in the French presidential election remained in focus after weekend talks aimed at finding a leftist unity candidate for France s presidential election showed little sign of progress 
News that Socialist Benoit Hamon and hard left rival Jean Luc Melanchon were discussing cooperation in their bid for the presidency rattled markets on Friday 
Investors believe such a tie up could possibly knock centrist Emmanuel Macron out of the race in the first round and propel far right  anti globalization candidate Marine Le Pen into the Elysee palace 
Over in Germany  the center left Social Democrats  SPD  moved ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative Christian Democrats  CDU CSU  in an opinion poll for the first time since 2006  Bild am Sonntag said on Sunday 
Meanwhile  former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi resigned as head of the ruling Democratic Party  PD  on Sunday  opening the way for a leadership fight in which he will take on rivals threatening to split the center left

Shares in Anglo Dutch consumer goods group Unilever PLC  LON ULVR  fell sharply on Monday after U S  rival Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  abruptly ditched its surprise  143 billion merger proposal 
Unilever s London listed shares  which jumped 13  on Friday when the approach was made public  fell as much as 8  in early trading on Monday 
A Kraft Heinz spokesperson said it had hoped to negotiate on a  friendly basis   but decided to drop the bid when Unilever made it clear it  did not wish to pursue a transaction  
5  Japan export growth slows
Japan s exports rose in January at a slower pace than the previous month due to a decline in shipments to the U S  and the Lunar New Year holidays and as concerns about growing trade protectionism cast doubts over the outlook 
Exports in January rose 1 3  from the same period a year ago  below forecasts for a 4 7  annual increase and slower than a 5 4  year on year increase in December 
Meanwhile  imports into the world s third largest economy posted their first increase since December 2014  rising 8 5   as oil prices rose

205693,427209,KHC,Unilever  UL  To Buyback Dutch Preference Shares For  528M,opinion,"In an attempt to simplify its capital structure  Unilever  LON ULVR  PLC   NYSE UL   is apparently considering to buyback around  520 million preference shares from Dutch institutional investors   As the consumer products giant is listed both in Amsterdam and London the move is likely to help the company improve corporate governance 
Per sources  Unilever has agreed to buy the 6  and 7  preference shares in Unilever N V  held by NN Investment Partners and insurer ASR Netherlands  It will launch a public offering for the shares  which will value the outstanding 6  and 7  cumulative preference shares at  450 million   528 million  
The offering is expected in the third quarter of this year and is likely to be completed in the fourth quarter  After the completion  Unilever intends to acquire the remaining preference shares and to terminate the listings on Euronext Amsterdam Unilever PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    The need to simplify the company s capital structure rose when shareholders compelled Unilever to review its business structure after the Anglo Dutch company rejected a  143 billion takeover bid by Kraft Heinz Co    NASDAQ KHC   in Feb 2017  The maker of Dove products and Ben   Jerry then undertook a business review to strengthen its position in a world of mergers and acquisitions and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry 
In this regard  Unilever has divested its underperforming businesses and   including brands like Flora and Stork butter  in April  Unilever also plans to integrate its food and refreshment businesses into a Netherlands based unit  Furthermore  the company has announced hike in dividends  by 11  in June   raised cost savings target through its Connected 4 Growth  C4G  program announced last year  The program was undertaken to reduce costs  under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over  This has generated savings of more than  1 billion in the first half of year 2017  which is a step closer towards its target of  6 billion and a targeted underlying operating margin of 20  by 2020  Moreover  it has set a target for net debt of two times EBITDA  which would mean enough flexibility for acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders 
The company expects these actions to deliver underlying sales growth in the 3 5  range in 2017  The company anticipates accelerating growth in the second half of the year driven by the phasing of the innovation plans and a step up in brand and marketing investment 
Meanwhile  Unilever continues to struggle with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia  Further  the company is witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe  Additionally  it has been delivering weak results for the past few quarters due to sluggishness in the emerging markets  which account for about two thirds of the company s total revenue  Though the emerging markets offer robust long term prospects  they are generally volatile

The company has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews  aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry 
Unilever has also undertaken a program called Connected 4 Growth to reduce costs  under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over  Meanwhile  the company continues to struggle with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia  Further  it is witnessing softness in the developed markets in North America and Europe with little signs of recovery  Nevertheless  we expect the company will be able to offset these headwinds with the above mentioned efforts  Unilever currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

205711,427227,KHC,Church   Dwight Or Unilever  Which Stock Is More Appealing ,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been drawing investors  attention of late  backed by an improving economy and rising consumer confidence  Improved labor market optimism and gradual wage acceleration are doing the trick for the stocks in this space and are driving consumer confidence  a key determinant of the economy s health 
Consumer confidence improved moderately during the month of June  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path after a dismal show in the month of May 
Steady job additions and persistently low unemployment have have helped the household wealth to increase  This in turn  boosted consumer spending  The recent hike of its benchmark interest rate by Federal Reserve reiterates the fact that the economy is in good shape  Further  the Fed indicated that it anticipates the next hike in December  along with three more in the coming year  which signals rising consumer confidence as well as the U S  economy s growth 
Although the  sector  which is at the bottom 44  of the Zacks Sector Rank  9 out of 16   has not been an outstanding performer  it still holds promise  given the favorable economic indicators  Meanwhile  if we look into the performance of the Zacks categorized  industry  which is a part of the broader consumer staple sector  we will see that out of the 260 plus industries  the industry is placed among the top 4  of Zacks classified industries and holds a Zacks Industry Rank  10  To learn more visit   
Having said this  let s try to ascertain which of these two key food players   Church   Dwight Co   Inc    NYSE CHD   and Unilever Plc   NYSE UL    presently make for a better investment option 
Both the stocks carry Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which highlights the fact that it is likely to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  as per our proprietary Zacks Rank which is designed to predict price movements over the next one to three months  You can see 
Ewing  NJ based Church   Dwight is the world s leading producer of baking soda and has delivered positive earnings surprise in 10 out of the 13 consecutive quarters  It has also reported positive sales surprise in 11 of the past 13 quarters 
We believe that stable portfolio of value and premium products  judicious management of overhead expenses along with robust sales and earnings growth will help propel the stock However  the company has been witnessing pricing pressures  rising commodity costs  stiff competition and weak consumer demand in many markets  The company also remains exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations  which might hurt sales and profits 
On the other hand  Unilever  the Anglo Dutch company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders as well as indulge in more aggressive cost cuts  after Unilever rejected Kraft Heinz Co  s   NASDAQ KHC    143 billion surprise offer on Feb 17  The maker of Dove products and Ben   Jerry s seeks to evaluate options regarding its portfolio  organization  cost structures  balance sheet and use of cash 
The company is acquiring brands in order to fortify its position in personal care and home care segment  Besides acquisition  Unilever is also divesting its underperforming businesses  Furthermore  the company announced that it would buy back shares  hike dividends  raise cost savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses 
Market Capitalization
Unilever s market capitalization is  68 39 billion  while that of Church   Dwight is just  12 91 billion  Going by its business size  Unilever is better positioned over the long term owing to its massive scale of operations 
VGM Score
We note that the  is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks  In order to screen out potential winning stocks  we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy  and a VGM score of  A  or  B  
In that case  Unilever seems to outpace Church   Dwight on VGM Score as well  Unilever s VGM Score of  A  is favorable than Church   Dwight s VGM Score of  C   Hence  we should consider it a favorable investing option 
Price Performance
The performance of the companies is well reflected in the prices over the past six months  While shares of both the companies have outperformed the Zacks categorized Soap   Cleaning Preparations industry and the broader Consumer Staples sector  those of Unilever have significantly outpaced the sub industry  While Unilever s shares have moved up 32 3   Church   Dwight have rallied 16 1  since the last six months  The industry has grown 13 3  since the last six months  while the sector grew 8 5  

 

Estimate Revisions
Upward estimate revisions are indicative of positive investor sentiment about a stock  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Unilever has increased 4 1  for full year 2017 and improved 4 0  for 2018 over the last 60 days  On the other hand  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 increased 1 6  for Church   Dwight  while the same has gone up 2 0  for 2018 over the last 60 days  This clearly shows that Unilever has been growing strongly 
Unilever s earnings for the full year 2017 and 2018 are expected to grow 22 1  and 13 8   respectively  The growth rate is however subdued in the case of Church   Dwight  where earnings per share are projected to increase 8 9  and 7 8  in the coming years 
The above arguments clearly state that Unilever is better placed currently and should offer great value to investors

Berkshire holds more than 80 companies including the Burlington Northern railroad  Geico car insurance  Benjamin Moore paint  Dairy Queen ice cream  Fruit of the Loom underwear  and See s candies  and owns more than  115 billion of stocks 
Its breadth and depth  which includes  63 7 billion of cash  has given Berkshire a strong balance sheet that Buffett said will help it thrive should the economy  propped up by low interest rates that many expect to rise soon  heads south 
 We will be very willing to act if economic turbulence of any kind occurs  and will be prepared  and most people won t be   he said  He denied that Berkshire needed special regulatory oversight by possibly having become too big to fail 
SUCCESSION
Buffett gave no hints about who would succeed him  He also alluded in one answer to his writing another of his popular letters to shareholders next February  suggesting no intention to leave soon 
Yet he said he would not want someone whose sole background is in investments to become chief executive   I would not want to put someone in charge of Berkshire with only investing experience and not any operational experience  
Buffett also offered ringing praise for the turnaround at Burlington Northern  Berkshire s largest noninsurance unit  which was plagued last year by service delays 
 The improvement has been huge  and I want to thank Matt Rose and Carl Ice for their really extraordinary performance   he said  referring to the railroad s executive chairman and chief executive 
Rose  considered by some a potential Berkshire CEO candidate  was not mentioned by Buffett in his annual letter  which led some to believe his standing had been lowered 
Other potential CEO candidates include insurance executive Ajit Jain  whose decision to join Berkshire three decades ago was hailed by Buffett as one of the  luckiest  events he experienced  and Berkshire Hathaway Energy chief Gregory Abel  who talked at the meeting about renewable energy  He was the only person other than Buffett and Munger to field a question 
Ken Shubin Stein  founder of Spencer Capital Management LLC in New York  said having a CEO with an operational background  makes sense since the CEO needs to work with the investment team and understand their use of capital for investments  versus using the capital for investing in acquisitions  
3G DEFENDED
As is usually the case  no major controversy has been hanging over Berkshire 
But Buffett did get two questions that led him to praise 3G Capital  which critics say ruthlessly cuts jobs at companies it acquires  In 2013  Berkshire and 3G bought H J  Heinz Co  which is now buying Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KRFT  
 The 3G people have been successful in building marvelous businesses   Buffett said   I don t know of any company that has a policy that says we re going to have a lot more people than they need  
Buffett also defended Berkshire s Clayton Homes manufactured homes unit  which was criticized in a recent Seattle Times article for predatory sales practices that can trap low income borrowers in homes they cannot afford 
 I make no apologies whatsoever for Clayton s lending terms   he said  adding that Clayton itself faces losses when borrowers default 
Buffett also said he expects a contentious contract dispute between Berkshire s luxury aircraft unit NetJets and its pilots to be resolved  and said he had  no anti union agenda whatsoever   Some of the pilots picketed outside the meeting 
Addressing a question about Berkshire s stakes in companies including Coca Cola Co that sell highly sugared products  Buffett said companies can change as consumer tastes evolve 
Alluding to his own well publicized fondness for junk food  he said   If I had been eating broccoli and Brussels sprouts all my life  I don t think I would live as long  
Buffett also said the euro currency  can and probably should survive   but that  real changes  would probably be required 
Munger  for his part  said European leaders created a  flawed system  that was  probably unwise  by letting countries that were too weak adopt the currency 
DEVOTEES LINED UP EARLY
Berkshire s annual meeting is Omaha s top annual draw other than baseball s College World Series   reflected in hotel rooms that can fetch more than  400 a night and that often sell out nearly a year in advance 
Devoted and sleep deprived shareholders began lining up outside the venue hours before doors opened at 7 a m  CDT 
Kyle Cleeton  a research analyst for an investment firm  may have gotten there first  saying he showed up at 10 p m  the night before 
 I wanted to be first in line   he said   You re not sure how many more years you re going to have

Of course  before the Brexit decision  London benefited from being Europe s biggest financial centre besides being home to a variety of activities and services offered to a multi cultural and cosmopolite population  The city was the perfect melting pot  and therefore could capitalise on its very unique title  Unfortunately  London s position at the heart of Europe and the European financial place is at risk after the UK decided to walk out the European Union

205740,427256,KHC,Brexit s Bill  UK Consumer In Trouble,opinion,"Brexit bill in the Lords
With Parliament back in session  Brexit is back to being the number one concern for the pound  A year ago to the day  David Cameron strode out of the 10 Downing Street and announced the date of the referendum on the UK s membership of the EU would take place on June 23rd  The pound fell and as of this morning is still a little over 10  lower than it was 12 months ago 
Of course  Article 50 is yet to be triggered let alone a formal Brexit but passage of the government s EU bill will now hit the Lords  Indeed  it is set and expected to be a rather quiet week with little out of the Eurozone  a US holiday today and limited central bank action due  Brexit will likely be the marquee news driver 
UK consumer in trouble
As we had told you earlier last week  our thoughts were that UK retail sales would slip in January after an exuberant November and a poor December  Even we were surprised by the fall however and while these month on month figures can be volatile  the 3 month trend suggests that the UK consumer is not waving but drowning  Indeed  last week s slew of increasing inflation and slowing wage growth is kryptonite for the High St and UK GDP as a whole 
There had been some doubts over the dovishness of the Bank of England post Brexit but we believe that Mark Carney will emphasise tomorrow at his testimony in front of the Treasury Select Committee that the situation would be worse without the Bank s decision to cut rates in August  With an ill wind of UK economic data behind him Carney will be in control of the discussion and would represent a risk to the pound 
Kraft  NASDAQ KHC  and Unilever  NYSE UN  end talks
The other sterling news is that Kraft who had tabled an offer to buy Unilever and had their initial approach rejected have pulled back from the bid  While this deal is not going ahead at the moment and of course may never do so  the trend is clear 
Indeed  as much as the ARM Softbank merger that took place in July last year was hailed as a great big thumbs up for the UK  a deal that size is needed each quarter for sterling to maintain a normal level of buying interest  We do not have that many ARMs left and political jostling can easily limit buying interest in a currency 
EUR USD slips on French political risk

The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is up about 0 25   led by telecom and financials  The index gapped higher but held below last week s high  which was the best level since December 2015  The gap is small  370 76 370 88   The fallout from Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  withdrawing its bid for Unilever  LON ULVR  appears localized 
Benchmark 10 year bond yields are mostly one two basis points higher  There does not seem to be much reaction to the weekend political developments  where Renzi has stepped down as PD chairman as a leadership battle is waged that could split the center left party  which is seen as increasing the chances of electoral success by the 5 Star Movement  Also  the possibility of the united left candidate in France appears to have diminished  and Macron was criticized for comments critical of French history in Africa  The meeting of European finance ministers is not expected to reach an agreement to make another tranche payment available to Greece  but Greek bond yields are slightly softer  As we have noted  Greece does not need the funds until early Q3 and brinkmanship tactic requires approaching the brink 
The economic calendar is light today  There are three main features  Japanese trade  Germany producer prices  and UK CBI trends  Japan s January trade deficit was larger than expected  as exports disappointed and imports surprised on the upside  It was the first deficit since last August  There is a large seasonal component  and in most commentary  it is attributed to the Chinese New Year  We are a bit skeptical and note that for more than 20 years  which means even before China became Japan s largest trading partner  the seasonal pattern was evident 
Japan s January trade balance always deteriorates from December  Moreover  Japan s exports rose in China  3 1  year over year  while shipments to the US and Europe fell  6 6  and 5 6  respectively   Exports of motor vehicles fell 6 7  year over year in value terms  Crude oil imports surged 36  in value terms  Exports were off 0 3  in volume terms  The shortfall of JPY1 087 trillion was the largest since January 2015 
German producer prices surged 0 7  in January  This is twice the pace the median forecast had anticipated in the Bloomberg survey  The year over year rate surged to 2 4  from 1 0  at the end of last year  It is the highest reading since March 2012  As was the case with the surge in consumer prices  energy is the leading culprit  Energy rose 4   and mineral oils rose 20   Electricity prices increased 6 5   The base effect warns of additional upside pressure this month 
The UK February Trends report saw factory orders rise to the highest level in two years  The industrial order balance rose to 8 from 5  The median guesstimate anticipated a small decline  Price expectations also edged higher  The report lends support to other data that suggests the drop in the sterling has had a greater impact on inflation than exports  Sterling ticked higher on the news but may have put the session high in below  1 25 
More broadly  the dollar is mixed against the major currencies  Sterling is the strongest  gaining a little less than 0 5  to recoup most of the pre weekend loss  The Japanese yen is the weakest of the majors  losing about 0 3  with the greenback straddling the JPY113 00 area  The other major currencies are in narrow ranges and little changed  Among emerging markets  the Russian ruble is the strongest  with a 0 6  gain following Moody s pre weekend decision to upgrade its outlook  The South African rand is the weakest  It is off about 0 6  and is moving lower for its third consecutive session ",2017-02-20,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marking-time-on-monday-200176263,200176263

Kraft Heinz s stock  NASDAQ  KHC  climbed 10 74  or  9 37 at  96 65 in the market  reaching a high of  97 77 with a market cap of  112 72 billion and dividend yield of 2 48   Meanwhile  Unilever stocks climbed in the market on Friday as well   LON  ULVR   3 804   NYSE  UN   48 79  reaching a record of  114 billion to its market cap 
The company s stock plummeted  even though most of the European indices opened on a bullish note  due to Kraft Heinz s most recent announcement stating that the company is withdrawing their initial acquisition proposal for Unilever  which was rejected by the latter right away upon the proposal s announcement 

In a joint statement  Unilever and Kraft Heinz gave an official decision made saying   Kraft Heinz has amicably agreed to withdraw its proposal for a combination of the two companies  Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard  Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture  strategy and leadership of Unilever

Takeover Proposal RejectedKraft Heinz is a company backed by 3G Capital firm and American investor legend Warren Buffett  The company initially wanted to acquire the Anglo Dutch consumer company with a target for creating a global consumer goods brand  Kraft Heinz offered a  115 billion   145 billion  bid  but was immediately and unexpectedly rejected by Unilever 
Analysts speculate that Unilever CEO Paul Polman immediately rejected the offer seeing that Unilever will not gain any special financial or strategic merit our of the merger proposal 

 Kraft Heinz s interest was made public at an extremely early stage  Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis  but it was made clear Unilever did wish to pursue a transaction  It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value   states Michael Mullen  Kraft Heinz spokesman 

Several analysts believe that the reason behind Kraft Heinz s decision to simply drop the takeover bid was the current political environment in Britain  which is currently against foreigners making bids for large UK companies  even for the half Dutch Unilever 
Others believe that Kraft withdrew their bid because there are not willing to increase the offer price in order to go through with the negotiation  as Unilever initially made clear that they are not interested in seeing through a transaction with the American company  and that the initial bid offer greatly undervalues Unilever as a whole  ergo rejecting Kraft Heinz s offer right away 
In January  Unilever posted lower than expected fourth quarter earnings report  sending the company s stock to plunge ",2017-02-20,FSM News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unilever-plunges-after-kraft-drops-bid-200176276,200176276

205750,427266,KHC,3G to use its cost cutting playbook on Kraft after Heinz merger,news,"By Anjali Athavaley NEW YORK  Reuters    When Kraft Foods Group  NASDAQ KRFT  merges with H J  Heinz Co  they will share a name  a central place in the American kitchen and two headquarters near Chicago and Pittsburgh  But that dual office structure may soon change  according to some industry watchers  If history is any guide  their new owners will wrest an expected  1 5 billion in annual cost savings by 2017 by removing duplicate operations  slashing perks such as the use of private jets  while scrutinizing even the most mundane expenses   There is going to be a lot of headcount reduction   said Bob Goldin  executive vice president of food consultancy Technomic   You will see some portfolio pruning  They aren t going to have two headquarters for long   Heinz s backer  Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital Partners  has made a name for itself by aggressively trimming the fat from food and beer companies struggling for growth   3G is considered  the most aggressive in the industry in terms of running businesses on a very lean basis and maximizing margins and cash flow   said Kevin Dreyer  a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds  which owns roughly a million shares of Kraft   It s certainly a good thing for holders   3G Managing Partner Alex Behring made clear on Wednesday  when the  46 billion deal was announced  that it would implement a strategy of zero based budgeting at Kraft Heinz Co when it comes to the company s cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  The concept requires management to start each new budget year by justifying all costs from scratch  rather than the traditional method of basing their new budget on the previous year s figures and then only having to justify any changes  Some analysts say it is likely that 3G will exceed its savings target  It represents 6 percent of the cost base of Heinz and Kraft combined  according to Dave Novosel  senior analyst who covers both Heinz and Kraft for Gimme Credit  which provides independent research on corporate bonds    EXPENSES LARGE AND SMALL     When 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffet to buy Heinz in 2013  the cuts quickly followed  They included cutting 7 000 jobs in an 18 month period  closing six factories and many smaller curbs on spending   including limiting employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month   At the time  Pittsburgh based Heinz had separate offices to serve as its North American headquarters and its global headquarters  Those two operations were quickly consolidated into one  smaller office  according to a person close to Heinz  The copier restrictions extended to requiring printing on two sides of a page  and a reduction in the use of color printing  the person said  Investors and analysts have generally cheered the results  3G says that Heinz is now the most profitable food company in the industry   The changes are typical of 3G s playbook  When 3G backed Belgian brewer InBev NV acquired the largest U S  beer producer  Anheuser Busch Cos Inc  to form  Anheuser Busch InBev   BR ABI  in 2008  aggressive cost cutting soon followed  And after it took control of Burger King in 2010  3G slashed hundreds of jobs at the fast food chain s Miami headquarters  got rid of  swanky offices and sold the corporate jet  It also took labor and operational costs off its books by franchising more than 1 300 restaurants    When they see something that isn t working  they eliminate it   said Gary Stibel  founder of the New England Consulting Group  whose clients have included both Kraft and Heinz   It s a very healthy diet for the company  whether it s in food  beverage or otherwise  and it does work   He added   It s taken the food industry a long time to consolidate to this degree  It isn t over  Others will learn from what they re doing   To be sure  3G and Kraft highlighted on Wednesday the growth potential for the combined entity as well  Heinz gets access to Kraft s well known brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta  while the mac and cheese maker can use Heinz s distribution network to broaden its reach internationally   But in the United States  where packaged food makers have struggled to increase sales in the face of changing eating habits  boosting sales will be challenging

205753,427269,KHC,CFTC files suit against Kraft  Mondelez for alleged wheat manipulation,news,"Investing com    The U S  Commodities and Futures Trade Commission  CFTC  announced on Wednesday that it is filing a civil lawsuit against Kraft Foods Group  NASDAQ KRFT  and its spin off Mondelez International for alleged manipulation of the wheat futures and wheat spot markets 
In response to rising wheat prices in September 2011  the CFTC alleges that Kraft and Mondelez developed and executed a strategy to buy a six month supply of wheat for  90 million in futures  The company  according to the CFTC  had no intention to take delivery of the physical commodity  Kraft and Mondelez instead allegedly executed the strategy with the expectation that its long position would lower wheat prices on the spot market and widen the spread between December  2011 wheat with March  2012 wheat futures 
The company allegedly made a profit of more than  5 million on the strategic move  the CFTC said in a statement 
 This case goes to the core of the CFTC s mission  protecting market participants and the public from manipulation and abusive practices that undermine the integrity of the derivatives markets   CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman said in a statement   A market participant who is not happy with cash prices available to it may not resort to manipulative trading strategies in an attempt to artificially lower that price  
In addition  on five separate days in December  2011  the company held long positions that exceeded the Chicago Board of Trade s spot month position limit on wheat  according to the CFTC  At one point  the company exceeded the limit of 600 contracts by more than 2 100  the CFTC said in a statement

The deal would help Illinois based Hospira  which manufactures medical devices  to save on U S  taxes  in a process known as tax inversion that requires 20 percent of the company s shares to be held outside of the U S  The deal comes after AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV   the holding company for Abbott Laboratories  acquired Dublin based Shire Plc  LONDON SHP  for  54 billion in a similar tax inversion deal 
The practice has been criticized by U S  President Barack Obama who has said that companies indulging in the practice are harming the U S  economy by  cherry picking the rules  to save taxes  according to the Wall Street Journal  
 If you are basically still an American company but you simply change your mailing address in order to avoid paying taxes then you are really not doing right by the country and its people   Obama told CNBC in an interview last week 
It is not clear if Danone is talking to other companies as well for the sale of the medical nutrition division  which it had previously discussed with Swiss giant Nestle  SIX NESN   the Journal reported  citing a person familiar with the ongoing discussions  Neither Danone nor Hospira have confirmed the talks 
Danone entered the medical nutrition business in 2007 by acquiring Dutch company Numico  The division  which is responsible for baby food brands such as Nutricia and Cow and Gate  grew more than 7 percent  according to a company statement  in the first half of 2014  and gained ground in markets such as Brazil  Turkey  China and the U K 
In 2013  Danone s Nutricia unit in China was investigated following bribery allegations  which claimed that the company had bribed more than 100 doctors at 14 hospitals in Beijing  issued false receipts for reimbursements and gifts  and paid for doctors  junkets between 2010 and 2013 

In 2007  Danone sold its baked goods business to Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KRFT  for  7 2 billion  and since then  the company has entered new markets  including in Asia  to expand further

205779,427295,KHC,Diageo Upgraded To Hold Owing To Spirits Category Growth,opinion,"Diageo  LON DGE  plc    NYSE DEO   was upgraded to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  from a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on Sep 16  2016  Going by the Zacks model  stocks carrying a Zacks Rank  3 are likely to perform in line with the broader market in the quarters ahead 
The company has seen its stock price surge 9 03  over the past three months and nearly 3 33  on a year to date basis  The earnings for Diageo are expected to grow by 8 05  in the long term 
Why Upgraded to Hold 
Diageo  a global leader in spirits  has majority market share in nearly every spirit category in Europe and the U S   its two largest markets DIAGEO PLC ADR Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   We note that the spirits and wine market is benefiting from favorable demographic trends  The baby boomer generation is reaching its peak spirits and wine consuming age as they reach their 50s and 60s both in Europe and US  Younger generations are also consuming more spirits  Diageo is geared to capture the growing market of spirits and is innovating newer varieties of spirits to woo the growing consumer base  Further the company is penetrating fast into emerging markets with the help of acquisitions to tap the growing market in these areas 
Diageo is putting greater thrust on high margin products  With regards to its decision  the company ended a 16 year old distribution deal with Jose Cuervo  a non premium tequila brand in Dec 2013  and shifted towards more premium brands in America  The shift to high margin brand is expected to be beneficial for the company 
Though the above mentioned positive aspects boost our confidence in the stock  certain inherent issues raise our concerns for the same  Declining volumes has been a drag on top line for the past few quarters  Moreover  increasing restrictions on alcohol consumption by governments across the world have dented revenue growth 
Over the last 60 days  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock has been revised downwards for 2017 but raised up for 2018

205787,427303,KHC,3 Reasons To Invest In Kraft Heinz  KHC  Despite Soft Sales,opinion,"The Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC   is one of the largest branded food and beverage company in the world 
Kraft Heinz formed last year  was the result of the merger between packaged food company  Kraft Foods and ketchup maker  H J  Heinz Company  Previously known as H J  Heinz Holding Corporation  the company changed its name to Kraft Heinz post the completion of the merger on Jul 2  2015  The company started trading on Jul 6 
With a market cap of  108 7 billion  Kraft Heinz markets many iconic brands which enjoy long standing consumer recognition KRAFT HEINZ CO Price and Consensus

   However  Kraft Heinz is observing top line weakness over the past several quarters  Kraft Heinz  categories have slowed down owing to soft global retail and consumer demand  Consumption trends in a number of the company s key categories remain strained 
Why Kraft Heinz Is a Good Choice
Nonetheless  Kraft Heinz is a good investment choice  Here s why 
Good Rank  Rising Estimates and Share Price  Kraft carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Kraft Heinz  shares have had a good run this year  gaining around 23  year to date  Over the past 30 days  full year 2016 earnings have moved north by 5 5  while that for 2017 has increased 2 9  
Cost Savings and Productivity Improvements  Though the company s sales have been relatively soft  cost savings have led to better margins  mainly in the developed markets of the U S  and Europe 
While organic sales rose only 0 3  in the first half 2016  adjusted EBITDA rose over 25  on a constant currency basis 
Kraft Heinz has implemented many cost saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz  The company plans to save  1 5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017 focused chiefly on work force reductions along with factory closures and consolidations  In 2015  the company recognized nearly  125 million of cost savings from merger synergies of combining Heinz and Kraft businesses  The company generated about  535 million of cost savings in the first half 2016 
Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero based budgeting  modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint along with building a performance driven culture in the company 
A part of these savings are being re invested in the business for innovation  brand building and marketing to stimulate top line growth 
Aggressive Innovation   Marketing Efforts  With growing consumer demand for organic and more nutritional food  Kraft Heinz launched organic Capri Sun juices and Mac   Cheese dinner  under its Cracker Barrel brand  without artificial ingredients in 2016  It also renovated Kool Aid Jammers product with fewer calories and no preservatives as well as added a new line of Classico Riserva branded premium pasta sauces made with no artificial ingredients or added sugar  Further  frozen meals with enhanced nutrition is in the pipeline for launch this year 
Moreover  in 2016  the company will continue to focus on shifting advertising spend from non working  like production costs  advertising agency costs  to working media  digital  print advertisements  and eliminate inefficient trade promotion spending  In fact  management has plans in place to enhance overall marketing spending in markets like the U S  and Europe in 2016 
The company is also working for whitespace expansion of Kraft and Heinz brands in both food services and international channels 
Conclusion  If the company can manage to show some steady improvement in sales trends  it can be a great stock to own

 WASHINGTON  Sept 8  Reuters    Economic recovery may come
three months earlier than forecast  the head of the
International Monetary Fund said  but policymakers expressed
concern that it may not last if governments reverse stimulus
programs too early 
  For the  global  economy  we have been saying for a year
that the recovery will come in the first half of 2010  It might
even be a quarter ahead   IMF Managing Director Dominique
Strauss Kahn told Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper 
  We are seeing the end of the tunnel  but we are still in
crisis   he said in the interview published on Tuesday 
 A document obtained by Reuters on Friday showed that the
IMF had increased its forecasts for economic activity this year
and next  It is due to publish them later this week 
 On Tuesday  generally upbeat data from Germany  France and
Britain lent credence to the recovery scenario  which has sent
stocks soaring since March as fears raised by the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers a year ago proved to be unfounded 
 U S  stocks closed higher as rising commodity prices and an
uptick in merger and acquisition activity fueled hopes the
economy is strengthening  while the dollar fell to near a
one year low amid renewed appetite for risk 
 Global and emerging market stocks hit a 2009 high on
Tuesday  after rises on Monday when U S  and Canadian markets
were closed for a holiday 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 56 15 points  or 0 59
percent  to unofficially end at 9 497 42  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index was up 8 86 points  or 0 87 percent  at 1 025 26  The
Nasdaq Composite Index was up 18 99 points  or 0 94 percent  at
2 037 77 
 U S  Treasuries prices weakened as the higher stock prices
eroded their safe haven appeal 
 But governments and central banks were cautious 
 A senior member of the European Central Bank said in an
interview published on Tuesday that financial markets might be
reacting too optimistically to recent data 
  An overreaction to this data is not good  because it could
make us forget that governments still face a very significant
agenda of reforms  And without completing those reforms we
won t return to sustainable paths of growth   ECB Executive

 In China  one of the main engines of global growth over the
past 10 years  a senior cabinet official said the Chinese
economy was stronger but recovery was still not solid 
 State Councillor Ma Kai said Beijing would continue to
implement its policies to stimulate growth  which have included
a  585 billion fiscal spending package  tax incentives and what
officials have dubbed an  appropriately loose  monetary
policy 
 Finance ministers from the G20 economies agreed on the
weekend that now was no time to reverse the trillions of
dollars of stimulus pumped into the world economy  They say
they are waiting until recovery is established 
 POSITIVE DATA
 Data on Tuesday supported signs of a tentative economic
recovery  The Bank of France said the French economy    which 
like Germany  exited recession in the second quarter    is
expected to grow by 0 3 percent in Q3 
 German exports increased for a third month running in July 
fueling hopes that a recovery in Europe s largest economy has
gathered pace 
 In Britain  manufacturing output in July rose at its
fastest monthly rate in 1 1 2 years 
  These are good strong numbers   said Brian Hilliard at
Societe Generale   It is signalling that we are going to be
leaving recession in Q3  
 In the corporate world  Airbus  the world s largest
producer of passenger jets  said airline traffic had possibly
seen  the trough of the recession  and could start to rebound
from next year 
 A pick up in mergers and acquisitions activity has also
fostered belief in recovery 
 A  16 7 billion bid by North America s Kraft Foods Inc for

life in the corporate sector  even though the bid was
rejected

more than a week  buoyed by expectations of stronger economic
and demand growth in coming months  although analysts say
future price direction will depend on China 
 Battery lead and zinc also hit highs not seen in more than

 Traders said industrial metals were also helped by the
weaker dollar  which makes goods priced in dollars cheaper for
holders of other currencies 
 The dollar slumped to its lowest level in almost a year
against a basket of major currencies  weakening above the key
 1 45 level against the euro  as gold rallied above  1 000 an
ounce  Traders cited talk of reserve diversification into gold
as undermining the U S  currency 
 This in turn helped spur oil prices  NYMEX crude for

marking the largest percentage increase since Aug  19  London
Brent crude rose  2 89 to  69 42 a barrel 
 RISKS REMAIN
 But clear risks remain    most obviously climbing
unemployment and banks  continued reluctance to lend 
 Policymakers face a dilemma 
 They want to free up lending but are determined to impose
new rules on banks to prevent another credit bubble that could
be followed again by bust 
 Top central bankers said on Sunday banks would have to set
aside more profits as a cushion against hard times and face
limits on how much debt they could run up 
 Bank chiefs defended their business models on Tuesday
against new regulation that aims to put them on a tighter
leash 
 Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Joseph Ackermann told a
conference in Germany that regulators could choke off an
economic rebound if they made overly restrictive rules on how
much capital and liquidity banks need to hold 
  The consequences for credit availability and the price of
credit need to be considered   he said 
 But he acknowledged that banks did not have enough capital 
 And I deem it right that this has to be corrected   he said

205807,427323,KHC,Should You Invest In Kraft Heinz  KHC  In 2016  ,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on The Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC   is on May 26  2016 
On May 5  Kraft Heinz reported better than expected first quarter 2016 results 
The packaged food company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in first quarter 2016  Adjusted earnings per share of  0 73 surged 37 7  year over year on improved sales trends and cost savings  Organic sales inched up 1 1   reversing a decline of 3 1  in the previous quarter  on improved volume mix  Volume mix rose 0 8  in the quarter  while it declined 3 8  in the previous quarter  Volumes mix improved in all the segments   Europe  the U S   Canada and Rest of the World 
However  consumption trends remained weak in the quarter  Kraft Heinz  like many other U S  food producers  has struggled due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food 
Kraft Heinz s categories have slowed due to soft global retail and consumer demand  Consumption trends in a number of the company s key categories like ready to drink beverages  frozen meals and salad dressings remain challenged 
Category trends and market share performance is likely to remain under pressure in 2016 
Though the company s sales have been relatively soft  cost savings have led to better margins  mainly in the developed markets of the U S  and Europe 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has implemented many cost saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz  The company plans to save  1 5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017  primarily through work force reductions  factory closures and consolidations  In the first quarter of 2016  the company generated about  225 million in cost savings 
Other productivity improvement initiatives include programs such as zero based budgeting  modernization and capability building within the manufacturing footprint and building a performance driven culture in the company 
A portion of its savings is also being re invested in the business for innovation  brand building and marketing to stimulate top line growth 
With growing consumer demand for organic and more nutritional food  Kraft Heinz launched organic Capri Sun juices and Mac   Cheese dinner  under its Cracker Barrel brand  without artificial ingredients in 2016  It also renovated Kool Aid Jammers product with fewer calories and no preservatives and added a new line of Classico Riserva branded premium pasta sauces made with no artificial ingredients or added sugar  Further  frozen meals with enhanced nutrition is in the pipeline for launch this year 
Moreover  in 2016  the company will continue to focus on shifting advertising spend from non working  like production costs  advertising agency costs  to working media  digital  print advertisements  and eliminate inefficient trade promotion spending  In fact  management has plans in place to boost overall marketing spending in markets like the U S  and Europe in 2016 
These product innovation efforts and improved marketing spend can lead to better sales trends  going forward

205818,427334,KHC,Time To Buy Financial Stocks  2 High Profile Investors Think So,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
These are rough times for the financial sector  Of course  things have been tough for financials since the 2008 market crash 
But today s situation seems perhaps a bit worse  High volatility  general uncertainty concerning future interest rate hikes  fears of looming recession and anxiety over oil related loans are the main reasons for financials  current troubles  The aforementioned reasons damaged not only the profits of major banks  but also the value of their stock and market capitalization 
Indeed  this past Tuesday  Barclays  NYSE BCS   payment by more than 50   a result of previously announced losses of  548 3 million for 2015  compared to  243 4 the year before  According to the Wall St  Journal 

The  bank s  chief executive said shareholders  who have seen the value of their investment shrivel nearly 40  over the past year  were  tired  with the time it was taking to fix the bank 

Barclays isn t an isolated case either  though it may currently be the most prominent  According to Trinity Asset Management founder Brian Gilmartin  quoting from Reuters  data   Financial sector earnings are now expected to be negative for Q1 and Q2  16  
With Financials making up nearly 20  of the S P 500 by market cap  should you assume the entire index will be dragged down by the major banks  Or are there some hopeful signs emerging from the financial melt down 
Year to Date  Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  has been the best performer among major banks   it lost  only  13 6  since January 4th  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  didn t do much worse  dropping  just  14 7   With prices down   is this actually a buying opportunity 
JPMorgan s CEO Jamie Dimon surely thinks so  Dimon recently put  26 million of his own money into company shares at an average price of  53 18  This purchase is considered unusual  as most stock owned by top executives comes from company grants or heavily discounted options 
Similarly  there s a well known buyer snapping up Wells Fargo shares too  But  instead of the bank s CEO  it s Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  that were the buyers  According to Berkshire Hathaway s most recent filing with the SEC  the multi national conglomerate purchased about 9 million shares of the San Francisco based bank in the last quarter  adding to its already massive  23B position its second biggest holding after the  25B stake it owns in Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  
This of course shouldn t be taken as a signal that these two banks are primed for a quick stock price recovery  Both are exposed to the energy sector  and still have to deal with losses incurred by low oil prices 
Last week  JPMorgan announced it would put  500 million aside for losses related to oil and gas investments  on top of the  815 million it has already set aside by the end of 2015  Further  Dimon acknowledged the possible need to build more reserves  as much as  1 5 billion more  should oil hit  25 and stay there for 18 months  Wells Fargo on the other hand has dedicated  1 2B in reserves for potential oil and gas losses  although the sector represents only 2 percent of the bank s loan portfolio 
While these numbers may seem large  remember that JPMorgan has about  2 4 Trillion in assets  and posted a net profit of  4 9 billion in a very problematic 2015 Q4  Sure  that  4 9B profit was down about 10  from Q4 2014 s  5 4B  but annually  including the drop in Q4 profitability  JPMorgan s net income was up by  2 4B  or 12   from  20B to  22 4B 

Meanwhile  Wells Fargo s Q4 2015 earnings surpassed analysts  expectations and posted year over year growth  with an EPS of 1 03 against expectations and last year s number of 1 02  The company is still a leader in the mortgage market  as well as the second largest student loan organization in the US two key areas for growth in the coming year 

While earnings and revenues are bound to be hurt yet more during 2016  expectations call for a better  more profitable 2017  JPM s EPS in 2015 was  6  That s expected to fall to  5 78 in 2016  but forecasts call for it to bounce back to  6 41 in 2017  Similarly  WFC s EPS in 2015 was  4 12  That s expected to tick up a notch to  4 29 in 2015  with further upside arriving in 2017 forecasts which are estimating an EPS of  4 60 per share for the bank 
In short  these losses don t appear to be anything these global banks can t handle  Overall  both appear to be performing the way any healthy company would when it hits a rough patch  Bottom line  each is still in a strong position going forward 
The thing to remember about financial stocks is that often  they mirror investors  trust in the economy s growth  both domestic and global  Therefore  financial stock prices are not only hurt because of the objective losses from investments and exposures  but also by public sentiment 
It would seem that the intrinsic value of these two banks has not fallen as low as their stock price would suggest  We see that as creating a good buying opportunity for long term and value investors ",2016-03-03,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buying-opportunity-for-financials-200120241,200120241
205825,427341,KHC,Bubbles  Will We Ever Learn ,opinion,"Life is full of irony  When I was in school  I hated history  It was boring  It was pointless  How was reading about a bunch of dead people ever going to be useful in life  Today  I consume everything I can find on history  Particularly  financial history  Ironic 
Of course  it only took me 25 years in the investment world to realize that human behavior is quite fascinating  The capacity for optimism is seemingly limitless  but the  sting  of failure is quite transient 
While it is in those failures that valuable lessons are taught  studies have shown that humans tend to suppress or substitute new memories over time 
George Santayana once said 

 Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it  

The phrasing itself certainly is catchy  and is often used in the financial media due to its underlying truth  If history is a guide to the results of previous actions  and those results were painful  then history should guide not only policy making  public and private  but our own behaviors as well 
It s hard to disagree with  Over the history of the financial markets  all the way back to the 1600 s  speculative investing has repeatedly led to booms and busts  In 2007  as the markets were enraptured with the speculative sub prime lending and real estate boom  I gave a presentation containing the following two slides on past history 

Of course  I need to the Real Estate Financial Crisis of 2008 to that list 
Importantly  each of these  bubbles  involved an excessive level of speculation around some specific asset  In 2007  I highlighted  in red  the speculative levels of excess seen in certain areas   Note  It is important to remember that in 2007 the financial media did NOT believe there was a bubble being formed and that there was NO excess in the markets  

Of course  it is all rather obvious in hindsight  Valuations were high  the Fed was hiking interest rates and the love affair with stocks and leverage had reached historically high levels 
Today  there are many signs that the markets are once again approaching a  danger zone   Margin debt is once again at historically high levels  valuations are the second highest in history and the  love affair  with equities has pushed stocks to record highs  But these areas are really just a reflection of the excesses that are building elsewhere in the financial system 
The following are some areas of excess that are suspiciously similar to history

 For the wealthy  wine has become the ultimate liquid asset  With prices for top vintages soaring past  10 000 a bottle  fine wine is being bought  sold and traded at auction like a new investment class  with its own value indexes  investment funds and speculators  And now wealthy collectors are using wine as leverage   raising cash to invest in more wine and create even more wealth     
Borrowers are mainly using the money to buy more wine  betting they can pick the winners that will surge in value  which they can sell to pay off the loan and make a profit   similar to buying stocks on margin  Other wealthy borrowers are using the money for divorces or tax payments  or to buy a boat or a car  And many of the wealthy  especially business owners  have frequent short term cash squeezes

I could go on with automobiles  planes  collectibles and other completely stupid      all fetching record prices  but you get the idea  In an economy that is flush with liquidity  supported by low interest rates and wrapped in a speculative frenzy  there is little reason to worry about a downturn  But therein lies the potential lesson of history  We have been here before  but expect it to end differently this time 
The lessons of ignoring history are likely to be learned once again   the hard way ",2015-07-27,Lance Roberts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bubbles:-will-we-ever-learn-259638,259638

205841,427357,KHC,Spin Offs And Buy Backs  Getting the Most for Your Risk Adjusted Dollar,opinion,"Two years ago  when the former Kraft Foods Inc  broke itself up  spinning off its global food and beverage business   Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KRFT    the company renamed itself Mondelez International  Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ   Now  the company is mostly a global snacks business  The new Kraft Foods Group has done pretty well on the stock market since listing in September 2012  the position currently has an attractive dividend yield of 3 7  
Large cap corporate spin offs are typically highly profitable for shareholders  Despite a slow start  Mondelez has finally broken out of its recent consolidation trend on new operational momentum 
Mondelez sells cookies  snacks  confections  and cheese  Some of the company s iconic brands include  Cadbury    Oreo    Nabisco    Christie   and  Trident   among others 
The Street s been bidding  safer  stocks recently  and investors liked Mondelez s news of a restructuring plan and the spin off of its coffee business  which will net the company  5 0 billion in after tax proceeds 
Like many large cap public companies  Mondelez has been buying back its own shares  In the first quarter  it spent  500 million on its own stock at an average price of  34 20 per share  Its two year stock chart is featured below 

Chart courtesy of 
If you happened to be a shareholder of the former Kraft Foods Inc  then you ve done well with both spin off businesses and both stocks remain attractive holds 
Mondelez isn t offering as much income as the new Kraft Foods Group  its dividend yield is currently around 1 6   And while top line growth is always an issue for established large cap consumer brands  Mondelez is an improving earnings story that s what the Street is buying 
All year  the stock market has seemingly been going through an identity crisis  with very choppy action  no particular trend  and very tired trading 
This market looks to be breaking down  With speculative fervor and price momentum diminishing significantly in initial public offerings  IPOs   biotechnology stocks  highly valued technology stocks  and small cap stocks  recent action is a good reminder that investment risk is a more worthy consideration than expected return 
And while faster growing companies offer the potential for greater capital gains  owning the right dividend paying large caps has proven to be just as good an investment strategy with the added bonus of offering a lot less investment risk 
Sentiment has changed  as evidenced by the trading action in the market s most speculative stocks 
Big investors are buying less risk currently  and while the stock market shouldn t fully break down without participation from the Dow Jones industrials and transportation stocks  the risk adjustment that s just taken place is likely to be a key theme until the fourth quarter 
Earnings safety and dividends  to a lesser extent  are still what a lot of institutional investors want in a recovery economy that isn t yet able to sustain its own momentum without monetary intervention 
Stocks like Mondelez and Kraft Foods Group are poised for more gains  even if more speculative issues continue to break down  Dividend paying stocks continue to offer the best bang for your risk adjusted buck in this market

205842,427358,KHC,Is My Free Coffee About To End ,opinion,"There s a local bakery near my office I try to get to at least once a week  Sam and his wife own the bakery  and Sam is usually the one there serving espressos and cappuccinos to the many small business owners who meet there early in the morning to talk about business and the economy 
My problem is that I never pay for coffee at Sam s bakery   Don t worry Michael  it s been taken care of  is the standard line Sam usually gives me  Either Sam is giving me free coffee or one person is buying for everyone in the bakery 
But I think my free coffee streak is about to end 
Kraft Foods Group  Inc   NASDAQ KRFT  recently raised the prices of its Maxwell House and Yuban coffee brands by 10   This is after another company called The J M  Smucker Company increased its prices   Source  Bloomberg  June 8  2014  
But it s not just coffee prices that are moving up  Even the government itself is now predicting food prices will rise at an accelerated rate this year 
According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  inflation in food prices in the U S  economy will be between 2 5  and 3 5  in 2014  This is compared to just a 0 9  increase in prices in 2013  Inflation of meat prices is expected to be much higher  Beef and veal prices are expected to increase 5 5  and 6 0  respectively this year   Source  U S  Department of Agriculture web site  last accessed June 10  2014  
I believe food prices will rise much faster than what the government is predicting  I m talking real inflation of five to eight percent per year going forward  Why is this happening 
As I started writing here years ago when the Federal Reserve came up with the idea of printing money to stimulate the weak economy  money printing leads to inflation  The idea is very simple  the more paper money printed  the lesser its value 
To understand how inflation in the U S  economy will eventually look  we need to look at a country far away from the U S   India  Between the years 2009 and 2013  the M1 money supply  coins  currency  and demand deposits  such as checking accounts  increased by 72  in India and prices in the country increased by 61    Source  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis web site  last accessed June 10  2014  
During the same period in the U S  economy  the M1 money supply increased by a similar amount 71 3  to be exact  see the chart below   but inflation remained subdued  The U S  Consumer Price Index  an official measure of inflation in the U S  economy  increased by only 11 5  from 2009 to 2013   Source  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis web site  last accessed June 10  2014   Personally  I believe that this is because the U S  has changed the way it calculates its inflation rate and that inflation is running at a much higher pace than the government s official figures 
I warn my readers  inflation in the U S  economy is going to be a major concern going forward  There s too much paper money that has been created and it will show its ugly side very soon  Food inflation is just one place where prices are rising  What you can buy for  1 00 now will get you a lot less in the years ahead 
How can a small investor protect him herself from this  As inflation rises  interest rates will rise to cool inflation and that means investment real estate will fall in value  So I m not a fan of investment real estate going forward 
Today s depressed precious metal prices continue to offer investors a real opportunity to get into Gold and Silver  two great inflation hedges  at discounted prices  Both these metals should rise in value over the next five years as inflation accelerates

The chart of Mondelez above shows a long channel since it jumped higher following its earnings report on May 7th  The 50 day SMA has moved up through the bottom of the channel and gave it a lift 2 weeks ago  Today it is printing a bullish engulfing candle as it heads to the top of the channel at 38 50  There is support for a continued move higher from the RSI and MACD  both bullish and rising  And this is in a tape where the majority of stocks are moving lower  Technical analysis suggest that if it can break the channel higher then a move to 40 could be in the cards  Now that would buy some Oreo s

205844,427360,KHC,Whole Foods  Earnings Fails To Thrill Investors,opinion,"Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM  reported fiscal Q3 earnings and sales after the closing bell on Wednesday  and the results again failed to thrill investors  Though earnings per share  EPS  reached 41 cents in the quarter    beating the Zacks consensus estimate of 29 cents per share    revenues came in a tad light of expectations at  3 38 billion 
Whole Foods shares are currently experiencing a sell off of over 5  in the after market  based on the news  This follows a hopeful regular day trading increase of 3 8   Year to date  Whole Foods stock is down 32   making it the second worst performer on the S P 500 in 2014 thus far 
Comparable store sales disappointed investors  reporting an increase of 3 9   analysts had been expecting 4 6   and that was including the shift of the Easter holiday to Whole Foods  fiscal Q3  which was supposed to have provided a boost  it did  but only 60 basis points   Comp store sales through July  Q4  are up 1  so far  Whole Foods had earlier made mention of lowering prices to fight off a growing number of competitors  and gross margins are expecting to fall in line with historical norms in the mid 30  range 
None of this points toward explosive growth in the near future  Whole Foods produced  240 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter  Whether share buybacks or acquisitions    or neither    are in the cards for Whole Foods near term remains to be seen 
Another big name in Consumer Non durables  Kraft Foods Group Inc  NASDAQ KRFT   also reported after the bell  and missed on both top and bottom lines  EPS of 80 cents per share missed the Zacks consensus of 83 cents  and quarterly sales of  4 7 billion missed our expectation of  4 85 billion  Like Whole Foods  top line foods costs are weighing on profitability  though the company also cited strong free cash flow for the quarter 
Apparently  the processed food business is showing some of the same growth concerns as the organic foods market is  Perhaps it s time for two companies like Whole Foods and Kraft  with their decent sources of cash flow  to consider helping each other out ",2014-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/whole-foods'-earnings-fails-to-thrill-investors-221167,221167
