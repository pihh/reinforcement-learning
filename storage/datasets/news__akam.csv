121766,343281,AKAM,Fed comments on valuation fall flat with U S  fund managers,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Fed Chair Janet Yellen may have surprised the markets this week by noting that valuations in some parts of the U S  stock market look stretched but mutual fund managers mostly greeted her comments with a shrug 
Social media  small company and biotech stocks fell broadly Tuesday after the Federal Reserve noted that forward price to earnings multiples in those sectors appear  high relative to historical norms   It was the first time in 14 years that the U S  central bank had made specific comments on the valuations on a particular equity sector 
For mutual fund managers  however  it was added confirmation that the five year old bull market is showing its age  The benchmark Standard   Poor s 500 stock index has nearly tripled from its March 2009 lows  including a nearly 30 percent rally in 2013  The index  which for 2014 is up 6 9 percent year to date  now trades at a price to earnings ratio of approximately 15 6  above the 20 year historic average and signaling that low priced stocks are harder to come by 
As a result  fund managers are holding fewer companies overall and making trades less frequently  according to a recent report by Nasdaq OMX Group  Yet while the Fed may be correct that some parts of the market are overheated  fund managers say that they are still finding pockets of attractively priced companies that undermine fears of a widespread bubble 
 You have to try to draw a distinction between a broad brush sector and the individual stocks inside of it   said Eric Schoenstein  a co manager of the  5 3 billion Jensen Quality Growth fund  
Several fund managers echoed those sentiments  The notion that more speculative social media  biotech and small cap stocks now look pricey was a  statement of the obvious by Ms  Yellen   said George Shipp  whose  1 1 billion Sterling Capital Special Opportunities fund has logged the best performance among large cap growth funds for the year to date 
Shipp has positions in Myriad Genetics Inc  O MYGN   a biotech which develops tests that can assess a person s risk of developing a disease  and Akamai Technologies Inc  O AKAM   a company that essentially helps websites run faster  and is holding on to them because he sees the companies as  better established and lower risk for our shareholders   he said  Myriad shares are up 83 5 percent this year  while Akamai has gained nearly 25 percent in 2014 
Not all fund managers welcomed the comments by the Fed on valuations  however   Central bankers try to get granular in an effort to try to be more credible to market players  The problem is it invariably backfires   said Greg Peters  senior investment officer of multi sector funds at Prudential 
While stocks are somewhat pricey compared to historical levels  few fund managers voiced fears of a rerun of the late 1990s dot com bubble  Margaret Patel  senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management in Boston  said she could see valuations continuing to rise as strong earnings and sales growth prospects drive social media and biotechnology stocks higher 
She said she hasn t seen  anything that indicates that we ve entered bubble territory  even in high priced parts of the equity markets  
Jay Welles  senior technology analyst at Manning   Napier Inc  N MN   who advises funds like the  1 4 billion Manning   Napier Equity Series   said that not all social media stocks are overvalued 

 We re still finding companies like Facebook and LinkedIn that fit both fundamental and valuation criteria   he said  The fund held  14 million worth of Facebook Inc  O FB  shares as of June 30  and  11 million worth of LinkedIn Corp  N LNKD  shares as of the same date 
Yet the fund is not making a broad bet on the sector  he added 
 You really have to parse the sector and really do your homework  I think there are a lot of low quality social networking stocks  and recent IPOs  that are overvalued   he said   There s quite a bit of junk out there

121793,343308,AKAM,Akamai Technologies  AKAM  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Akamai Technologies basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Akamai Technologies imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Akamai Technologies
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this cloud services provider is expected to earn  4 17 per share  which is a change of 15 2  from the year ago reported number

121806,343321,AKAM,All You Need To Know About Akamai Technologies  AKAM  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Akamai Technologies is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Akamai Technologies  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Akamai Technologies
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this cloud services provider is expected to earn  4 27 per share  which is a change of 18  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Akamai Technologies  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

121864,343379,AKAM,Akamai Technologies  AKAM  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 02 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 1  
Revenues are expected to be  698 36 million  up 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 4  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Akamai Technologies 
For Akamai Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Akamai Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Akamai Technologies would post earnings of  1 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 07  delivering a surprise of  7  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Akamai Technologies appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/akamai-technologies-akam-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200409596,200409596

121884,343399,AKAM,What s In Store For Science Applications  SAIC  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Science Applications International Corporation   NYSE SAIC   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings on Mar 28 
The company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average being 21 9  
For the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  1 18 billion  reflecting a 4 17  improvement year over year  For earnings  the consensus estimate stands at 89 cents  indicating a decline of 23 28  year over year 
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
SAIC continues to benefit from a strong performance of its contract portfolio  The company s capability to sustain its existing contracts coupled with newly awarded contracts across the customer portfolio is a tailwind  Moreover  higher number of orders in its supply chain is a positive 
Further  achieving the AWS Government Competency Status last November is a critical advancement in the company s cloud practice  The status boosts the confidence of SAIC government clients regarding the effective integration of SAIC s technical expertise and knowledge of its AWS capabilities and services 
During the fiscal fourth quarter  the company was awarded a  57 million worth Seaport e task order with a year long base period and four more optional years by the U S  Navy  This task order followed another Seaport e task order worth  37 million  awarded to SAIC for providing the NSWC  Naval Surface Warfare Center   Panama City with its mission support services 
The company also completed the acquisition of Engility in the quarter under discussion  which is likely to help expand its market opportunity and drive its revenue and costs synergies 
However  it is feared that the partial government shutdown might have delayed new awards and contract wins for the company  Therefore  it remains to be seen how much impact the shutdown had on its top line Science Applications International Price and EPS Surprise

    
What Our Model Says
Our proven Zacks model clearly indicates that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive   Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  stocks are best avoided  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
SAIC has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP but its Earnings ESP of  1 72  in the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive this earnings season

121957,343472,AKAM,Why Akamai Technologies  AKAM  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM   This company  which is in the Zacks Internet   Services industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This cloud services provider has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9 16  
For the most recent quarter  Akamai Technologies was expected to post earnings of  0 83 per share  but it reported  0 94 per share instead  representing a surprise of 13 25   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 79 per share  while it actually produced  0 83 per share  a surprise of 5 06  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Akamai Technologies lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Akamai Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 75   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 5  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-akamai-technologies-akam-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200374859,200374859
121958,343473,AKAM,Akamai Technologies  AKAM  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 00 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  44 9  
Revenues are expected to be  703 71 million  up 6 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Akamai Technologies 
For Akamai Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 24  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Akamai Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Akamai Technologies would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  13 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Akamai Technologies appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/akamai-technologies-akam-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200383798,200383798

121961,343476,AKAM,Akamai Technologies  AKAM  Is Up 2 4  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Akamai Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if AKAM is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this cloud services provider holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For AKAM  shares are up 2 4  over the past week while the Zacks Internet   Services industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 11  compares favorably with the industry s 1 17  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Akamai Technologies have increased 3 26  over the past quarter  and have gained 3 99  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 2 29  and 3 64   respectively 
Investors should also take note of AKAM s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  AKAM is averaging 1 381 610 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AKAM 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 3 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AKAM s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 04 to  4 07 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 3 downward revisions in the same time period

122041,343556,AKAM,Facebook Roundup  Zuckerberg In EU  GDPR  Labeling Politics,opinion,"Zuckerberg was in the EU this week to answer legislators  questions  the first GDPR cases were filed against Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and the company launched a labeling system for political ads and news in the U S 
Zuckerberg Show in Europe Looks Like a Sham
Zuckerberg is getting really good at skirting around relevant questions and avoiding showdowns  such as with the UK   The Facebook CEO spent an hour and a half with EU regulators wherein he first delivered an apology speech  after which parliamentarians questioned him and then there was a final session during which he made an attempt at answering the questions by mostly repeating what he had already said in his introductory statement  The meeting format  facilitated by the EU parliament s president Antonio Tajani  was an interesting choice given the way it prevented any back and forth between legislators and Facebook 
The 2 7 million users  whose data was shared improperly with Cambridge Analytica just because they were using Facebook  aren t going to get any compensation  That s because  no bank account details  credit card information or national ID numbers were shared   reads a Facebook statement in response to the EU s concerns  The only things shared were relatively public information like the users  public profile  their page likes  friends list and birthday  Zuckerberg   Co  figure that the company doesn t owe anything for what it admits was a breach of trust 
As far as information collection on non Facebook users is concerned  Facebook says that it discloses what it collects and that it expects other websites and apps to do the same via their cookie policy  Facebook also clarifies that it doesn t profile them although they can still find out what data was collected on them  This doesn t make much sense because how can a user find out all that Facebook has collected on her if it hasn t been put together by Facebook and isn t that what profiling is about 
On sharing data between Facebook and WhatsApp  it piously claimed that it was necessary to help fight abusive content or spam on its services 
Meanwhile  users in Amsterdam formed what they called a  Datavakbond  or  data labor union   to negotiate directly with Facebook and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  on data usage matters and also perhaps push for the creation of a paid service that wouldn t collect data  The group demands  reasonable compensation  or at least better working conditions  for the data supplied  Although based in the Netherlands  the union is looking to rope in users from across the world 
First GDPR Complaints
Long time Facebook critic Max Schrems wasted no time in filing complaints under GDPR against Facebook  Facebook owned Instagram  Facebook owned WhatsApp and Google s Android on behalf of unnamed individual users  The complaints were filed through his not for profit organization called noyb  none of your business  with data protection agencies in Austria  Belgium  France and Hamburg in Germany since these countries already have data protection agencies with a strong record of defending privacy rights 
The bone of contention is forced consent  i e  Facebook blocking users that don t consent to data collection  Since the law requires that compulsory consent can only be obtained where it is necessary for the provision of the service  courts will now be required to clarify whether targeted advertising is a strictly necessary part of providing a social networking service  If guilty  it may be liable for a fine of up to 4  of its global revenue 
The Facebook response  through chief privacy officer  Erin Egan was   We have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the GDPR  We have made our policies clearer  our privacy settings easier to find and introduced better tools for people to access  download  and delete their information  Our work to improve people s privacy doesn t stop on May 25th  For example  we re building Clear History  a way for everyone to see the websites and apps that send us information when you use them  clear this information from your account  and turn off our ability to store it associated with your account going forward  
So in a way  Facebook admitted that everything required to be GDPR compliant wasn t completed by May 25 but it was promising compliance sometime soon  Lawmakers may consider its approach given that the scope and scale of the new law doesn t have any precedent 
This is just the beginning of a new era as promised by noyb  which was set up with the sole purpose of  strategic litigation  around the EU s GDPR policy 
Labeling Political Ads News
Facebook has launched an initiative in the U S  that will see all political ads and content  including from reputed news publishers containing the  paid for by  label  Clicking on the label takes users to an archive of records about who paid for the content as well as the location  age and gender of people that saw it  Facebook is including not just political content but also around 20  issues  that play a role in elections such as abortion  guns  immigration and foreign policy   
The News Media Alliance  representing about 2 000 publishers including the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal isn t thrilled because its members don t appreciate being lumped with  lesser  organizations that might however be reporting the truth 
 Your plan to group quality publishers alongside political advocacy  which the ad archive will do  dangerously blurs the lines between real reporting and propaganda   the group s CEO David Chavern said in a letter to Zuckerberg   This treatment of quality news as political  even in the context of marketing  is deeply problematic   One might wonder what the problem is with labelling political news as such  but there s a reason for this approach  the group wants the creation of an elite club that will admit them to hide their funding sources but not others  
Facebook representatives initially said that they would deal with news publishers separately and not through News Media Alliance and also that they had made good progress with them  But Bloomberg reported that within hours of its publishing the news along with the opposition from the News Media Alliance  Facebook decided to rethink the plan  Talk about politics 
Facebook Home Services
Facebook added home services to its marketplaces through partnerships with Handy  HomeAdvisor and Porch  The service lists home service professionals  along with reviews  locations and credentials  who can also be contacted through Facebook Messenger 
Deb Liu  vice president of Facebook s Marketplace says that  More people ask for recommendations related to home services on Facebook in the US than any other topic  Since the beginning of the year  millions of people have asked their friends for suggestions related to home services  such as house cleaners  plumbers and contractors   Facebook must be listening closely 
Russia to Investigate Facebook  WhatsApp
The TASS news agency reports that Russia s telecommunications watchdog Roskomnadzor is investigating Facebook and WhatsApp to see if the companies are in compliance with a Russian law that requires the location of user data on Russian servers  The investigation is expected to be completed by December

122043,343558,AKAM,International Opportunities Abound For Leading Internet Retailers,opinion,"Retail ecommerce remains a fairly small part of total retail right now  but because it is a fast growing part  it is increasingly accounting for a larger share  Just a year ago  we were looking at a mid single digit share  but this year  eMarketer thinks that share will be a tenth of global retail sales 
Ecommerce sales in Asia will account for 14 7  of total retail sales  with China contributing more than half  followed by Japan with slowing growth rates and then India  which will be the fastest growing  Volumes will double by 2021 
This year  ecommerce will account for only 8 8  of total retail sales in Western Europe  but grow to 11 4  by 2021  Germany is the top retail market but the UK the leading ecommerce region 
A global discussion is important for the sector because the Internet continues to melt away national barriers  making it ever easier to target overseas customers through established platforms 
So the social buying behavior of the Chinese and their increasing preference for luxury brands is relevant for U S  players  as is Alibaba s growing dominance in Asia  The Indian opportunity is also not to be ignored  as witnessed in Alibaba s recent investments  Amazon s aggressive growth plans and Walmart s acquisition of a controlling stake in leading local player Flipkart 
A closer look at these markets shows a bigger  more mature and sophisticated Chinese market and a faster growing Indian market offering greater scope for innovation 
China
According to Forrester  China will remain the biggest ecommerce market in the next few years generating 9X the size of the Japanese market and 17X the size of the South Korean market by 2020 
China made up 67 1  of mcommerce sales worldwide in 2017  83  of Asia Pacific sales   driven by its mobile first internet audience  Sales are expected to nearly triple from  909 93 billion to  2 595 trillion between 2017 and 2021 
With the digital revolution in China  many Chinese have multiple devices they use to research a product or shop on  Virtual reality  VR  has started playing a bigger role  taking consumers from the  VR caf   experience they enjoyed in 2016 to devices enabling the experience  Moreover  all the big ecommerce companies like Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Tencent and LeEco will continue to invest heavily in VR this year 
Cross border trade is another driver  as Chinese youngsters are extremely brand conscious and like to buy foreign goods  especially if they re from the U S   South Korea or Japan and especially in categories like food  dairy  personal care and beauty  But local brands are increasingly capturing mind share  especially in electronics and mobile phones  The Chinese Ministry of Commerce says that cross border transaction value will make up 20  of total Chinese foreign business and continue to grow at over 30  a year 
The Ministry also sees a growing number of Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities coming online with only 10 6 million of the estimated 159 9 million new users between 2015 and 2018 coming from Tier 1 cities 
India
According to a joint study by The Associated Chambers of Commerce   Industry of India  ASSOCHAM  and Deloitte  the digital commerce market in India will expand to over  50 billion in 2018 from  38 5 billion in 2017 
Last year was a strong one for the market  helped by mobile device adoption and 3G  4G  Wi Fi and high speed broadband technologies In 2017  82  of shopping queries were made through mobile devices compared to 76  in 2016 with one out of three customers in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities transacting through mobiles 
The apparel segment grew the strongest at 72   followed by food items at 65   electronic items at 63   beauty and personal care products at 52  and home furnishings at 49   Moreover  28  of regular shoppers were in the 18 25 age group with 42  in the 26 35 group  28  in the 36 45 group and 2  in the age group of 45 60  65  of Online Shoppers are male as against 35  female 
eMarketer reported that India s demonetization of the rupee in late 2016 had a greater than expected impact on consumer spending  so retail sales grew 11 8  in 2017 
Europe
Western Europe  particularly the UK does a lot of shopping online although the rest of Europe is slower to catch up  As such  most of the opportunity is in this region  Amazon is the leading player  eBay also has a relatively strong presence and there are some strong local players as well 
Latin America
FocusEconomics estimates that online sales in the region will grow 19  between 2016 and 2021  compared to the global average of 11   with total sales value touching  118 billion at the end of the period  However  the number of online shoppers is expected to increase substantially in the next three years  with the average revenue per user growing from  275 to  330 
Internet penetration in the region remains low  of which the number of people doing online transactions is also low  in the mid twenties percentage range   That s because there are significant challenges to doing business in the region  including logistics issues  traffic  inadequate infrastructure and limited banking facilities 
To top it all  there is stiff competition from a large number of local players  the foremost of which is Mercadolibre  which has operations in 18 markets and 50 million  unique visitors  While it is still the favorite in the region  growth prospects have drawn global players like Amazon  Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Alibaba 
The biggest markets are Argentina  Brazil and Mexico 
North America
Being one of the most mature ecommerce markets  the technological assistance in shopping transactions is at an advanced stage  So online transactions take place not only on desktop and mobile devices  but also through smart speaker systems like Amazon s Echo and Google s Home  People are also making the most of a host of omnichannel facilities including order online and pickup at store  shop in store and accept delivery at home  in car delivery  lockers  smart and secure entry systems  the Amazon Go concept store and more 
Warehouse robotics are on the rise  and AR supported mobile shopping apps are entering the market  With plenty of work remaining to be done  innovation continues in areas like payments  selection  delivery  logistics and loyalty  The use of artificial intelligence is gaining prominence  not only inside new age chatbots for customer care and other sales operations but also as part of the algorithm driving search results 
In this context  the fine line between advertising and buying continues to fade with advertisers looking to close sales quicker and pushing for better measurability of their campaigns  With Amazon entering the advertising business  this process is likely to be precipitated 
Overall  most market watchers agree that the intent to buy on Amazon is higher than on Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Shopping and at least half of product searches now start on Amazon  That doesn t necessarily mean that Google Shopping is a write off 
For one thing  Amazon generally pushes sellers to lower prices  so it may not always be the best place to generate premium sales or protect the brand image  Second  Amazon doesn t drive traffic to the seller s site  so it may not always be satisfactory for big brands  Third  the need to sell online especially given the competition from Amazon  is increasing demand for Google Shopping and driving up prices 
Today  for instance  advertisers may be willing to pay up to 10x the amount they paid for the same placement 5 years ago  These factors in combination generally make Google Shopping more suitable for big brands and sellers because they re the ones that can pay what is required for the visibility 
Government data indicates that retail ecommerce has outpaced total retail sales growth in recent times even in bad quarters for the sector  Some of this is on account of the continued shift from offline to online retail  as customers  baby boomers  move to online channels  But it s also because new consumers  millennials  often start out on online channels 
These consumers spend more time in a connected  social environment and take for granted many of the online tools previous generations struggled to understand  appreciate and adopt  Therefore  ecommerce will likely continue to outpace total retail sales in the foreseeable future 

Ecommerce Industry at a Glance
The following diagrams seek to define the broad spectrum of companies primarily dependent on the Internet for the distribution of their goods and services  as well as companies that enable these exchanges

Therefore the Zacks Industry Rank is a good indicator of investment opportunities within an industry at any given time  Moreover  because stocks in the same X industry have certain common positive or negative factors affecting them  it has been observed that there is some positive correlation between them

122044,343559,AKAM,Facebook Roundup  Shareholder Meet  Teen Trouble  Watch   More,opinion,"Facebook   NASDAQ FB   shareholders were proved powerless at the annual meeting  a Pew teen survey showed that teens continue to move away from the platform  exclusive news content for Watch appears to be on the way even as fresh regulatory issues made headlines last week 
Facebook Shareholder Meeting
All eight Facebook director nominees were elected at its annual meeting  while all six shareholder proposals were rejected 
Voting tallies show that a whopping 83  of outside votes were cast in favor of changing the voting system wherein Zuckerberg controls around 60  of the voting rights  Support for Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg was low at around 65   It s obvious that investors  both big and small  are unhappy with the way the company is being run  but the voting structure prevents them from taking any corrective action 
Facebook s management opposed all the shareholder proposals  so given Zuckerberg s control over the company  it was easy to reject them 
The shareholder proposals involved reporting on  fake news  controversies  closing gender pay gaps  adopting responsible tax principles  establishing a board committee on risk management and two proposals that would in effect have Facebook adopting simple majority voting at shareholder meetings 
Norges Bank Investment Management  which runs the world s largest sovereign wealth fund  backed all six shareholder proposals  Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services backed five of the six proposals  while advising against appointment of five Facebook directors including Zuckerberg  Vanguard Group Inc and Fidelity Investments didn t comment on their votes 
Facebook earlier said that it had adopted the Rooney Rule to bring diversity to its board 
Teens Continue to Dump Facebook
A Pew Research survey of 750 teens during a one month period this spring indicates that Facebook s popularity with teens continues to decline  Pew said that there are more options today than there were a few years back  which could be partly responsible for the decline 
And in case you re wondering if this is a backlash from the privacy problems at the social network that also isn t true  The survey showed that teens generally have a positive feeling about the impact of social media with a third of them saying it was good for society and 44  staying neutral 
The survey also included YouTube in the mix this time  which wasn t considered back in 2015 when the last such survey took place 
Around 95  of teens have access to a smartphone and 45  are practically always online  So it must be at least a little disheartening for Facebook that 85  of teens said they use YouTube  ahead of 72  for Facebook s Instagram  69  for Snapchat  51  for Facebook  down from 71  in the 2015 survey  and 32  for Twitter 
Moreover  when asked which apps they used most often  Snapchat topped the list at 35   followed by YouTube with 32  and Instagram 15   Only 10  said they used Facebook most often and 3  chose Twitter  Acquiring Instagram does appear to have been a solid decision 
The survey also showed that around 97  of boys and 83  of girls are now gamers 
Facebook Watch Developments
Facebook is on the verge of acquiring exclusive news shows from a number of providers including Fox News and CNN for its video focused Watch platform that officially launched last summer 
Now  people familiar with the matter are saying that the Fox show will be hosted by Shepard Smith  but further details aren t available  Group Nine Media s Now This is expected to start shows later this year  Talks are also on with News Corp s Dow Jones   Co   BuzzFeed and digital media company ATTN 
News shows from trusted players might take some of the heat off Facebook for allowing fake news to proliferate on the platform

Facebook got on the wrong side of New Zealand s Privacy Commissioner John Edwards after it refused to comply with an order to submit data relating to certain individuals  Facebook at the time said that the country was subject to Irish laws on privacy and local laws wouldn t apply 
Later  Facebook changed its terms of service and said that U S  laws would apply to the country along with international markets  since the company was domiciled in the U S  New Zealand is now rewriting its own privacy laws  so Facebook can be forced to comply 
Papua New Guinea Banning Facebook
Papua New Guinea  the island nation near Australia  is shutting down Facebook for a month to study the impact of the social network on its people and crack down on the fake accounts  false news and other information that is free flowing across the platform  Since the Internet penetration is reportedly very low at around 12   there is unlikely to be a huge impact 
Trending Feature Scrapped
Facebook has finally decided to scrap the trending news feature that has been a source of embarrassment for the company  Initially rolled out to help users quickly find interesting content that their friends and contacts might also be interested in  the feature has at times promoted 9 11 conspiracy theories  a false story about then Fox News host Megyn Kelly  and a parody news article about magical iPhone features 
Facebook has also been pulled up for promoting a certain political viewpoint through the feature  Moreover  getting rid of human curators only worsened the problem  So it s good to say goodbye

122086,343601,AKAM,Strong E Commerce Growth Means Big Earnings For Web Services,opinion,"According to the most recent annual release by the U S  Commerce Department  e commerce in 2017 was the strongest on record and also represented the strongest year over year growth since 2011 
Consumers spent approximately  453 billion on online retail purchases in 2017  an increase of 16  over 2016  itself a record year  13  of all retail sales are now internet transactions 

As existing retailers increasingly work to move sales and advertising away from brick and mortar enterprise to more efficient online platforms and new internet only entrants strive to gain market share online  the market for web services to support online operations has been growing at a furious pace 
The World Leader
Internet sales pioneer Amazon    realized way back in 2002 that their massive infrastructure could be scaled and sold as a service to other companies as an economical way to run their own web businesses  Writing proprietary software and maintaining huge amount of costly and power hungry hardware in a server farm is a daunting task for smaller retailers  but adding incremental capacity is relatively easy for Amazon 
Amazon has since added thousands of non commercial customers to its huge list of merchants 
By 2015  Amazon Web Services had more than a million active customers  including 2 000 government agencies  5 000 educational institutions and 17 500 nonprofits 
Web services accounted for  17B in sales in 2017  approximately 10  of total revenue of  177B   Sales in 2018 for Web Services are expected to be in excess of  20B 
Aided by the out performance of AWS  Amazon reported a blowout Q1 2018  earning  3 27 share versus analyst estimates of  1 22 share   16 upward revisions since then have the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2018 at  12 10 share  up from  8 49 share just 30 days ago and earning AMZN a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  

The Cloud Champion
Akamai    operates in a slightly different sub sector of Web services  providing a content delivery network to its customers that handles approximately 2 trillion transactions per day   The company has seen strong demand for inline media and entertainment options over the internet  much of which passes through Akamai s 200 000 servers in 1 400 networks around the globe 
Akamai is also positioned to take advantage of the growing popularity of streaming services to mobile devices as end users increasingly expect high quality content to be delivered over mobile data networks   
Cyber Security sales are also on the rise as companies seek to address concerns about the security of cloud computing and employ more and more sophisticated measure to combat hackers and data theft  requiring ever growing computational capacity  In Q1  Akamai reported revenue of  669M  an 11  increase over the same quarter in 207  but revenue from Cloud Security Solutions grew at 36  year over year   

During its Analyst conference call  Akamai raised guidance for 2018 revenues to a range of  2 69B to  2 72B and earnings to between  3 15 share and  3 25 share   Analysts are even slightly more optimistic and the Zacks Consensus Earnings estimate now stand at  3 27 share  Akamai is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  This week s list contains the first five below to get you started early  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as the calendar turns to March sees the equity markets again looked weak only to finish with a strong Friday  like February 9th 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue to consolidate in a broad range while Crude Oil may pause in its short term downtrend  The US Dollar Index continues to consolidate sideways while US Treasuries are consolidating after their move lower  The Shanghai Composite is biased to the downside short term and Emerging Markets look to tighten their broad consolidation at the recent top 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts showed big moves lower this week and then strength on Friday suggesting a possible reversal  The weekly charts are not as optimistic with red candles at lower highs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

122200,343715,AKAM,Initial Coin Offering  Gladius  Mercury Protocol  Nuggets,opinion,"Gladius Project  USA 
Gladius is a hi tech project that uses Blockchain to protect web resources from DDoS attacks  which resulted in  150 billion losses in 2016 only  This solution is a network designed for the analysis and automatic filtration of suspicious activities directed at web resources  Any computer with high speed Internet connection can serve as a Gladius network node and use its free computing power to process requests 
The system is based on Ethereum and the Content Distribution Network  CDN   inside which the system s particular nodes can exchange data without significant delays  Gladius  layout makes it possible to shift the traditional approach to DDoS attack prevention to the decentralized network and  thus  to considerably reduce the cost of standard SaaP services  including the giants Cloudfare and Akamai  NASDAQ AKAM   the total capitalization is some  15 billion  
Users obtain Gladius  own tokens  GLA   which serve as the system s internal currency  for every processed request  The Gladius system includes an internal trading venue to exchange GLA tokens and computing powers under natural competitive conditions  Therefore  websites can spend their tokens to use protection services and to speed up access to content by means of the geographically distributed CDN systems  As for computing power owners  they can monetize their assets 
The company is now carrying out a limited pre sale of GLA tokens  The pre sale will last until the opening of the main round  to be launched on November 1  2017  The HardCap of the project is  12 5 millions  its SoftCap is  2 million 
There are some sound arguments in favor of Gladius  including its being a great idea  numerous publications and a new approach to solving the existing problem  However  the project has one point of contention  Our team always pays close attention to the product s team  Gladius s team consists of very young founders who have recently graduated from university  On one side  this can turn out to be one of the project s strengths  just think how young the founders of Facebook  NASDAQ FB  or Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  are    On the other side  it remains unclear whether the team will be able to cope with big challenges on their way to the implementation of such sophisticated technologies 
Our team decided to conduct another investigation before making up its mind about investing in this project 
2  Mercury Protocol Project  USA 
Merculry Protocol is a set of smart contracts designed to create a more secure private social network that will develop and function using Blockchain instead of isolating the network on centralized servers  The creation of a symbolic social ecosystem will enable apps to use tokens to stimulate significant interactions  and users will be able to use them to get access to premium services  Mercury Protocol based apps can charge GMT tokens for premium services  inter platform message exchange and content  message encryption  support of large files  increased service life of messages  content mailing to the target audience using demographic benchmark data and more   Apps can also award GMT tokens to active users for their participation 
Dust Messenger will be the first app to use the Mercury protocol  According to White Paper  over 20 000 users use it and send 200 000 messages daily  Compared to 5 000 000 messages sent daily in July 2015  the apps seems to be in decline  According to App Annie  Dust ranked 500th in American social networks for iOS App Store 
Mercury Protocol has been developed by Radical App International  and its team comprises 15 people  Mark Cuban  a billionaire  is the project s investor and counselor  according to some information 
In summary  it appears that the instant messaging app industry is thriving  Facebook bought WhatsApp for  19 billion in 2014  Snap  NYSE SNAP   also has a market capitalization of  19 billion as of October 16  2017  Should Mercury Protocol be a success  it has every chance to grow  However  the market is highly competitive and packed  so most users are unlikely to use another instant messaging app if none of their friends uses it  Besides  its uses are relatively limited compared to Status  its nearest rival  Status  functionality includes a dApps launch  sending of payments and storage of cryptocurrency which cannot be supported by Mercury protocol 
The team overall decision is not to in the project at this stage 
3  Nuggets Project  UK 
This project deserves close attention due to its promotion by Argon Group  the world leader in counselling services on token based digital assets markets  Their past projects include Civic  Storj  Salt and Blockchain Capital  all of which gathered maximum crowd sales within hours 
Nuggets is a consumer blockchain platform giving users a single biometric tool for login  payment and identity verification  without sharing or storing private data  In this way  even Nuggets will have no access to your information  Nugget gives consumers a possibility to manage your personal information and protect companies from risks and expenses related to the control and protection of huge databases containing their clients  records  The project intends to deal with one of the major present day business problems  cyber security 
Imagine  you fill in all your personal information just once when signing up for the mobile app   your passport or driving license  payment details and make a selfie  That s it   now you are an approved user and your encrypted data is stored in Blockchain  From now on  you ll just have to apply your finger to the sensor on your cell phone  even when working on your PC  and you ll be able to enter any website requiring identification  to purchase goods in a store or to confirm your identity when communicating with the support service  It s easy and quick 
A total of 10 billion ERC20 NUG tokens will be issued on Ethereum blockchain  The pre sale and the ICO start on October 24  2017 and on November 14  2017 respectively  The project s Hard cap is  50 million  The platform itself is to be launched in the first quarter of 2018 
The cost of NUG tokens will grow as retailers add authorization via Nuggets and as the number of users increases in the ecosystem  Besides  users will be able to pay for services and goods with NUG tokens 
The project s team of developers is worth mentioning too  It comprises specialists who have worked with the world s leading brands  They have considerable professional experience of product development and commercialization  marketing  advertising  telecommunications and financial services 
Overall  the project is this highly promising and worth participating ",2017-10-19,Viktor Shpakovsky,https://www.investing.com/analysis/initial-coin-offerings-analysis-gladius-mercury-protocol-nuggets-200219793,200219793

122240,343755,AKAM,MasTec  Akamai Technologies  Daimler  Bayerische Motoren Werke And Volvo AB Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 15  2017    MasTec  NYSE   NYSE MTZ       as the Bull of the Day  Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ   NASDAQ AKAM       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis onDaimler AG  DE DAIGn  OTCMKTS   OTC DDAIF        Bayerische Motoren Werke  AG   OTCMKTS      and Volvo AB  OTCMKTS      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   MasTec  NYSE     is a  3 3 billion engineering and construction  E C  company specializing in energy and telecom sector projects  Another strong quarterly report and raised guidance has put the stock in the upper echelon of the Zacks Rank once again MasTec delivered a 60  EPS beat generated by much higher than expected volumes of Oil   Gas work and strong execution  The company also spoke very positively about their pipeline work for 2018  with a higher backlog than it had at this time last year Management increased full year guidance to  6 0 billion in revenues from  5 7 billion previously  and adjusted EPS to  2 73 from  2 45  There was some  pull forward  for the Q2 beat as some of the Rover Pipeline project in West Virginia was recently given the all clear by WV environmental authorities again But as analysts at investment bank Stifel Nicolaus noted  the company now has open spread capacity that it could potentially fill in 4Q  This would represent potential upside to our forecast   The bank raised its EPS estimates and their price target on MasTec from  53 to  55 50 As estimates stand right now  MasTec looks poised to grow the top line by over 16  this year and the bottom one by 45   Next year s revenues are projected to grow by 6  to  6 35 billion A Great Year  Muted Expectations for the Next OneOne investor concern might be that EPS estimates have not risen as dramatically for next year  currently showing a flat performance in the Zacks consensus  But this is most likely an effect of the relative uncertainty surrounding many of these major energy projects which represent 40 45  of MTZ business A generally positive market in telecom E C projects from major builders like AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon also encourages analysts about the MasTech outlook But it s the energy sector that keeps them talking right now  FBR Capital raised their price target on MTZ to  66 from  57 this month  Here s what StreetInsider com reported   FBR Capital analyst  Alex Rygiel  reiterated his Outperform rating on MTZ shares and raised his price target to  66 from  57 after the company posted exceptional 2Q results  The analyst believes backlog continues to provide good visibility and is expected to grow through the rest of the year The analyst believes the Oil   Gas segment will be particularly strong through year end but management is even more positive on the 2018 outlook due to the current backlog  pipeline of projects and solid industry drivers across all of its segments  Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ       the  8 billion provider of cloud data and video delivery storage solutions  has once again fallen into the cellar of the Zacks Rank as EPS estimates are lowered by Wall Street analysts My colleague Brian Bolan wrote about this situation back in late March when shares were trading  63   Here is the reason for this stock  that normally beats the number  to be the Bear of the Day  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has slid from  2 48 in June 2016 to  2 31 in October and recently slipped to  2 20 in March  That is not what investors want to see The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate has also seen estimates trimmed  as they moved from  3 37 to  2 76 to  2 53 over the same time horizon When estimates fall by 20  over several months  the PE must expand for the stock to hold its current price  That is exactly what has been happening for AKAM  end of March 27 Bear of the Day excerpt We ve seen two quarterly updates from Akamai since that report from Brian and things have continued south with the full year 2017 EPS consensus slipping in the last 60 days from  1 96 to  1 86 That s right  In late March  AKAM s consensus profit projection was for  2 20 and 60 days ago it had already fallen to  1 96 This is the trend that weighs on the shares and created a new 52 week low in late July at  45 41 And this also illustrates the power of the Zacks Rank to identify earnings momentum trends that become either bullish or bearish for stocks Meanwhile  2018 full year estimates have dropped from  2 15 to  2 01 in the past 60 days  Recall that in March the 2018 consensus was still calling for  2 53 This is a brutal decline in the profit outlook that has manifested itself in the share price and valuation If you are thinking about catching this falling knife  you might want to wait until there are signs that the earnings picture is turning around  The Zacks Rank will let you know as it  catches the turn  in analyst forecasts Additional content Wilbur Ross Sets NAFTA Menu  Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead  a big event occurs on Wednesday night  North American Free Trade

this way    The Trump administration has framed their NAFTA negotiating objectives around reducing the trade deficit with Mexico  If they don t touch autos  there s no way of getting at what they want  Among tools U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer may seek to boost U S  auto employment is strengthening the rules of origin to shut out more parts from Asia  He could also seek an unprecedented U S  specific content requirement for Mexican vehicles The auto industry is opposed to such a carve out  or to increasing the percentage of a vehicle s value that must come from the region above the current 62 5   This is already the highest of any global trade bloc The automakers say this would raise costs and disrupt a complex supply chain that sees parts crisscrossing NAFTA borders and has made North American car production competitive with Asia and Europe If U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gets his way  it would be harder to reach the 62 5  content threshold because the  tracing list  of parts that count towards that goal would be modernized He argues the current rules are too loose and allow a tariff free  back door  for Chinese auto parts Top Zacks  1 Rank

122267,343782,AKAM,Akamai Technologies  CEO Is Buying Stock  Should You ,opinion,"Akamai Technologies  Nasdaq NASDAQ AKAM  is the world s largest content delivery network  CDN  provider for media and software delivery related solutions  Generally  the company engages in services to make the Internet fast  reliable and secure 
Shares of Akamai Technologies have trended lower after the company beat both its Q1 17 earnings and revenue estimates but offered disappointing Q2 17 guidance  This clearly disappointed investors as the stock has since lost over 20  of its value  However  the sharp selloff of AKAM shares may have created an opportunity for investors 
As Warren Buffett stated in his    be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful  Here s why value investors may want to be greedy as it relates to Akamai Technologies 
A High Growth Industry
Technology strategist Michael Wolf predicts that internet access providers will see their revenues grow at an average rate of 6 3  a year from 2016 to 2021  via the  
Media consumption across the globe is increasingly prevalent in digital formats  The increase in the number of devices capable of supporting digital media along with faster internet speed  has provided consumers with an option to access media content from anywhere  Simply put  anyone with a smart phone can catch up on news  entertainment or their social activity anytime and virtually anywhere 
Media consumption in the US has shown  and has seen a significant jump away from traditional media to new  digital  media  More and more media consumption is happening on digital formats and people also spend more time on digital media as compared to traditional media  This industry tailwind is a very positive sign for shares of Akamai Technologies 
A Sharp Sell Off
The company beat its Q1 17 revenue estimate by  4 5 million and per share earnings estimate by  0 02  However  management warned investors that Q2 17 revenues would likely fall short of estimates by  20 million 
The weak Q2 guidance was a disappointing surprise and  as expected  the stock dropped  But shares dropped in excess of 16  which appears to be an overreaction especially when revenues and earnings are still growing 
Source  Furthermore  the company s margins are fairly stable  has a cash heavy balance sheet  generates strong cash flows and has a long term growth story that looks promising 
Akamai Transitions Toward More Profitable Security Market
Akamai s cloud security sales increased 44  in 2016 and show no signs of slowing down  Content delivery revenue dropped 10   but the company seems quiet comfortable with its new entry into the security market 
This is likely because the cloud security market is anticipated to expand at a  from 2015 to 2022 The security focused future looks bright for the AKAM shares 
Two Major Catalysts Driving AKAM Shares
The continued shift from linear TV to internet TV  Over the top  OTT  video consumption is performance sensitive  especially when dealing with high definition and or live streaming  This will help increase demand for AKAM s high quality offerings 
The shift in the gaming world towards augmented reality or virtual reality also creates demand for AKAM solutions as these services are also performance sensitive 
In both the media and gaming industries  the major product categories are moving towards performance sensitive mediums  AKAM is able to differentiate itself through quality which will help stimulate demand and ultimately growth 
Strong Financials
AKAM s cash flows are strong and have been strong since 2007  Although the company s EBITDA and Net Profit margins have trended slightly lower over the last few years  free cash flow margins have improved Source  AKAM s margins and returns are also very impressive when compared to its peers and the sector average as illustrated below

Akamai is likely to benefit from the rising demand for cloud infrastructure solutions  security  mobile products and online video  It is also likely to benefit from its strong foothold in the web applications domain  Additionally  the company has been re evaluating its growth strategy  which is a positive for the long run

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock now or on a move over 78 40  with a stop at 76  A straight stock buy 

Trade Idea 2  Buy the May 29 Expiry 78 Calls  offered at 62 cents late Friday   Defined risk for a short term trade 

Trade Idea 3  Buy the June 75 77 5 bull Risk Reversal   1 20   A leveraged trade for upside participation  with risk below 75 

Trade Idea 4  Buy the June 77 5 80 Call Spread Risk Reversal selling the June 75 Put  40 cents   Lowers cost of trade  3 but caps the upside  Still better than 6 1 reward to risk ratio 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the unofficial start of summer sees the equity markets looking positive and better in the longer timeframe than the shorter one 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to hold near 1200 while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US dollar Index is biased to the upside but it is still too soon to declare a reversal higher while US Treasuries are biased lower but showing signs of consolidation  The Shanghai Composite is moving higher in renewed strength and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside in the uptrend  debating whether it is a bull flag or a reversal 

Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ    Their charts agree with that on the weekly timeframe  but show better strength on the SPY and QQQ on the daily timeframe than in the IWM  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

122401,343916,AKAM,VIX Languishes As Stocks Fight Resistance,opinion,Volume has elevated somewhat this week  as Wednesday saw more trading volume than we have seen since the beginning of the month likely due to the release of the FOMC minutes  both in anticipation and aftermath   In any case  equity holders have been loath to sell  Mild intraday weakness continues to be met with buying You would think that any whiff of a disappointing economic report would send stocks plummeting  but instead  markets have held their psychologically important support levels of Dow 13 000  Nasdaq 3 000  S P 500 1400  and Russell 2000 800 without much trouble Some market observers are suggesting that the worse the news the better in that economic weakness will lead to another round of Fed stimulus  QE3   and that this emboldens the bulls in a contrarian way  But I don t think severe economic weakness is really what investors want  What has encouraged bulls is an economy that is holding up okay  just not recovering as fast as we need  and perhaps lacking in confidence  both business and consumer   In such an environment  a little stimulus is likely on the horizon Wednesday s release of the FOMC meeting minutes revealed serious discussion of a possible QE3  and the initial reaction to this at 11 00 ET was a market spike  about 8 points in the S P 500   Rather than requiring that things get really bad before acting  additional stimulus likely would be employed  fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery   We ll see what Chairman Bernanke has to say at the annual monetary policy conference next week in Jackson Hole  Then  the next FOMC meeting takes place September 12 13 In any case  global investors are putting up a more confident front  Pull up charts of European equities and 10 year bond yields in at risk places like Spain and Italy  Yields are falling through the uptrend line that had been forming since March as bondholders appear to be feeling more confident about repayment  while stocks are forming bullish patterns for many of the same reasons It seems that U S  stocks are hanging around awaiting a spark to light their fire  Perhaps it will be QE3  or perhaps a breakthrough with Europe s debt situation  However  let s be aware that September and October can be notoriously volatile and the impending U S  presidential election may add some fuel  as well One quick comment about the polarizing rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail  Unfortunately  the past tells us that no matter who wins the election  the other side likely will be as obstructive as possible in preventing any bold initiatives from passing  much less succeeding Contrast this approach with private life  In a marriage  if one spouse constantly seeks to undermine the other  the marriage will collapse  Likewise  in a business  divergent opinions are welcomed and explored  often vigorously   but once a strategic direction is decided upon  everyone must get onboard to work together or it surely will lead to failure of the business in a competitive marketplace  Only in a representative democracy can one side get away with openly trying to undermine the other s initiatives The reason  of course  is that cooperating with the party in power might help them to actually succeed  heaven forbid    which lessens the likelihood of the cooperating party winning the next election  In a business  failure of one party means failure of all  and cooperation is imperative  Blatant attempts to undermine will get you fired  Only in government will you see one side freely admit that their number one objective is to ensure the failure of the other party s initiatives with no repercussions Now  back to the markets  From a technical standpoint  many market observers continue to insist that we are way overdue for at least a minor correction to this nearly month long unabated uptrend  Looking at the SPY chart  it closed Wednesday at 141 82 after trading above 143 on Tuesday to hit new 52 week highs  It has been trading within a bullish rising channel for about 3 months SPY is still dealing with technical resistance from the convergence of the top of the rising channel and the April May highs  and in fact it has been forming a mini rising channel within the larger rising channel for the past couple of weeks  The 50 day simple moving average has crossed up bullishly through the 100 day SMA  Price still sits comfortably above the 20   50   100  and 200 day SMAs Some technicians are warning of a triple top sell signal  and others are saying the prior gaps  identified by the arrows  likely will be filled  which may take SPY back down to test 134  But there is a lot of support between here and there  including the rising 50 day SMA  the bottom of the larger rising channel  and the 100 day SMA  As I said last week  bulls just need more volume to break out of this pattern  although further consolidation of the oscillators  e g   RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic  would be healthy The VIX  CBOE Market Volatility Index a k a   fear gauge   has bounced slightly after hitting a 3 year low last week  closing Wednesday at 15 11  Still  there s not much evidence of investor anxiety that might be expected given the tenuous global economic situation By the way  I periodically point out that Sabrient subsidiary Gradient Analytics  which produces in depth forensic accounting research  has been particularly successful at rooting out firms with questionable earnings quality and revenue recognition practices  Let me also point that Gradient is also pretty good at identifying positive trends For example  Coventry Health Care  CVH   NVIDIA  NVDA   Six Flags Entertainment  SIX   Tempur Pedic  TPX   KeyCorp  KEY   DISH Network  DISH   Emerson Electric  EMR   and City National  CYN  have performed particularly well after encouraging trends were identified mostly options exercise and hold activities among top brass  in which they are preparing for long term capital gains treatment on anticipated gains   but also favorable earnings quality trends Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF   High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend   As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions   Observations  1  Technology  IYW  remains in the top spot with an Outlook score of 75  Stocks within IYW are displaying relatively low forward P Es  strong projected long term growth  and solid return ratios  Healthcare  IYH  falls to 68 this week  but retains second place  while Financial  IYF  stays in third  Industrial  IYJ  moves back up into fourth place   2  Overall  Wall Street analysts seem to have let up on their incessant lowering of earnings estimates  In particular  they have come back to the defense of Consumer Services  IYC  companies  as many of the earnings reports in the sector have been pretty good  Also  Utilities  IDU  continues to be well supported by Wall Street  although the flipside is that long term growth projections are still low  as you might expect for this sector  I think the rankings can be categorized as cautiously bullish this week  as IYJ  IYC  and Basic Materials  IYM  have all seen their scores improve   3  Telecom  IYZ  stays at the bottom of the Outlook rankings this week with a dismal Outlook score of 10  Stocks within the sector suddenly got a slew of downgrades from Wall Street  They also are held back by the highest forward P E and the worst return ratios  Basic Materials  IYM  is in the bottom two with a score of 34  It continues to be hampered by cuts in Wall Street s earnings estimates  although it has improved markedly   but still reflects the lowest  best  forward P E   4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 64  Utilities  IDU  is still by far the weakest on strong days  scoring 37  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged   5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  remains the investor favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 57  but this is substantially lower than it has been  For a long time IDU has scored in the 60s and sometimes as high as 70  Energy  IYE   which has by far the highest Bull score  has been abandoned  relatively speaking  by investors during market weakness  as reflected by its low Bear score of 42  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to sell off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best   6  Overall  Technology  IYW  again shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 177  Telecom  IYZ  is the worst at 105  As for Bull Bear combination  Utilities  IDU  is now the worst at 94  trailed closely by IYZ and IYH at 95  while Industrial  IYJ  is the best with 107   These scores represent the view that the Technology and Healthcare sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   Top ranked stocks within Technology and Healthcare sectors include Akamai Technologies  AKAM   AOL Inc  AOL   Cynosure  CYNO   and Amgen  AMGN    Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned   About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a one month forward look   Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods   Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions   Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors   About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias   However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs  such as the ones I identify above ,2012-08-23,Scott
