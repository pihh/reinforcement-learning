32190,253705,CALM,Bears Flock To Cal Maine Foods Before Earnings,opinion,"Egg producer Cal Maine Foods Inc  NASDAQ CALM  is up 0 6  at  39 32 this afternoon  with the long term underperformer set to snap its two day losing streak  History suggests the stock could be in store for more downside after the company s fiscal fourth quarter  earnings  slated for release before the market opens this Monday  July 22  Below  we will take a look at how CALM has been faring on the charts  as well as what the options market is pricing in for the stock s post earnings move 
As alluded to above  CALM has struggled to gain ground over the past year  Despite multiple breakout attempts  the 160 day moving average has been a stiff ceiling for the shares and has helped usher the equity to a roughly 14  year over year deficit 

Looking at the food concern s earnings history  the stock has closed lower the day after earnings in six of the past eight quarters    including a 3  decline in April and a 6 8  drop in October  Over the past two years  the shares have swung an average of 3 8  the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 6 3  swing for Monday s trading 
Near term options traders are unusually put skewed on Cal Maine stock  according to its Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 3 57  which ranks in the 93rd annual percentile  The August 40 and 42 50 puts are home to heavy open interest  and data from Trade Alert points to buy to open activity here 

The skepticism toward Cal Maine Foods has grown outside of the options pits  too  Short interest grew 7 1  during the most recent reporting period  and now accounts for 19 4  of the stock s total available float  At the security s average pace of trading  it would take shorts a full week to buy back their bearish bets ",2019-07-21,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bears-flock-to-calmaine-foods-before-earnings-200442268,200442268

32284,253799,CALM,SUPERVALU  SVU  Stock Grapples With Multiple Headwinds,opinion,"Grocery retailer SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   seems to be in a state of doldrums at the moment  The company  which has seen its stock price plunge 16 6  over the past one month and nearly 31 6  on a year to date basis  carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  today  What s going on with this consumer staples stock  Let s find out 
What s Wrong with SVU 
The grocery business is highly competitive and fragmented  Thus  as more companies are entering into the fray as well as expanding their presence  it is becoming tough for the existing players to retain their market share  Further  deflationary environment in food products and depleting footfalls at the supermarkets are causes of concern for these grocery chains 
SUPERVALU even announced a guidance cut for its EBITDA for fiscal 2017  The supermarket chain now anticipates EBITDA to decline 5  year over year  compared to a dip of 1 5  anticipated previously SUPERVALU INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   SUPERVALU cited lower than expected sales in the Retail and Save A Lot segments in second quarter fiscal 2017 as the reason for its soft guidance  Higher competition in the grocery business as well as a challenging sales and retail environment led to the decline in sales in the retail business of the company  Moreover  the Save A Lot segment is impacted negatively due to deflationary environment as well as unfavorable comparisons with the previous year 
The cumulative effect of these factors is expected to affect the top line in second half fiscal 2017  The company also anticipates the comparable sales in the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter 
Following the subdued outlook  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been trending downwards  underscoring the negative sentiment among analysts covering the stock  Evidently  the estimate for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has dropped 3 0  and 4 3  to 65 cents and 66 cents  respectively over the past 7 days 
Apart from this  SUPERVALU is experiencing lower revenues due to declining fees from the company s Transition Services Agreements  TSAs  with Albertson s LLC and New Albertson s  Inc  which may result in lower profits in the future  Further  pharmacy headwinds as a result of lower managed care reimbursement rates may put pressure on margins   
Bottom Line
As a prudent investment strategy advises one to exit underperforming stocks at the right juncture  we suggest you to do the same with SUPERVALU  before it burns a hole in your portfolio 
Nonetheless  one can count on better ranked stocks like Cal Maine Foods  Inc    NASDAQ CALM    The Kraft Heinz Co    NASDAQ KHC   and Ingredion Inc    NYSE INGR    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

32301,253816,CALM,Tyson Set To Grow Even As Soft Consumer Staples Halts Rally,opinion,"The optimism portrayed by Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN   at the Consumer Staples Conference  was offset by disappointing ISM manufacturing report along with lower service sector index  reading and soft jobs data in August  Investors were not very excited about the sector which is why the share price of the company did not rally even after the Springdale  AR based meat processor stated that the company is on a growth trajectory  In fact share price declined 3 3  after the company reaffirmed its view on Sep 8  2016 
In the conference held on Sep 8  2016  Tyson Foods reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2016 which was provided at the time of the announcement of its second quarter results  wherein both the top and bottom lines grew year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company expects its earnings per share to be 40  higher year over year and achieve a four year compound annual growth rate of approximately 22    Read   
Tyson also stated that it returns cash to its shareholders via share buybacks and dividends  Last year in November  this leading food processor announced a 50  quarterly dividend hike to 15 cents per share  The company also expects to raise the annual dividend beginning fiscal 2017 by 10 cents per year 
 TYSON FOODS A Price

   The company anticipates each of its operating segment to operate above its normalized range  Domestic chicken production is expected to go up  although fed cattle and hog supplies are estimated to remain short even in fiscal 2017  However  the company expects the prepared foods segment to benefit from operational improvements and positive pricing 
Tyson is also focused to grow its Core 9 categories   Tyson  Jimmy Dean  Hillshire Farm  BallPark  Wright  Aidells and State Fairbrands  Volumes are expected to rise 4  for the Core 9 categories of the company during fiscal 2016 on the back of significant market share gains 
Tyson s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  with a  of  A  and expected long term earnings growth rate of 11  makes it an attractive investment opportunity  We believe that Tyson continuously innovates and adds new products to the already rich food line up  Management has put a lot of focus on innovation which is an important part of their growth strategy

32312,253827,CALM,Sysco  SYY   5 Reasons To Add The Stock To Your Portfolio Now,opinion,"The Q2 earnings season is almost over across the sectors  While majority of the companies posted better than expected results with respect to both earnings and revenues  earnings declined on a year over year basis  Notably  this was the fifth quarter in a row to display a declining trend in earnings 
Though we witnessed strong jobs report for July  a jump in new home sales and a surge in durable goods orders  investors have become jittery after Brexit  which shook the global economy in Jun 2016  Further  the uncertainty surrounding the interest rate hike by the Fed has made investors cautious about the stock market  Given these macroeconomic uncertainties  investors are predictably resorting to safe haven stocks  In such a scenario  the consumer staples sector might be quite reliable 
Consumer Staples Provides Stability
The consumer staple sector fared well in the second quarter of 2016  Lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence did the trick for the stocks in this space  In fact  it should be kept in mind that the consumer staples sector has the potential to face the headwinds stemming  from continued Federal Reserve uncertainty  global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market SYSCO CORP Price and Consensus
    Let us focus on one consumer staples stock   Sysco Corp    NYSE SYY     which can be a good choice for investors  amid global issues 
Why is Sysco a Good Choice 
Low Beta Stock  Sysco has a beta of 0 61  A stock with less than 1 beta suggests that the price movement is not highly correlated with the market  Being less volatile than the market  they are safer bets at the moment 
Rank and Estimates  Five out of six estimates for Sysco   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock   have moved north for 2016 over the past 30 days 
Quarterly Results  Sysco s fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while revenues marginally missed the same  Results may have been impacted by Brexit uncertainties and currency woes  The company s focus on acquisitions and margin improvement probably resulted in the earnings beat 
Earnings increased double digits on the back of expense management and improved margins  Revenues grew 10  on a year over year basis  as volume growth was offset by unfavorable currency 
Expense Management Initiatives to Reduce Costs  Sysco is targeting at least  500 million in annual operating income growth by 2018  It also intends to grow earnings per share faster than operating income  The company stated that this operating income growth will be driven by a reduction in administrative costs  It has already eliminated about  700 million in annual costs over the past three years  In Mar 2016  Sysco announced the layoff of approximately 2  of its workforce  which translates to around 1 200 positions  over the next 15 months  which would help in reducing costs  Further  the company aims to increase deliveries to local  independent restaurants amid heightened competition 
Strategic Acquisitions  Sysco has been undertaking various acquisitions over the years to expand its distribution network and customer base  and boost long term growth 
On Jul 7  Sysco completed the  3 1 billion acquisition of London based Brakes Group  which will expand the global food product maker s footprint in Europe  Moreover  the acquisition is expected to be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by low to mid single digits in fiscal 2017  with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond  On Jul 5  Sysco announced the acquisition of an innovative e commerce platform  Supplies on the Fly  This platform will allow Sysco customers to place orders for more than 170 000 products online or by telephone  In Feb 2016  Sysco agreed to acquire North Star Seafood  which distributes high quality fresh and frozen seafood to a combination of local  wholesale  cruise  export and retail customers throughout Florida 
Last year  Sysco acquired 50  stake in Mexico based Pacific Star Foodservice  which provided it with access to distribution centers where the latter is the leading distributor  The company also announced the acquisition of Tannis Trading in Canada  which will allow it to expand sales in Canada  In Sep 2015  Sysco s wholly owned subsidiary  Guest Supply acquired Gilchrist   Soames  one of the leading luxury personal care amenity providers  which has a solid customer base in the hospitality industry  The acquisition of Gilchrist   Soames  renowned brands not only complemented Guest Supply s products  but also expanded its luxury personal care offerings for hotels  resorts and spas

32314,253829,CALM,5 Low Risk Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been performing really well among most product categories over the past few months  on the back of improving economy  Further  lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence are doing the trick for these stocks  Moreover  amid global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market  the consumer staples sector   normally defensive in nature   appears quite reliable for risk averse investors 
Consumer Confidence Surges
Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   surged during the month of August  indicating that the economy is on the recovery path after portraying a dismal show during the first half of the year  Still lower gasoline prices and a strong labor market have helped increase household wealth  which eventually boosted consumer spending 
In August  consumer confidence surged to its highest level in 11 months  The  index increased 4 4 points to 101 1  well above the expected level of 97 4 
In fact  there is enough evidence that the economic picture is likely to rebound in the third quarter  owing to improved residential construction and strong labor market conditions 
The Winning Strategy
Investing in the consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature  However  the economy has still not recovered from Brexit aftershocks  the Federal Reserve s still pending decision over the rate hike and other global growth issues  Though experts believe the economy is reviving  but low risk investors should be very careful about their strategy 
A time tested way to earn stable returns in the face of prevailing economic conditions is to invest in low beta stocks that pay high dividend yields and have an attractive Zacks Rank  Before we handpick the right stocks  let us delve a little deeper into the parameters for the selection 
Our Screening Metrics
Beta  one of the most commonly used appraisal measures of a stock s volatility  measures the tendency of a stock s returns to respond to market swings  For example  the market as a whole has a beta of 1  Therefore  a stock with a beta of less than 1 is less volatile compared to the entire market  while a stock with a beta higher than 1 is more volatile 
Low correlation stocks provide protection during turbulent times as they are less prone to day to day fluctuations 
The other parameter  dividend yield  assesses the amount of income received in proportion to the share price  Amid the current volatility  it could be a smart strategy to buy stocks that yield good dividends  thus ensuring a steady income 
Thus  based on a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   a beta of less than 0 8  and dividend yields of more than 2   we have zeroed in on five stocks that have bright prospects to ride out the impending volatility

32318,253833,CALM,Shares in Cal Maine eggs fall 4  after earnings  revenues miss,news,"Investing com    Shares in  Cal Maine Foods  Inc  O CALM  tumbled more than 4  in after hours trading after the Southern egg company failed to meet analysts  expectation with its earnings and sales during its second quarter of Fiscal Year 2016  
Cal Maine  a Mississippi based fresh egg producer  saw its shares decline after Wednesday s regular session in spite of relatively strong results over its last quarter  For the three month period ending in late October  Cal Maine sold more than 264 million eggs  as customers staged a mass exodus from several main rivals amid a widespread avian flu outbreak  which affected large portions of farms throughout the Midwest  The resulting supply cuts sent egg prices soaring more than 40  per cartons of a dozen earlier this fall  
Cal Maine reaped the benefits  as prices for its shell eggs jumped nearly 43  for the quarter  while its overall sales surged by 44 2  to  546 million for the period  At the same time  the Jackson  Mississippi egg producer incurred increased expenses related to stricter monitoring of its chicken to ensure that its flock had not been affected with the infectious strain  
 Our industry continues to deal with the significant reduction in the national laying hen flock that occurred this past spring related to the Avian Influenza  AI  outbreaks in the upper Midwestern United States  While the supply is gradually starting to move back up  the current national laying hen flock reported by the USDA yesterday is still approximately 9  lower than it was a year ago   Cal Maine CEO Dolph Baker said in a statement   Egg prices have moved lower than expected in spite of the reduced supply  and we expect prices will remain volatile until the industry has more clarity on future supply levels  
 While there have been no further reported U S  outbreaks of highly pathogenic AI  we continue to closely monitor the situation  and we are working with egg industry associations and government officials to identify ways to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks  There have been no positive tests for AI at any of the Cal Maine Foods locations  however  we have strengthened our biosecurity measures at all of our facilities   Baker added  
Cal Maine reported net earnings of  109 2 million or 2 26 per share  more than triple its earnings of  36 6 million or 0 76 per share over the same quarter in 2014  Still  the company fell short of analysts  expectations of  552 3 million in revenues on per share earnings of 2 40  
Cal Maine s Board of Directors also authorized a dividend of 0 751 per share to Class A common stockholders of record on January 27  The dividend will be payable on Feb  11

32319,253834,CALM,Wall Street fluctuates after worrisome data and while waiting for Yellen,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks were flat in mixed trade after data released on Monday increased concerns over economic growth stateside and as investors awaited the Fed chair Janet Yellen s scheduled appearance on Tuesday and any hints she might provide for the future of U S  monetary policy 
At 15 49GMT or 11 49AM ET  the Dow 30 inched up 13 points  or 0 07   while the S P 500 edged forward 2 points  or 0 08   and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite slipped 2 points  or 0 047  
While personal spending inched up by a seasonally adjusted 0 1  last month  matching expectations  the increase for January was revised down to a paltry gain of 0 1  from a previously reported rise of 0 5  
Personal income  for its part  rose by a seasonally adjusted 0 2   above forecasts for a 0 1  gain and after rising 0 5  a month earlier 
The meager increase in personal outlays last month  coupled with the prior month s downward revision  prompted the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to slash its forecast for U S  GDP growth in the first quarter to 0 6   from the prior estimate of 1 4  
As the Atlanta Fed explained  the forecast for real consumer spending growth in the first quarter was reduced to 1 8   from the prior 2 5   due to the report from the U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis 
The core PCE price index inched up 0 1  last month  below expectations for a gain of 0 2  and after rising 0 3  in January  while the core PCE price index rose at an annualized rate of 1 7   missing estimates for 1 8  and after a 1 7  gain a month earlier 
The core PCE readings are often considered to be the Fed s favorite measure of inflation and the lack of movement may support the dovish argument for the U S  central bank to hold off on the path of policy tightening 
Indeed  the dollar showed weakness after the data with the US dollar index  which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals  slipping 0 30  to 95 88 
In more positive economic data  pending home sales in the U S  bounced back in February from the prior month s decline  reaching a seven month high  The 3 5  increase handily beat consensus expectations for a gain of just 1 0  
Meanwhile  oil prices were unable to maintain gains and lost around 1  on Monday despite data released last Thursday  prior to the long holiday weekend  from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes showing that the the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U S  fell by 15 last week to 372 
Experts continue to be wary that a meeting of OPEC and non OPEC oil producers on April 17 will be able to achieve a meaningful impact to reduce the global supply glut with some market watchers going so far as to doubt if the meeting will even take place 
Furthermore   Barclays   LON BARC  warned on Monday about the recent rally and suggested that an unwinding of long positions could push oil back down to near  30 
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 0 63  to  39 21 a barrel by 15 50GMT or 11 50AM ET  while Brent oil fell 0 85  to  40 68

Price chart for the November  57 50 call

Rolling Down to the  57 50 November Call Option
Rolling down ten days prior to contract expiration allowed us to generate a higher premium than the cost to close   1 40 versus  0 80  and afford us some downside protection  This is an excellent example of how we should always be prepared with a secondary exit strategy plan  rolling down  if our initial plan   hitting a double   cannot be implemented

Discussion
After entering our option selling trades we must immediately enter into  position management mode  Most of the time exit strategy execution will not be necessary but when it is  it is imperative we take advantage of these opportunities  In the case of CALM for the November contracts  we used covered call writing  our 20  guideline and then the rolling down strategy to turn a share loss of  3 25 per share into a net position gain of  2 08 per share  Mastering all three of the required skills  stock selection  option selection and position management  is what sets Blue Collar Investors apart from all the other option sellers

32417,253932,CALM,Delta  Theta  And The Impact On Our Covered Call And Put Selling,opinion,"The  play a major role in both covered call writing and selling cash secured puts  Understanding these factors and tailoring our strategy based on this insight will allow us to elevate our returns to the highest possible levels  In today s article  we will focus in on Delta and Theta and discuss when they are an asset or a liability in our investment positions  We will also examine how to best take advantage of mastering this information 
Definitions
Delta  The amount an option value will change for every  1 00 change in the price of a stock  Deltas range from 0 to 1 for calls and 0 to    1 for puts 
Theta  The amount the theoretical value of an option will change with the passage of one calendar day  all other factors remaining the same  Theta is a negative number for both calls and puts 
Theta  Asset or liability 
Once we ve established our position  Theta is our friend  Once we execute the option selling trade  Theta goes to work eroding the time value of the option  much like buying a car and pulling it out of the show room parking lot and boom it goes down in value  This is a positive for us  because we may want to take advantage of an exit strategy opportunity and buy back the option  Because of Theta  we may be able to sell high and buy low 
Theta also teaches us to sell our options early in the contract to capture as much premium as possible  Most of us sell monthlys  options with 1 month expirations   so our obligation is only four or five trading weeks depending on the contract month  So while Theta is assisting us  Delta is weighing in as well  and Delta may also be our friend but it could also turn against us 
Delta  Asset or liability 
For both covered call writing and selling cash secured puts  we are okay if share price rises  Puts will not be exercised and calls  if exercised  will result in sale of our shares at a price we felt was favorable to us when we entered the trade  Plus we can always  if we want to retain our shares  Our main position concern is share value deterioration  When selling calls  we start to lose money when share value declines more than the option premium received from the short call  For put selling  the option may be exercised and the shares  put  to us at a higher price than current market value  leaving us in an unrealized losing position  Both of these scenarios assume no exit strategy intervention  But  as we all know  exit strategies are crucial to our success  so we may benefit from buying back the short options  To visualize the impact Delta has on option value  let s first look at a price chart for Cal Maine Foods  Inc   NASDAQ CALM  from 8 25 2015 to 11 25 2015 

CALM Price Chart from 8 25 2015 through 11 25 2015
Brown fields show share price decline which should decrease call premium value and increase put premium value
Yellow fields show increases in share price which should increase call premium value and decrease put premium value
With CALM trading at  60 00 near the start of the November contracts  October 16  2015   I focused in on the December  57 50 in the money calls and December  57 50 out of the money puts  My conservative positions were the result of an upcoming Fed meeting in December where interest rates may be hiked 
Price chart of the December  57 50 call option

CALM  December  57 50 Call Option
As price value declines  brown fields   our biggest concern  option value also declines  making it more cost effective to buy back an option if position management techniques are called for  If stock price rises  yellow fields  we have the choice of buying back the option or allowing assignment and selling our shares at a price we deemed favorable at the start of the trade 
Price chart of the December  57 50 put option

CALM  December  2015  57 50 put option
If share price rises  yellow fields   option value declines and we may be presented with an opportunity to close our position at virtually no cost and use the  freed up  cash to secure another put  a second income stream in the same month  if you will  If share price declines  brown fields  put option value will increase  making it more expensive to close out a potential losing situation  Now there are times we must do this to prevent substantial losses but there is one silver lining in these situations while Delta is rearing it s nasty face  Theta is helping us out by decreasing the time value of the put option each calendar day 
Discussion
Understanding the Greeks is critical to our success  Once we enter our option selling positions  Theta is generally our friend while Delta is Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde  When Delta represents an asset  we should know how and when to take advantage of it  and when it is our enemy when need to manage our trades and mitigate losses

32419,253934,CALM,Cal Maine  CALM   Moving Average Crossover Alert,opinion,"Cal Maine Foods  Inc    NASDAQ CALM   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for CALM broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 5 9  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CALM stock 
If that wasn t enough  Cal Maine isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  1 estimate has been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CALM ",2016-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cal-maine-(calm):-moving-average-crossover-alert-200130421,200130421
32420,253935,CALM,Should You Get Rid Of Cal Maine Foods  CALM  Now  ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Cal Maine Foods  Inc    NASDAQ CALM    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in CALM A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  7 01 a share a month ago to its current level of  6 37 Also  for the current quarter  Cal Maine Foods has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 17 cents a share from earnings of 48 cents over the past 30 days    The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 13 5  in the past month So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Diversified Food industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   B G Foods Inc    NYSE BGS    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be better selection at this time Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-06-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-get-rid-of-cal-maine-foods-(calm)-now-200133922,200133922
32427,253942,CALM,4 Stocks To Watch  FIVN  NADL  CALM  KMX,opinion,"Markets are coming down  they re breaking support  may be headed lower  oscillators are getting oversold  and so on  As a result of that  I am seeing some really good shorts as well as a few longs that are acting well  We will also go over a few ultra shorts that look good 
Five9 Inc  NASDAQ FIVN  has been acting great  up another 32 cents to 12 58  or 2 6   on 550 000 shares traded on Monday  It s in a nice rising channel  and the uptrend shows three waves up  I think it will get as high as 16 1 2 17 as a target  Then  if it pulls back down it can be at the support level at 12 58  It s at mid channel and has reached one of my targets  So  either it pulls back and consolidates  and then runs up  or it runs straight up and consolidates 
North Atlantic Drilling Ltd  NYSE NADL  is an interesting stock and is suddenly exploding  On Monday it was up 27 cents to 6 27  or 4 5   on 408 432 shares traded  This stock came down from 110 00 all the way down to 1 42  Now  in a 5 wave move  and the fifth wave could take it to 9 1 2 10  It has increased fourfold I look for momentum  Monday was an inside day  a positive day with good technicals  With 9 23 days to cover  we can get a squeeze  particularly if it runs above 7 00  It could take off and explode a point or two higher 
Cal Maine Foods Inc  NASDAQ CALM  broke down about a week ago  and just about every day since  On Monday it closed down 1 54 to 40 50  or 3 66   on 1 million shares  I could see this stock quickly in the 35 36 zone 
CarMax Inc   NYSE KMX  was put out as a swing on Monday because it broke the wedge to the downside  and was down 11 cents to 49 14  on 2 3 million shares  What I m looking for is whether it can take out the double bottom at 47 00  Once it does that  the targets are 44  41  and then maybe the mid to high 30 s

32477,253992,CALM,Sector Detector  Searching For Solid Support In Face Of Global Headwinds,opinion,"Uncertainty about the health of the global economy led investors to flee U S  equities during Q3  primarily driven by worries about China s growth prospects and the Federal Reserve s decision to not raise rates  Sure  there are plenty of real and perceived headwinds  but on balance it seems that a recession here at home is not in the cards  And when you consider sentiment and the technical picture  it appears that a continuation of Friday s bounce is in store  The question remains as to whether the seasonally strong Q4 will be able to propel the bulls through levels of resistance that have built up 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
On a total return basis  the S P 500 large caps fell  6  during Q3  and mid  and small cap stocks also struggled as then S P 400 and the S P 600 fell  8  and  9  during the quarter  respectively  Defensive strategies outperformed  and defensive sector Utilities held up the best  while Energy and Basic Materials struggled in the face of falling commodity prices 
Global headwinds are evident  particularly in China  but even our domestic data shows weakness  ISM manufacturing report last week was barely above 50  and New Orders and Backlogs are quite weak  And then the monthly employment report disappointed  Looking at the imminent Q3 earnings reports from among S P 500 companies  estimated earnings are expected to fall  4 7  quarter over quarter  the first decline since 3Q2009   while revenues are expected to fall  2 8  from last year  which would be the third quarter in a row with declines   The best reports are expected to come from Consumer Discretionary  Telecom  and Healthcare 
The numbers are growing among those forecasting either a recession or a bear market  or both  For example  Doubleline Capital s Jeffrey Gundlach thinks risk assets like stocks and junk bonds are quite vulnerable to the downside right now 
But on the other hand  household incomes and purchasing power are up  Median household income  adjusted for inflation  grew in August to a post recession high of nearly  56k  And jobless claims are at the lowest level since 1973 as layoffs  are few and far between  Auto sales are accelerating toward record levels  hitting an annualized rate of 18 2 million in September  which is near record levels  and the average new car price paid is about  31k  Global monetary policy remains accommodative    including in the U S     and it will remain so even if the Fed starts raising the fed funds rate  Banks are well capitalized  Corporate coffers are flush with cash  Homebuilders are doing well  with rising sales in both residential and commercial properties 
Nevertheless  with the focus on jobs numbers and inflation  fed funds futures are forecasting only a 31  chance of a quarter point rate hike in December  The 10 year yield closed Friday at 1 99   Put in context  its 52 week range is 1 65 2 49   The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NYSE TLT   rose more than 5  during Q3 
Even with recent bouts of market weakness  volatility has not been rising much  The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Friday at 20 94  which is barely above the 20 panic threshold  Some institutional portfolio managers see this as an indication of a continuation to the stock rally 
To be sure  bulls will need to muster the troops  bolster bullish conviction  and get some increased volume going in order to take stocks higher 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  NYSE SPY  closed Friday at 195  Of course  SPY remains well below its 200 day simple moving average  and the dreaded death cross remains intact  the 50 day SMA crossed down through 200 day in early September   But after some needed backing and filling and testing of support around 187  Friday s trading gave us a bullish engulfing candlestick  and indeed  Monday has brought a strong continuation to the upside  The 200 price level  corresponding to 2 000 on the S P 500  was tested for resistance three times  and it is likely we will soon see another retest  If bulls can break through  the 204 level  former support line for the long sideways consolidation from February through late August  is the next level of tough resistance  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are pointing up bullishly  If SPY can t break these resistance levels  we might see another retest of support at the August intraday low near 182  But in any case  I suspect the bulls will find a way to take this market higher by year end  Overall  the chart is shaping up a lot like 1998 and 2011 

Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking  while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1  Healthcare remains in the top spot this week with an Outlook score of 83  as the pullback in prices has boosted the forward P E to a little over 16x  down from 17x   Also  the sector shows net positive sentiment among Wall Street analysts  net revisions to earnings estimates   Even though the overall trend continues to be skewed toward reductions to forward estimates  a lack of cuts  even without a strong upside bias  earns a sector a good relative score  Forward long term growth rate and return ratios are also solid  Utilities has moved into second ahead of Technology holds the second spot with a score of 78 on the strength of the most positive sentiment among both Wall Street analysts and insiders  open market buying   as well as a reasonable forward P E  Technology  Financial  and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  round out the top five  followed by Industrial and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   Financial continues to display the lowest forward P E  less than 14x  
2  Energy remains at the bottom with an Outlook score of 3 as the sector scores among the worst in all factors of the GARP model across the board  In particular  the sector still shows an increasingly negative forward long term growth rate and low return ratios  as well as the highest forward P E  over 23x    However  note that the refining and marketing segment remains an area of strength within the sector  with some having forward P Es under 10x   Basic Materials takes the other spot in the bottom two with an Outlook score of 20  slightly worse than Telecom at 21   despite a low forward P E  under 15x  
3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy and Technology share the top score of 66  while Utilities is the lowest at 45  The top bottom spread has widened to 21 points  which reflects low sector correlations on particularly strong market days  which is good  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than broad risk on behavior  
4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the top score of 53  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  However  this score is down substantially from 73 several weeks ago  Basic Materials and Energy score the lowest at 36  as investors flee these sectors during market weakness  The top bottom spread is 17 points  which reflects relatively low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  which is good  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  rather than broad risk off behavior   so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5  Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Technology and Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical  are the best  although Consumer Services displays the better Bull Bear balance  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Basic Materials is the worst 
6  After giving signs of growing bullishness two weeks ago  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings appear to have a neutral bias again  with defensive sectors Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical  in the top five  along with all weather Healthcare and economically sensitive Technology and Financial  Notably  our Net Revisors score  which reflects the outlook among Wall Street analysts  continues to show very little in the way of positive earnings revisions  which is worrisome  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing  momentum  or relative strength factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   has reflected a defensive bias since August 20 and suggests holding Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be defensive from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is below both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs in SectorCast from the Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare sectors include PowerShares S P SmallCap Utilities ETF  NASDAQ PSCU   PowerShares S P Samll Cap Consumer Staples Portfolio  NASDAQ PSCC   and Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLV  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Utilities  Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and Healthcare sectors include Southwest Gas Corp  NYSE SWX   New Jersey Resources Corp  NYSE NJR   Cal Maine Foods  NASDAQ CALM   Snyder s Lance Inc  NASDAQ LNCE   Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE EW   and Cigna Corp  NYSE CI  
If you prefer to take a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Industrial  in that order  But if you prefer a neutral stance on the market  the model suggests holding Healthcare  Utilities  and Technology  in that order 
IMPORTANT NOTE   I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

32493,254008,CALM,CALM  Be Prepared For A Catalyst,opinion,"Eggs are not a perfect round sphere  They are oblong ellipses  But there is beauty in that shape  Symmetry of a simple ellipse no matter how you rotate it  Perhaps better than a sphere  Noticeable 
One company that sells eggs is Calmine  NASDAQ CALM   And it has that same symmetry in its chart of the stock price  The chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern building  This pattern looks for a move equal to the wide end of the triangle on a break out in either direction 

A 12 to 13  move  But which direction  That is the beauty of the pattern  You do not know and you do not care  The momentum indicators do not give a clue  The RSI is running along the mid line and the MACD is flat  Once it does break then you can just follow along with a long or short trade 
Be prepared  There is a catalyst as they report earnings December 23rd  but it looks like it may not wait that long
