127092,348607,ANF,Abercrombie   Fitch Is Ready to Abandon the Shopping Mall,news,"Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  is looking pretty buff these days  While the teen retailer isn t about to return to the days where shirtless models stood around in its doorways to entice customers in  it is flexing the retail equivalent of a beach body as it reported some of its strongest holiday results in years 
Wearing that newfound confidence  Abercrombie is warning shopping mall landlords that it has no qualms about kicking them to the curb if it needs to  It seems to be a veiled threat that if it doesn t win concessions on rent it will happily walk away when its leases expire 

A very merry Christmas
Abercrombie was able to achieve what it seems few other retailers were able to do this Christmas  post higher sales  It used the announcement to also reaffirm its guidance for the fourth quarter 
The retailer says it expects net sales to be between flat and up 2  for the quarter  comps to also be flat to up 2   versus a 3  increase last year  gross profits to be down 150 basis points from last year s 59 1  margin  and operating expense to be flat to up 2  
Most of the hits Abercrombie is suffering come from adverse currency exchange rates as well as the effect tariffs on Chinese goods would impose  The last round of tariff hikes hit apparel retail pretty hard 
A return to glory days
While CEO Fran Horowitz didn t release specific numbers about the holiday sales period results  she did say in a statement   We experienced record revenues in the U S  over Black Friday week  which includes the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday  with Hollister setting a new record and momentum at Abercrombie continuing to build  delivering its strongest topline in over five years  
The turnaround at Abercrombie is building to such a degree that she now expects the store to outperform its Hollister sister chain in comparable store sales  and for the U S  business to beat out international markets 
Last quarter both Abercrombie and the U S  segment saw higher comps than its own Hollister and international markets  respectively  and considering just how far down they had been  the change in fortunes seems truly remarkable 
Slimming down
And you can see it reflected in the comments of Abercrombie s CFO Scott Lipesky  who participated in a  fireside chat  at this week s ICR investment conference  where he threw down the veiled challenge to shopping mall operators   We re willing to walk away from any mall at this point  For us  it s about getting the right store in the right location at the right size  
Horowitz has previously stated that shrinking Abercrombie   Fitch s store footprint is her top priority at the moment  The retailer operates 677 stores in the U S   400 of which are Hollister and 277 are Abercrombie stores  It operates an additional combined 200 stores in international markets 
The CEO has already begun the process of winnowing down the retailer s flagship stores  closing locations last year in New York  Milan  and Fukuoka  Japan as their leases came due  It started 2019 with 19 flagship stores and hopes to exit 2020 with just 12  As Lipesky told the ICR conference   The customer has changed so dramatically  We don t have a need for these large stores long term  
The rest of its footprint is up for grabs too 
In the driver s seat
Every two years about half of the retailer s store leases come up for renewal  which should give Abercrombie   Fitch considerable leverage when dealing with its landlords  With a record number of store closings last year and the next wave of closings already beginning  the retailer may have more than a few mall operators open to listening 
Because consumers have changed their shopping habits  retailers have to react to those new preferences    and Abercrombie finally has  It updated its model  and e commerce now accounts for around 30  of sales  meaning it s not so dependent upon the mall 
Malls are also adapting to the new landscape  adding more restaurants and experiential opportunities to offset the retail vacancies  But after undergoing such pains to sculpt its beach body  Abercrombie   Fitch now wants to show it off  And malls will be willing to look ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/piwi7,2061190

127107,348622,ANF,JUUL Continues To Unravel As Altria s  MO  Q3 Earnings Near,opinion,"Altria   NYSE MO   is set to report its third quarter results on Thursday  October 31 before the opening bell  Altria has seen its shares decline over 6  in 2019 thus far  lagging behind the broader tobacco market s 9 2  run  JUUL Lab s troubles continued today as a management shakeup resulted in the resignation of several executives at the e cigarette company 
The unraveling at the executive level of JUUL comes just as Altria nears its third quarter report  which has many investors worried about the potential implications the e cig health scare will have on the quarterly report 
JUUL Continues to Tread Water 
The  12 8 billion investment Altria made in JUUL Labs for a 35  stake back in December has had investors uneasy ever since serious health concerns arose over the use of e cig products  The health concerns caused major retailers like Walmart   NYSE WMT    Kroger   NYSE KR    and Walgreens   NASDAQ WBA   to suspend its sales of electronic cigarette products 
The FDA is cracking down on e cigs as it proposes a ban of all flavored e liquids to discourage teens from using the devices  The headwinds facing Altria s investment in JUUL played a key role in Philip Morris International   NYSE PM   opting out of a potential merger with Altria 
The resignation of several JUUL executives comes as the latest setback for the battered electronic cigarette manufacturer  Several top executives went their sperate ways from the company  including Chief Administrative Officer Ashley Gould and Chief Financial Officer Tim Danaher  NYSE DHR   both veteran employees at the young start up 
Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers  former marketing executive at Gap   NYSE GPS   and Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF    also left the company as JUUL elected to suspend advertising  The onslaught of regulatory headwinds has also led to a major reorganization in the young company  It plans to cut 500 jobs  or about 10  to 15  of its total headcount  by the end of the year  Before the cuts  JUUL boasted about 4 100 employees 
Outlook 
As the regulatory obstacles mount for JUUL  Altria must now try to provide financial numbers that can quell the outcry from shareholders  In response  Altria has utilized the inelasticity of demand in tobacco products to hike its cigarette prices three times this year 
However  the tobacco giant will not reap the benefits of its third price hike in its Q3 report  but it will see the impact of the past two price increases  these two price raises helped the tobacco firm post top and bottom lines that grew on a Y Y basis in Q2
Our Q3 consensus estimates forecast the company s bottom line to jump 5 56  to  1 14 per share and for sales to tumble 0 22  to  5 28 billion  Smokeable shipment volumes are expected to fall 6 58  and smokeless shipment volumes are projected to slip 2 09   Wine shipments are expected to grow 3 4   Looking ahead to the firm s full fiscal 2019 figures  our estimates call for earnings to climb 5 01  to  4 19 per share and for sales to reach  19 72 billion for 0 48  leap 
Takeaway 
Altria s investment in JUUL continues to unravel before our own eyes as the onslaught of regulatory scrutiny continues to impact the young company s operations  JUUL is in complete rebuild mode as it makes the cuts necessary to completely restructure the business from the ground up  Bringing in new faces to the company as well as rebuilding the company to better appease the concerned public will be crucial to salvaging the battered start up  Altria sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Q3 Earnings   SalesAbercrombie reported earnings of 23 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents  Further  the bottom line declined 30 3  from adjusted earnings of 33 cents in the year ago quarter  In constant currency  adjusted earnings declined 14 8  year over year Abercrombie   Fitch Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Net sales totaled  863 5 million  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  870 million and were flat with the year ago quarter  On a constant currency basis  the top line rose 1   Sales included an  8 million impact of unfavorable currency Sales gained from a solid back to school period in August and continued momentum in October  partly negated by a challenging retail environment  resulting from unseasonably warm weather in September and ongoing disruptions in key international markets Brand wise  net sales were flat at  514 8 million for the Hollister brand  while it rose 1  to  348 7 million for Abercrombie  From a geographical viewpoint  net sales grew 4  in the United States  while dropped 6  in international markets Comps in DetailComparable sales  comps  remained flat against 3  growth in the year ago quarter  Brand wise  comps declined 2  for Hollister and improved 3  for Abercrombie Moreover  comps benefited from strong performance in the United States  owing to continued double digit growth in digital and positive traffic trends  Further  Hollister and Abercrombie brands witnessed positive comps in the United States  Notably  U S  comps improved 3  However  this was partly offset by an 8  decline in comps in international markets primarily due to escalating macro headwinds in key markets  The company is facing uncertainty related to Brexit  which continues to hurt sales in the U K    its largest international market  Additionally  ongoing protests in Europe and Asia  particularly in Hong Kong  are weighing on results  Also  extremely hot weather in Europe in late August and early September hurt sales for soft clothing and accessories Notably  Hollister has greater international presence compared with Abercrombie  Consequently  comps for the Hollister brand reflect the impacts of the aforementioned headwinds related to the international business MarginsGross margin contracted 120 basis points  bps  to 60 1   In constant currency  gross margin declined 80 bps  including 50 bps of impact from higher shrink losses as well as headwinds of 30 bps from increased average unit costs  AUC  Adjusted operating income of  25 million

capital expenditure Moreover  Abercrombie expects inventories to be up in low to mid single digits at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter  driven by tight inventory controls The company also bought back 412 000 shares in third quarter fiscal 2019 for nearly  6 million  With this  it repurchased about 4 million shares in the first nine months of fiscal 2019  At the end of the fiscal third quarter  Abercrombie had 4 6 million shares remaining under its current share repurchase authorization  In the first nine months of fiscal 2019  the company returned  102 5 million via share repurchases and

total to 70 new store experiences  It is currently on track to deliver about 85 new experiences in fiscal 2019 OutlookFor fiscal 2019  Abercrombie now estimates flat to 1  rise in sales  backed by comps growth and contributions from new stores  This will likely be offset by adverse impacts of currency of  40 million  of which  35 million was witnessed in the first nine months of fiscal 2019  Earlier  the company projected sales growth of flat to up 2  Further  it projects comps of flat to positive 1  versus flat to positive 2  mentioned earlier  It reported an improvement of 3  in the

China tariffs  Earlier  the company had projected gross margin decline of 50 90 bps It expects rise in operating expenses  excluding other operating income  of 2 3  from adjusted operating expenses of  2 03 billion reported in fiscal 2018  The view for operating expenses includes flagship store exit charges of  45 million incurred in the fiscal second quarter and asset impairment charges of  13 million incurred in the third quarter  Furthermore  it anticipates effective tax rate in the mid 20s Additionally  Abercrombie continues to envision capital expenditure of  200 million for fiscal 2019 For the fiscal fourth quarter  the company anticipates sales of flat to up 2  from the prior year quarter  This includes an adverse impact of nearly  5 million from negative currency translations  Meanwhile  it anticipates comps of flat to positive 2   whereas it reported a 3  increase in the year ago quarter The company expects a gross margin decline of 150 bps from the year ago quarter s reported level of 59 1   This will likely include adverse impacts of 70 bps from currency and China tariffs Abercrombie expects operating expenses  excluding other operating income  to remain flat or increase around 2  from adjusted operating expenses of  555 million reported in fourth quarter fiscal 2018  It anticipates effective tax rate in mid to upper 20s 3 Key Picks in the Retail SpaceBoot

2  API Inventories Due as Driving Season Gears Up
The American Petroleum Institute s petroleum data  which showed a surprise fifth straight build last week  will likely come under scrutiny on Wednesday  as the tug of war on oil prices between the ongoing U S  China trade war and escalating tensions in Middle East persist 
 The escalating trade war has helped pressure oil prices  yet tensions with Iran and attacks on oil tankers and other risks are keeping oil strong   said Phil Flynn at Price Futures in Chicago 
WTI crude rose 0 9   to settle at  59 14 a barrel Tuesday on expectations for reduced domestic supplies after flooding dented crude flow distributions from the main U S  storage hub in Cushing  Okla 
U S  oil prices could be set to add to gains in the near future in the wake of the start of the U S  driving season  which typically sees a rise in demand for fuel  generating bullish crude drawdowns 
Bob Yawger  director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA said that while concerns about the U S  China trade situation continue to linger  the summer driving season typically produces an  overwhelming spike in demand in the U S  and everywhere else  
 It looks like there could be some upside   Yawger added

127146,348661,ANF,Abercrombie  ANF  Q2 Loss Narrows  Stock Down On Tariff Woes,opinion,Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   incurred narrower than expected loss in second quarter fiscal 2019  However  it reported earnings in the prior year quarter  Moreover  the company s top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year  Further  management lowered sales view for fiscal 2019 The company assumes the impact of List 3 and List 4 tariffs should hurt near term results  These tariffs are likely to have an adverse impact of about  6 million on the company s cost of goods sold and gross profit in the current fiscal year In fiscal 2019  the company expects gross margin to decline 50 90 basis points  bps  from 60 2  recorded in fiscal 2018  The downside can be attributed to combined unfavorable impact of currency and expected tariffs of about 60 bps  For the fiscal third quarter  gross margin is likely decline nearly 100 bps from 61 3  reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  Currency headwinds and anticipated tariffs to the tune of 90 bps primarily resulted in the downturn Abercrombie expects merchandise imports from China in the current fiscal year to be less than 20   down from 25  last fiscal  Consequently  shares of the company slumped nearly 15  yesterday  In the past three months  the stock has lost 17 4  against the  s 4 8  growth Nevertheless  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company remains focused on achieving its long term targets through the execution of the transformation efforts  In the United States  Abercrombie witnessed a robust start to back to school and expects the momentum to continue in the second half of fiscal 2019 backed by strength in products and solid marketing efforts In a separate press release  Abercrombie declared two major appointments to direct its Europe  Middle East  and Africa  EMEA  and Asia Pacific  APAC  operations  Daniel Le Vesconte and Olga Wu are appointed as the Group Vice Presidents for the EMEA and APAC regions  respectively  These officials are likely to carry out the company s strategies and boost brands to aid growth in the corresponding local markets Q2 Earnings   SalesAbercrombie incurred loss of 48 cents per share in the second quarter  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 52 cents  In the year ago quarter  the company reported adjusted earnings of 6 cents  Bottom line results were hurt by the negative impact of flagship store exit expenses to the tune of 50 cents Abercrombie   Fitch Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Net sales totaled  841 1 million  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  854 million and dipped 0 2  from the year ago quarter s sales of  842 4 million  On a constant currency basis  the top line rose 1  Brand wise  net sales improved 1  to  504 8 million at Hollister  while it dipped 2  to  336 3 million at the Abercrombie brand  From a geographical viewpoint  net sales grew 2  in the United States while dropped 4  in international markets Notably  digital business continued to perform well backed by robust momentum across both brands and geographies  Also  digital channel sales improved in the double digit range during the quarter under review Comps in DetailComparable sales  comps  remained flat against 3  growth in the year ago quarter  This was backed by favorable cross channel traffic  compensated with lower conversion  Brand wise  comps remained flat for both Hollister and Abercrombie brands Moreover  comps benefited from strong performance in the United States  wherein the metric improved 2   This was partly offset by a 3  comps decline in international markets MarginsGross margin contracted 90 basis points  bps  to 59 3  on account of higher average unit costs  AUC  due to product mix and a marginal fall in average unit retail  AUR   Further  the metric was hurt by increased promotions and markdowns  given the highly promotional U S  retail environment Abercrombie incurred operating loss of  39 5 million compared to adjusted operating loss of  9 million in the prior year quarter  Adjusted operating loss margin contracted 580 bps and fell 530 bps on a currency neutral basis  Operating performance in the quarter was hurt by adjusted operating expenses to the tune of 470 bps owing to an unfavorable impact of 530 bps from the exit charges of flagship outlet Other FinancialsAbercrombie ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  499 8 million and gross borrowings under its term loan agreement of  253 3 million  As of Aug 3  2019  inventories amounted to  487 1 million  reflecting 7  growth from the prior year period  In the first six months of fiscal 2019  the company spent  94 2 million as capital expenditures Moreover  Abercrombie ended the fiscal second quarter with inventory up nearly 7  and expects the metric to grow low to mid single digits at the end of the fiscal third quarter The company also bought back about 3 5 shares in second quarter fiscal 2019  At the end of the fiscal second quarter  Abercrombie had nearly 5 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization  So far in fiscal 2019  it returned  84 2 million via share repurchases and dividends On Aug 22  the company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share on the Class A shares  This is payable on Sep 16  2019  to its shareholders of record as of Sep 6 Store UpdateAbercrombie has been closely working on its goals of optimizing store fleet  which resulted in significant store closures over the past eight years  The company takes these closures as an opportunity to improve store productivity by reducing store occupancy costs  Notably  the global store optimization is a key component of its efforts to deliver operating margin expansion and reach its goals for fiscal 2020 As part of its continued focus on optimizing store fleet  Abercrombie announced plans to close three additional flagships  Apparently  it shut down Hollister SoHo in the reported quarter  The other two are Milan A F that is expected to be closed by the end of fiscal 2019  and Fukuoka A F in fiscal 2020 Simultaneously  the company delivered 26 new store experiences in the reported quarter  It is currently on track to deliver about 85 new experiences in fiscal 2019 OutlookFor fiscal 2019  Abercrombie now estimates sales to be flat to up 2  backed by comps growth and contributions from new stores  This will be somewhat offset by adverse impacts of currency to the tune of roughly  45 million  of which  26 million is reflected in the first half results  Earlier  sales growth was projected in the band of 2 4  Further  comps are expected in the range of flat to positive 2  versus the earlier projection of growth in low single digits and 3  improvement in the year ago period Operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are now expected to increase nearly 2 3  from adjusted operating expenses of  2 03 billion in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior view of 4 5  increase  The increase mainly reflects flagship store exit charges of about  45 million incurred in the reported quarter  Furthermore  it anticipates effective tax rate to be in mid 20s Additionally  Abercrombie continues to envision capital expenditure of roughly  200 million for fiscal 2019 For the fiscal third quarter  the company anticipates sales to be up about 1  from the prior year quarter  This includes an adverse impact of nearly  10 million from negative currency translations  Meanwhile  comps are anticipated to remain flat Operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are estimated to increase 1 2  from adjusted operating expenses of  493 million in third quarter fiscal 2018  Excluding one time charges in the prior year quarter  adjusted operating expenses are likely to be flat to up 1   Effective tax rate is anticipated in mid to upper 20s 3 Key Picks in the Retail SpaceBoot Barn Holdings  Inc    NYSE BOOT   delivered average positive earnings surprise

U S  President Donald Trump will continue to hold talks with Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe early this week amid tensions over differences on trade  Trump is unhappy with Japan s large trade surplus and is considering slapping tariffs on its auto exports if a bilateral trade agreement is not reached 
On Friday  China will increase tariffs on  60 billion in U S  imports in retaliation for the U S  decision to hike duties on Chinese imports  escalating a trade war between the world s two largest economies that threatens to damage the global economy 
The trade war has widened into a battle over who controls global tech after the Trump administration banned U S  firms from doing business with Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei 
On Friday  Trump held out some hope that Huawei could be part of a trade deal  but unless further talks are announced investors will remain unconvinced 
2  EU election results
Voting in EU elections wraps up on Sunday and eurosceptic parties are forecast to do well  including in the three biggest countries of the euro zone  Germany  France and Italy

EU leaders are to hold talks in Brussels on Tuesday to start the process of appointing the next leaders of the EU institutions  including parliamentary  commission and council presidents

127178,348693,ANF,Abercrombie  ANF  Down 35  In 3 Months  Will It Bounce Back ,opinion,Shares of Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   have been losing sheen lately owing to the revised expense view for fiscal 2019 on account of adverse impacts from foreign currency and higher operating expenses  Soft view for the fiscal second quarter further raises concerns on the company s near term performance However  Abercrombie s surprise trend remains robust with eight straight quarters of positive earnings surprise and sales beat in eight out of the last nine quarters  Quarterly results gained from solid strategic efforts  comparable sales growth and robust digital business  Moreover  strategic capital investments  cost saving efforts  loyalty and marketing programs might help the company bring back its lost shine Factors Hurting Stock PerformanceFor the current fiscal year  operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are now expected to increase nearly 4 5   up from the prior view of a 2  rise  Increase in operating expenses mainly reflects net lease related charges of about  45 million  or 220 bps  due to the closure of the SoHo and Fukuoka flagships  For second quarter fiscal 2019  operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are estimated to increase 10  from adjusted operating expenses of  498 million in second quarter fiscal 2018  Also  adjusted operating expenses are likely to be flat to up 1  Additionally  the company issued soft sales and margin outlook for the fiscal second quarter  Management anticipates sales to be flat to up 2   down from 8  growth registered in second quarter fiscal 2018  Comps are anticipated to remain flat compared with an increase of 3  in the prior year quarter  Gross margin is likely to contract nearly 100 basis points from 60 2  reported in the year ago quarter  Lower gross margin will mainly stem from expectations of increased currency headwinds and promotional activity Meanwhile  Abercrombie s results are hurt by unfavorable foreign currency rates  which are likely to continue throughout the fiscal year  For fiscal 2019  adverse currency is expected to mar the top line by nearly  30 million  up from the prior view of  15 million impact  For the fiscal second quarter  it anticipates sales to be hurt by nearly  10 million due to currency translations Consequently  shares of Abercrombie have plunged 35 1  in the past three months  wider than the  s 15 2  decline Strategic Endeavors Might Help TurnaroundAbercrombie s strategic capital investments  cost saving efforts  loyalty and marketing programs are gaining traction  Moreover  the company has been making significant progress in expanding digital and omni channel capabilities  Its investments in mobile  omni channel and fulfillment have significantly provided a boost to its digital business  Notably  the digital business continued to perform well backed by robust momentum across Abercrombie s brands and geographies  In first quarter fiscal 2019  digital channel sales contributed 30  to revenues  Further  the company is progressing well on its goal of delivering integrated digital and in store shopping experiences As part of its store fleet optimization efforts  Abercrombie has made significant store closures over the last eight years  The company considers these closures as an opportunity to improve store productivity by reducing store occupancy costs  In fact  the global store optimization is a key component of the company s efforts to ensure operating margin expansion and achieve its goals for fiscal 2020  For the next two years  the company has identified lease expirations for nearly 50  of its store base in the United States  Simultaneously  it expects to consistently invest in the enhancement of store experiences  mainly through new store prototypes  remodeled stores and right sizes  In fiscal 2019  Abercrombie plans to deliver about 85 new experiences Bottom LineWhile these strategic efforts appear promising  the aforementioned hurdles cannot be ignored  Nevertheless  we expect Abercrombie s initiatives to offset these headwinds in the future Currently  Abercrombie carries a Zacks

127202,348717,ANF,Out of fashion  H M tests new store to get back in vogue,news,By Anna Ringstrom STOCKHOLM  Reuters    Step into one of the more than 4 300 H M  ST HMb  budget fashion stores around the world and you often know what to expect  clothes racks crammed with tops  trousers and skirts in a spartan and sometimes cluttered environment  H M executives say that s no longer good enough  Sales have stagnated for years  the company s shares have lost nearly two thirds of their value since 2015 and more nimble rivals have adapted faster to the rapidly shifting retail landscape  Now  at a spruced up pilot store in H M s home town of Stockholm  the chain founded in 1947 is testing new concepts that mark a break with its past   and partly echo some tactics already deployed by rivals to attract shoppers   The H M store in the upmarket Karlaplan neighborhood of the Swedish capital offers a smaller range of selected clothes  displayed on airy shelves and tables in color coordinated sections   as well as espressos and invitation only events  H M planned the layout and ranges with affluent local customers in mind  marking a shift from offering relatively standardized ranges across its stores to catering more for local tastes and means   It s an appealing store  visually  and also the range feels appealing to me  I m more inclined to head here first rather than to the other stores   said Josefin Klegard  38  sipping sparkling wine at an event for local loyalty club members with a pop up beauty parlor and H M designers talking about trends  In Karlaplan  there s a high concentration of clothes from H M s more upmarket lines such as  Trend  and  Premium Quality   which is usually only available online  H M s Swedish website sells  Premium Quality  leather coats for 3 499 crowns   397  while most H M coats are priced well below 1 000 crowns    We have to raise the entire quality level  to have fewer items in  a nicer presentation of the goods   said Chief Executive Karl Johan Persson  the grandson of H M s founder   That is a task  to be able to sell more with less  and to do that in a cost efficient way   he told Reuters  SLUGGISH SALES After decades of rapid expansion  H M had 4 801 stores in 69 countries at the end of May  making it the world s second biggest fashion retailer after Spain s  Inditex   MC ITX   which owns the Zara brand  But more than two years of sluggish sales had left H M with  4 1 billion of unsold stock  A recovery in sales in H M s third quarter suggests it might have stopped the rot  but analysts suspect the improvement was largely due to price cuts to shift stock  at the expense of profitability  Full third quarter figures are due on Sept  27  Majority owned by the founding Persson family  H M finally admitted in January it had a problem for a while with its H M branded stores  which make up the bulk of its business  Company executives admit they neglected the health of H M stores as they focused on building online sales and developing eight new  mostly higher end brands  such as COS and ARKET   even though the H M brand accounts for over 90 percent of sales  It was the crowds and clutter at H M s store in New York s Times Square  NYSE SQ  that turned off 21 year old student Nicole Archie  who now prefers online sites such as  Boohoo   L BOOH  or Fashion Nova   I remember the line being so long that I went to go sit on a bench near the shoes   she said   There were laces and strings all over the floor and tangled  If I wanted to purchase a shoe  I wouldn t be able to because everything was so

127203,348718,ANF,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow 
1  Fed Minutes Come After Powell s Dovish Speech
The market certainly treated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s speech today as a dovish tilt  raising the possibility of fewer interest rate hikes next year 
Tomorrow  investors will get the chance to parse the minutes of the last FOMC meeting for further signs the Fed is stepping away from its slow and steady hike plan 
The Fed kept its benchmark rate in a range of 2  to 2 25  at the conclusion of its two day policy meeting on Nov  8  but signaled a plan for further rate hikes in a bid to keep inflation in check  including three likely in 2019 
But Powell s comments that rates are currently just below neutral led equity investors to speculate that maybe just two more hikes could leave the Fed in the sweet spot 
Traders are currently pricing in a 40 5  chance of a fed funds range of 2 5  to 2 75  following the Fed s Oct  30  2019 meeting  higher than the day before  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  Those predicting rates hitting 2 75  to 3  declined from the previous day 
2  Inflation Data  Pending Home Sales Scheduled
On the economic calendar  the Fed s favorite inflation gauge  personal consumption expenditures  PCE   excluding food and energy  arrives before the opening bell 
Released with the October personal income and spending numbers at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT   the core PCE price index is expected to come in with a 0 2  rise for the month  an annual gain of 1 9   The Fed likes to target core PCE inflation below 2  
Spending and income are both forecast to rise 0 4  
At the same time  weekly initial jobless claims come out  with economists predicting a slight drop to 221 000 
At 10 AM ET  the National Association of Realtors will release the October figures on pending home sales  coming off disappointing new home sales data today 
On average  economists are looking for a rise of 0 8  for the month

127215,348730,ANF,Abercrombie Tanks   More Downside Risk Ahead,opinion,"Summary 

Abercrombie   Fitch Company  NYSE ANF  sank 27  on Wednesday after the company beat on earnings and sales but missed on guidance 
We believe there s more downside risk  as the stock has broken its cycle low relatively early in its current market cycle 

Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF  Stock Weekly Chart 
The company reported earnings per share of   0 29 and total revenue of  734 million  above analyst estimates of   0 43 and  733 million  However  management s guidance for the next quarter was for sales growth of only 2   below estimates of 2 8  
After confirming plans to close 3 large flagship stores  CEO Fran Horowitz painted an optimistic picture   What we ve learned from the consumer is they are really enjoying the smaller spaces  There s a more intimate feel and customers like one on one interaction  
Our view is that today s move represents a rupture in the current market cycle for ANF  It has now fallen below the point at which it started the cycle and done so early in the cycle and so will be in a bearish phase for a relatively long period of time  As such  we see continued risk into late August  with a target below  16 ",2019-05-30,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abercrombie-tanks-hard--cycles-point-to-more-pain-200426430,200426430

127317,348832,ANF,Trump Justice Department civil rights nominee denounces neo Nazis,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch
WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s nominee to lead the U S  Justice Department s Civil Rights Division denounced white hate groups on Wednesday and pledged to support the agency s investigation into the murder of a woman by a man believed to harbor Nazi sympathies 
In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Eric Dreiband called white supremacy groups  a disgrace  and said he was putting people  on notice  that if they commit racially motivated crimes  then the  Civil Rights Division is coming for them  
Last month s rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville  Virginia  has weighed heavily on the Trump administration in recent weeks  after Trump suggested that  both sides  were to blame for violence between the protesters and counter demonstrators 
His comments drew a sharp rebuke from both sides of the aisle in Congress 
More recently  Trump angered civil rights activists after he pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio  who was convicted of criminal contempt for defying a 2011 injunction that barred his deputies from racially profiling Latinos 
Dreiband told the committee   The bigotry and ideology of Neo Nazism  Nazism  white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan are a disgrace to this country and should be eradicated from the United States  
Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently announced the department was launching a civil rights investigation into the death of Heather Heyer  32  who died after witnesses saw James Alex Fields Jr  drive his car into a crowd of counter protesters 
Those who know Fields said the 20 year old Ohio man harbored white supremacist views  He already faces state charges in the incident 
 If confirmed  I will do everything I can to support the investigation   Dreiband told senators on Wednesday 
Multiple civil rights groups have strongly opposed Dreiband s nomination to head the Civil Rights Division as an assistant attorney general 
Dreiband  a partner at the law firm Jones Day  has represented companies in some high profile discrimination cases and has written several articles critical of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  EEOC  
Dreiband previously worked at both the EEOC and the Labor Department s Wage and Hour Division during the George W  Bush administration  He also served under Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
More recently  he represented retailer Abercrombie and Fitch  NYSE ANF  Co after it was sued by the EEOC for refusing to let a Muslim female job applicant observe her religion by wearing a head scarf 
The Supreme Court ruled 8 1 against the company in 2015 
Dreiband also represented R J  Reynolds Tobacco Co in a case last year involving a 49 year old job applicant who sued over age discrimination 
A divided U S  appeals court later sided with the company  finding it did not violate the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act by telling recruiters to hire workers just out of college 
In his testimony Wednesday  Dreiband stressed that he has represented a diverse array of clients  including a police shooting victim and another facing the death penalty ",2017-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-justice-department-civil-rights-nominee-denounces-neonazis-526130,526130

 The sole aim of investors  while designing their portfolio  is to generate handsome returns  However  with a huge number of stocks flooding the market at a particular point of time  the task is anything but simple  more so in the face of time constraints 
In fact  the stock market is not an easy place to master and one needs thorough knowledge to rake in profits  This is where some guidance comes in handy  To get proper guidance  investors often fall back on expert advice while arriving at their investment decision  buy  sell or hold   The experts in the field of investing are brokers as they have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  
Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them  They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Therefore  the opinion of brokers can act as a valuable guide for investors 
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Since brokers indulge in thorough research  the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise  Estimate revisions also serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  an increase in estimates normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa 
One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates  Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy 
Similarly  analysts might turn bearish and trim estimates  thereby downgrading a stock  following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Naturally  investors look to get rid of such stocks from their portfolio on the basis of broker advice 
Designing a Winning Portfolio
To take care of the performance with respect to the bottom line  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks 
While we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  The price sales ratio has been clubbed with the above criteria as it is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  making the strategy foolproof

outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed  With this  the company s earnings marked second straight beat  while sales lagged for the third straight time Following the quarterly earnings release  shares of the company decreased 9 4  in after market trading on Apr 10  Soft comparable sales  comps   which dipped roughly 1 4  mainly due to mid single digit decrease in sales from stores  were probably the reason for the decline  Moreover  soft comps impacted the company s overall sales  which fell short of the estimates and also declined year over year Nevertheless  robust sales at the company s customer facing digital networks partly offset the comps decline  Moreover  management issued an upbeat earnings outlook for fiscal 2019 Q4 in DetailBed Bath   Beyond reported

Estimate of  3 333 million  This downside can be primarily attributed to one less week in the fiscal fourth quarter versus the year ago period  Also  a shift in the calendar negatively impacted the

fall in the number of redemptions However  SG A expenses fell 6 3  to  933 7 million in the quarter  As a percentage of net sales  SG A increased 140 bps to 28 2  mainly owing to higher technology

127329,348844,ANF,Stock Exchange  Is It Time To Lever Up On Market Momentum  ,opinion,"The Stock Exchange is all about trading  Each week we do the following 
discuss an important issue for traders 
highlight several technical trading methods  including current ideas 
feature advice from top traders and writers  and
provide a few  minority  reactions from fundamental analysts 
We also have some fun  We welcome comments  links  and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders  If you have some ideas  please join in 
Review  You Risk How Much Per Trade 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question how much do you risk per trade  We noted that risk management is an important part of any trading program and that concentration can lead to great success  but also great disasters  We shared some suggestions on sizing and concluded with the importance of knowing your needs as well as balancing prudence and aggressiveness 
This Week  Is It Time To Lever Up On Market Momentum 
Speaking of aggressiveness  when times are good  such as the current bull market   using leverage  borrowed money  to trade can magnify positive results  But leverage also has historically been one of the key ingredients to major market blow ups throughout history  for example the housing crisis and Long Term Capital Management  to name a couple  
And despite our current strong market rally  the yield curve has recently flashed a warning sign in many investors  minds  In particular  long term rates have dipped below shorter term rates  which is often a signal of a recession on the near horizon 
However  according to Michael Strobaek  Global CIO at Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   we should be getting ready for an uptrend not a downturn  According to Strobaek 

 We estimate the probability of a recession in the U S  at less than 10  in the next 12 months  less than 20  in two years and just over 30  in three years  

And in perhaps some corroboration with Strobaek s view  trading psychologist Dr  Brett Steenbarger suggests that this market can still go higher  In particular  he shares data and stats on the historical likelihood that this rally continues  and also shares anecdotal evidence of more pent up buying power waiting on the sidelines  Specifically  he notes many frustrated traders have missed this year s rally   because they were waiting for a pullback before buying   and that 

  If the mood of participants that I speak with is indicative of a more general mood  any such pullback may find interest from frustrated traders late to the party  

And if you are in the bullish camp  thereby believing momentum can still carry this market significantly higher  is it time to lever up to magnify your potential returns 
As we ve discussed in the past  knowing when to get aggressive with your trades versus when to exhibit more  prudence  is an important art and science  as we discuss in the next section 
Model Performance 
Our trading programs were nudging us to move to almost entirely cash several months ago which worked out well in terms of actual client account performance  However  the models and trading programs have moved back to normal trading and cash levels  and they ve been performing well recently  thereby magnifying our stronger performance relative to the weaker performance when the programs held higher cash balances  And for the record  we are not using leverage  we re simply back to trading as usual 
And we are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models  as our readers have requested 

Controlling Risk 
We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
Since many clients combine the trading models with our long term fundamental methods  they have additional diversity of methods without the need for short term timing 
For more information about our trading models  and their specific trading processes   click through at the bottom of this post for more information  Also  readers are invited to write to main at newarc dot com for our free  brief description of how we created the Stock Exchange models 
Expert Picks From The Models 
Note  This week s Stock Exchange report is being moderated by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  This week I bought shares of Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF   It s a retail clothing brand  And for your information  I basically bought it on the dip  as you can see in the following chart 

Blue Harbinger  Interesting  Holmes  I know you are a technical trading program  not a human  and your strategy basically involves buying on the dip  You typically hold for around 6 weeks  Here is a look at some fundamental data for Abercrombie in the following FastGraph  although I already know you re into technical trading data  not buy and hold 

Holmes  You got that almost right  BH  Technically speaking  I am aware of a lot of  fundamental  data  I just use it differently 
BH  Thanks for sharing  Holmes  And how about you  Road Runner any trades to share with us this week 
Road Runner  I bought shares of Danaher Corp  DHR  this week  If you recall  I am a momentum trader  and I like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel 

BH  Interesting  I think your strategy is attractive given current market conditions  In particular  if you believe this market rally will continue  then technically speaking this type of trade should work well 

RR  It s a little more complicated than that  but thanks for the feedback  Anyway  how about you Felix anything to share this week 
Felix  I don t have any specific trades to share this week  but I do have a ranking to share  I am a momentum based technical trading model  and this week I ran the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones through my model  and I ve ranked the top 20 below 

BH  I actually like a lot of Dow Jones names right now  I keep thinking non Dow Jones type stocks have been relatively outperforming for so long that blue chip contrarian value ideas are due for a strong rally when market sentiment eventually changes 
Oscar  I have some ETF rankings to share as well  As our resident sector ETF rotation model  this week I ran our  Comprehensive   Diverse ETF Universe  through my model  and the top 20 are ranked in the following list  For example  the oil ETF United States Oil  USO  at the top of my list 

Conclusion 
When times are good  it can be tempting to use leverage to magnify returns  And while we don t do this in our own accounts  we do adjust the level of cash  depending on whether market conditions are conducive to our trading models  Knowing when to get aggressive  and when not to  is an important part of trading  The market is driven by fear and greed  and it may well be the case that there are still more fearful traders on the sidelines looking for an opportunity  for example  even a small market pullback  to re enter some trades that will thereby extend the current market rally even higher

New Albany  Ohio based Abercrombie defined teen apparel in the 1990s with its risqu  advertising and its large logo on apparel  but has been hit hard as a new generation of shoppers avoids heavy branding in favor of more independent style  In response  Abercrombie has attempted to reinvent itself  and dropped its logo in 2014  Abercrombie said on Monday it will focus on its surf wear brand Hollister  the one bright spot of growth for the company   Abercrombie also said it will  continue to refine and implement strategies to position the Abercrombie brand for revitalized performance  for its eponymous brand  which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014 ",2017-07-10,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/abercrombie-ends-talks-with-potential-buyers,-shares-slide-503816",503816
127350,348865,ANF,Fashion M A  like a crop top  is hard to pull off,news,"By Lauren Hirsch NEW YORK  Reuters    Mergers and acquisitions for fashion retailers are like a crop top t shirt  a risk best braved by a select few and avoided after a certain age  Abercrombie   Fitch Co  N ANF   the teen brand with a 125 year heritage  became the latest to demonstrate that on Monday  ending talks about a potential sale after failing to agree terms with potential suitors  Successful deals in the mercurial world of U S  fashion are rare  and now look even less likely to succeed as sales dip across the board  Cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design  and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor   As a result  established brands like Abercrombie are having problems finding a savior    Often  as well as spending the money to buy the brand or business  you then have to spend more to do something strategic that will propel growth  and that means paying out twice before getting a return   said Neil Saunders  managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail  Five of the 20 companies involved in the biggest private equity apparel deals of the last decade have been restructured or gone bankrupt  All struggled under the debt load of a leveraged buyout  The biggest acquisition  Apollo Global Management s roughly  3 1 billion leveraged buyout of Claire s Stores Inc  restructured in 2016   The second largest acquisition  J  Crew Group Inc  which TPG Capital and Leonard Green   Partners bought for about  3 billion  is now being restructured  Gymboree Corp filed for bankruptcy last month  seven years after Bain Capital s  1 8 billion purchase  MOUNTING PRESSURE Many U S  fashion bosses are finding they have no option but to consider a sale as pressure mounts from more affordable fast fashion chains from Europe such as Zara  MC ITX  and H M  ST HMb   and customers abandon malls in favor of Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  and other online retailers   Outerwear brand Eddie Bauer  for example  is exploring a sale while also seeking relief from its debt load  sources have told Reuters  Teen brand American Apparel explored a sale last year before ultimately filing for bankruptcy   As Abercrombie s experience shows  finding a willing buyer at the right price is difficult    Public company board members are reticent about green lighting large scale mergers and acquisitions because it s hard to find a good example of a business that has been rewarded by the equity market for doing so   said Rohit Singh  who specializes in retail at UBS Investment Bank  not speaking specifically about Abercrombie  Struggling retailers are a tough sell to potential acquirers  Merging with another company risks double the trouble   more brands falling flat and more stores bereft of customers   Most fashion retailers are locked into store leases  and as landlords watch their malls empty out  they are increasingly unwilling to give their tenants and easy path out   Perhaps the reason the Abercrombie deal didn t get done was that they ve got way too many stores in way too many malls that don t make any money  and the cost to unwind those pieces and get out of those stores is just too great to compensate for the upside   said Mark Belford  a retail specialist at KPMG Corporate Finance   After failing to strike a deal  Abercrombie now has no choice but to go it alone  On Monday  the New Albany  Ohio based retailer said it will focus on its growing surf wear brand Hollister and try to reposition its flagship brand  which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014   SINKING ROCKS The most successful acquisitions have been those of younger brands  which have room for growth and have yet to develop expensive supply chains and costly  little used store bases   Gap Inc s  N GPS   150 million purchase of athletic and yoga clothing line Athleta Inc in 2008  for example  gave it a foothold in a growing fashion trend  The acquisition helped save Gap when sales of its jeans slowed as shoppers shifted to leggings  Apparel retailers which bought rivals in the hope of finding growth or eliminating competition have found little payoff   Oftentimes  the companies themselves aren t growing  so it doesn t solve the underlying challenge   said Josh Chernoff  managing director  retail at consultant Parthenon EY   If you tie two rocks together  they sink just as fast or faster   The changing winds of fashion derailed Wolverine Worldwide s  1 2 billion acquisition of boat shoe maker Sperry and other brands in 2012  several of which Wolverine tried to sell this year   Shoppers  addiction to discounting crushed Men s Wearhouse Inc s  1 8 billion acquisition of rival Jos  A  Bank  the value of which was almost written off  The suit retailer s sales plunged after it abandoned its famous  buy one get three free  specials in the wake of the 2014 merger   Ascena Retail  Group Inc  O ASNA   one of the few serial acquirers in U S  apparel  has been laid low by its roughly  2 1 billion acquisition of Ann Inc  parent of work wear line Ann Taylor  The 2015 acquisition was meant to give it a full portfolio of womenswear brands and enable it to cut  150 million over three years in costs as it centralized the different lines  internet infrastructure  distribution and manufacturing  But sales for all its brands have dropped  most recently a combined 8 percent in the third quarter of 2017  Ascena s market value is now  400 million  roughly 85 percent lower than before the deal

127367,348882,ANF,Recent Broker Rating Upgrades Make These 5 Stocks Attractive,opinion,The sole aim of investors  while designing their portfolio  is to generate handsome returns  However  with a huge number of stocks flooding the market at a particular point of time  the task is anything but simple  more so in the face of time constraints In fact  the stock market is not an easy place to master and one needs thorough knowledge to rake in profits  This is where some guidance comes in handy  To get proper guidance  investors often fall back on expert advice while arriving at their investment decision  buy  sell or hold   The experts in the field of investing are brokers as they have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them  They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Therefore  the opinion of brokers can act as a valuable guide for investors Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers indulge in thorough research  the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise  Estimate revisions also serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  an increase in estimates normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates  Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy Similarly  analysts might turn bearish and trim estimates  thereby downgrading a stock  following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Naturally  investors look to get rid of such stocks from their portfolio on the basis of broker advice Designing a Winning PortfolioTo take care of the performance with respect to the bottom line  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks While we have talked about

127368,348883,ANF,Can Big 5 Sporting s Initiatives Aid Stock Amid Margin Woes ,opinion,Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation   NASDAQ BGFV   is grappling with strained margins since the past few quarters now  This  in turn  is weighing on the company s bottom line performance  Consequently  the company incurred a loss in four of the trailing five quarters  including fourth quarter 2018  Soft hard good category due to persistent weakness in the firearm related products is an added concern These factors have also hurt investors  sentiments as evident from the company s share price performance in the past six months  Notably  this sporting goods retailer has lost 38 9  against the  s 12 4  rally Let s Delve DeeperBig 5 Sporting recorded the fifth straight quarter of gross margin contraction now  In the most recent quarter  gross margin contracted 150 basis points  reflecting lower distribution expenses due to decline in inventory levels coupled with a slight contraction in merchandise margins  Additionally  the company incurred an operating loss of  5 9 million compared with  7 9 million in the year ago quarter Although Big 5 Sporting s comparable store sales  comps  edged up 1 1  in fourth quarter 2018  it has been reporting soft comps in the previous quarters  mainly due to sluggishness at the hard good category  In the fourth quarter  comps fell in low single digits at this category  The metric also declined in low single digits in October and November but increased in mid single digits during December  Markedly  the company s top line has lagged estimates in four of the last seven quarters  mainly due to soft comps While these concerns make us apprehensive about Big 5 Sporting s performance  its efforts to expand store base and introduce technological advancements for improving services bode well  The company has also been undertaking initiatives to expand its production scale and drive traffic and sales  Currently  it is testing the pricing strategies to achieve the optimal balance between driving sales and maintaining margins  In 2019  Big 5 Sporting plans to open about five stores and close four Moreover  the company is changing its advertising cadence and structure for lending more flexibility to diversify its marketing efforts across the print and digital platforms  Also  it has been reinforcing the value proposition to help improve its competitive position  These apart  management remains focused on managing the cost structure  including efforts to lessen increased wage pressures  to boost margins and profitability Big 5 Sporting s disciplined capital allocation strategy is also impressive  In 2019  management expects capital expenditures of about  12  16 million compared with  15 5 million incurred last year  This amount will be spent on store growth efforts including opening  remodeling  distribution centers as well as investments in the IT systems  Also  it declared a first quarter 2019 cash dividend of 5 cents a share  paid on Mar 22 Wrapping UpEven though Big 5 Sporting is making efforts to lift margins and profitability  the afore mentioned hurdles cannot be ignored  Also  the company s positive comps trend in the fourth quarter is likely to continue  evident from management s projections  Comps are projected to grow in the mid single digit range during the first quarter of 2019 versus a 7 5  decline in the year ago quarter It is also imperative to mention that Big 5 Sporting s fourth quarter 2018 top and bottom lines matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  the company s adjusted loss of 16 cents per share compared favorably with a loss of 62 cents per share incurred in the prior year quarter  Impressively  sales improved year over year growth on higher comps and gains from favorable winter weather across majority of its markets  Moreover  the company witnessed a marginal rise in customer transactions and average sale during the quarter As a result  management issued a bullish earnings view for first quarter 2019  which raises confidence  Quarterly earnings are envisioned to be 4 10 cents per share against a loss of 6 cents incurred in first quarter 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 8 cents These tailwinds might bring this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock back on the growth trajectory in the coming months Three Better Ranked Stocks in the

127369,348884,ANF,Forget L Brands  Buy These 3 Apparel Stocks Instead In 2019,opinion,Bogged down by weak performance of Victoria s Secret and PINK brands  L Brands  Inc    NYSE LB   has been a letdown for investors  Shares of this specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products  home fragrance products and accessories have plummeted 28 5  in a year s time compared with the Zacks  industry s decline of 16 5   Let s take a look at what s plaguing this Zacks Rank 4  Sell  stock What s Giving L Brands a Tough Time L Brands  Victoria s Secret brand appears to be losing appeal  The brand has been witnessing soft sales for quite some time now  owing to weak traffic  Notably  Victoria s Secret sales dropped 5  to  2 532 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  Comparable sales fell 3   while comparable store sales tumbled 7  in this segment L Brands also faces intense competition from American Eagle Outfitters  Aerie brand and Target s Auden brand  which have been successful in luring customers away   With more and more consumers preferring online shopping  a host of emerging e commerce brands are gaining market share and might pose concerns for the Victoria s Secret brand in the near term Victoria s Secret s PINK brand also has its share of problems  Its comparable sales declined in low double digits in the fiscal fourth quarter Moreover  L Brands  gross margin has been contracting year over year for the past few quarters  The company s balance sheet also does not look healthy owing to a high debt level  As of Feb 2  2019  the company had  5 739 4 million of long term debt Management provided a soft guidance for first quarter fiscal 2019  The company anticipates first quarter comparable sales to fall in low single digit  Total sales growth is expected to be roughly 1 point lower than comparable sales growth  This can be attributed to loss of La Senza and Henri Bendel sales   For the first quarter  the company expects breakeven earnings compared with 17 cents in the year ago period For fiscal 2019  the company anticipates comps to rise in low single digits with total sales growth likely to lag comps by about 2 points  Gross margin rate is likely to decrease year over year  mainly due to lower merchandise margins  Further  SG A costs are expected to increase year over year due to a higher wage rate and inflation related pressure Can the Retailer Make a Comeback L Brands remains focused on restructuring the Victoria s Secret brand  which once led the mass market lingerie market in the United States  The company plans to shut down 53 Victoria s Secret stores in fiscal 2019  which failed to generate desired results  Also  the company has relaunched the brand s swimwear category within less than three years of its exit  With this latest move  the company aims at boosting seasonal sales and store traffic Additionally  L Brands concluded the sale of its luxury lingerie brand  La Senza to an affiliate of Regent LP on Jan 6  2019  This move has been appreciated by investors as the brand failed to live up to expectations  Further  in order to focus on its core product categories  L Brands announced plans to close operations at luxury fashion accessories store  Henri Bendel That said  these measures may take a while before they start paying off completely  Hence  it is advisable to steer clear of L Brands as of now Apparel Industry   a Brighter StoryNot all industry players are suffering  A few of them have managed to keep afloat on the back of buoyant consumer environment

127387,348902,ANF,U S  job growth slows  unemployment rate drops to 4 3 percent,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported  suggesting the labor market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16 year low of 4 3 percent 
Nonfarm payrolls increased 138 000 last month as the manufacturing  government and retail sectors lost jobs  the Labor Department said on Friday  The economy created 66 000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April 
Last month s job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13 14 policy meeting  The economy needs to create 75 000 to 100 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
 While the message was a little muddied today  the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening  and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York 
 We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month  Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes  
Details of the employment report were weak  Though the unemployment rate fell one tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001  that was because 429 000 people dropped out of the labor force 
The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment  The jobless rate has declined five tenths of a percentage point this year 
Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0 2 percent in May after a similar gain in April  leaving the year on year increase in wages at 2 5 percent 
Job growth has decelerated from the 181 000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment  There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers 
Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda  including tax cuts and infrastructure spending 
 Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market   said Sung Won Sohn  an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo   The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks  
Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 185 000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4 4 percent  U S  financial markets are almost pricing in a 25 basis point increase in the Fed s benchmark overnight interest rate this month  according to CME FedWatch 
The dollar fell to seven month lows on views the jobs data could portend diminished chances for a Fed rate hike in the second half of the year  Long dated U S  Treasury yields fell to nearly seven month lows  and short dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks  but U S  stocks edged up to new highs   MKTS GLOB  
SHRINKING LABOR MARKET SLACK
The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1 2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year 
While consumer spending picked up in April  a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5 2 percent to  47 6 billion  The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3 4 percent pace in the second quarter 
There was some good news in the employment report  A broad measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  fell two tenths of a percentage point to 8 4 percent  the lowest since November 2007 
As a result  the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge  considered a better measure of labor market slack  was the smallest since early 2008 
But the labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  fell two tenths of a percentage point to 62 7 percent  The volatile 16 24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month  suggesting a rebound is likely 
Manufacturing employment fell by 1 000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1 500 amid declining sales   Ford Motor Co   N F  said last month it planned to cut 1 400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives 
Construction payrolls rose 11 000 last month after decreasing by 1 000 jobs in April  Retail employment fell 6 100  declining for a fourth straight month  with department stores shedding 3 700 jobs 
Department store chains like J C  Penney Co Inc  N JCP   Macy s Inc  N M  and Abercrombie   Fitch  N ANF  are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon  O AMZN   Nonstore retailers  including online merchants  hired 2 900 workers last month 

Government employment decreased 9 000 last month  with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease ",2017-06-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/strong-u.s.-job-growth-expected-in-may;-wage-rise-seen-moderate-491061,491061
127388,348903,ANF,U S  job growth accelerates in June  wages continue to lag,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers  signs of labor market strength that could keep the Federal Reserve on course for a third interest rate hike this year despite sluggish wage gains 
Non farm payrolls jumped by 222 000 jobs last month  driven by hefty gains in healthcare  government  restaurants and professional and business services sectors  the Labor Department said on Friday 
That was the second biggest payrolls increase this year and beat economists  expectations for a 179 000 rise  The economy also created 47 000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported  While the unemployment rate rose to 4 4 percent from a 16 year low of 4 3 percent in May  that was because more people were looking for work  a sign of confidence in the labor market 
 The continued vitality in the U S  labor market means that the Fed is on track to begin shrinking its balance sheet in September and to raise rates again in December   said Nariman Behravesh  chief economist at IHS Markit in Lexington  Massachusetts 
The jobless rate has dropped four tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017  Though the average workweek increased to 34 5 hours from 34 4 hours in May  wage growth remained stubbornly tepid  putting a wrinkle in the otherwise upbeat employment report 
Average hourly earnings increased four cents  or 0 2 percent  in June after gaining 0 1 percent in May  That lifted the year on year wage increase to 2 5 percent from 2 4 percent in May  suggesting some slack still remains in the labor market 
U S  financial markets shrugged off the anemic wage growth and investors focused on the jump in payrolls  which reinforced views that the economy regained speed in the second quarter after a lackluster performance at the start of the year 
Stocks on Wall Street  SPX  were trading higher and the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies  DXY   Prices for U S  Treasuries  US10YT RR  fell 
 The overall takeaway for the growth picture is that the economy seems to have finished the second quarter with decent momentum  and fears of a sharp slowing in the third quarter should be mollified by today s report   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York 
Republican President Donald Trump  who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration  has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes and cutting regulation 
But Republicans have struggled with healthcare legislation overhaul and there are worries that political scandals could derail the Trump administration s economic agenda 
WORKER SHORTAGE
There is optimism that the tightening labor market will soon spur faster wage growth amid growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers  Some economists  including the Fed  believe that weak productivity is constraining wages 
Others argued soft economic growth last year hurt wages 
 Wage inflation was never going to be a 2017 event  You get paid this year based on how your firm did last year and last year was a slow year for GDP and  more importantly  earnings   said Steven Blitz  chief U S  economist at TS Lombard in New York   Wages are accelerating in some industries  just not enough industries to push up the averages  
The Federal Reserve   the U S  central bank   raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in June for the second time this year 
With inflation  however  retreating further below the Fed s 2 percent target in May  economists expect another rate hike only in December 
They expect an announcement in September on starting to reduce the Fed s  4 2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities 
The economy needs to create 75 000 to 100 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population  The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  rose one tenth of a percentage point to 62 8 percent 
A broad measure of unemployment  which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment  rose two tenths of a percentage point to 8 6 percent last month 
This alternative measure of unemployment hit a 9 1 2 year low in May  It has declined eight tenths of a percentage point this year 
Employment gains were broad in June  with manufacturing payrolls rising 1 000 after factories shed 2 000 jobs in May 
But the automobile sector lost a further 1 300 jobs as slowing sales and bloated inventories forced manufacturers to cut production  The sector has shed jobs for three straight months 
 Ford Motor Co   N F  has announced plans to slash 1 400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives  Others  like General Motors  N GM   are embarking on extended summer assembly plant shutdowns  which will leave workers temporarily unemployed 
Construction added another 16 000 jobs last month  Healthcare employment surged by 59 100  while the professional and business services sector created 35 000 jobs  Temporary help jobs  a harbinger of future hiring  increased by 13 400  Restaurants and bars hired 29 300 workers 
Retailers recruited 8 100 workers  a respite for a sector which had shed jobs for four straight months  Department store operators like J C  Penney Co Inc  N JCP   Macy s Inc  N M  and Abercrombie   Fitch  N ANF  are struggling with stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon  O AMZN

127403,348918,ANF,Reasons Behind Tapestry s  TPR  Sluggish Run On The Bourses,opinion,The past six months have not been a smooth ride for Tapestry  Inc    NYSE TPR    as shares of this provider of luxury accessories and lifestyle brands have fallen roughly 34  compared with the  s decline of 16 4   This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock came under pressure following the company s lower than expected second quarter fiscal 2019 results and soft view Analysts have grown bearish on the stock overtime  as evident from downward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2019 and 2020 have moved south by 18 cents and 22 cents in the past 60 days to  2 60 and  2 86  respectively  Although  the consensus mark for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 remained stable in the past 30 days  the same has moved down by 13 cents in the past 60 days Tapestry  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   What s Weighing on the Stock Tapestry s second quarter fiscal 2019 performance did not live up to its expectation on account of volatile macroeconomic environment and geopolitical issues  Moreover  fall in Kate Spade sales was also not well perceived by investors  Although  management expects comparable store sales for the segment to improve in the second half of the fiscal year  analysts remain skeptical about its turnaround  We note that while overall net sales improved marginally  earnings came in line with the year ago period As a result  management forecast fiscal 2019 sales to increase at a low to mid single digit rate year over year  down from mid single digit rate growth previously estimated  The company projects earnings in the band of  2 55  2 60 per share  compared with  2 63 in fiscal 2018   down from the range of  2 75  2 80 envisioned earlier  Tapestry expects operating income and earnings per share to fall in the third quarter  Significant increase in SG A expenses may be cited as one of the reasons behind the same SG A expenses have been increasing for quite some time now  Certainly  any deleverage in the same has a direct bearing on margins  Management expects SG A expenses to increase significantly during the third quarter owing to new store opening plans  investments in systems and shift in Kate Spade marketing spend  For the year  the company expects deleverage in SG A expenses Management Looking in Every Nook   CrannyInstead of sitting idle  management is looking into every corner for growth prospects  Tapestry is trying all means to tackle prevailing headwinds in the retail landscape   soft store traffic  stiff competition from online retailers and aggressive pricing strategy  The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products  stores and marketing Tapestry is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade has been accretive to its performance and is being viewed as a significant step toward becoming a multi brand company  Management expects to attain run rate synergies of approximately  100  115 million from Kate Spade buyout in fiscal 2019 Further  management has undertaken initiatives to have direct control over international distribution  The company concluded the buybacks of the Kate Spade operations in Singapore  Malaysia and Australia  It also completed the buyback of the Stuart Weitzman business in Southern  NYSE SO  China  The company has entered into a deal to acquire the Stuart Weitzman business in Australia from its distribution partner  Such moves help the company to directly operate these businesses  look for growth opportunities in international markets and enhance brand development All said  we hope that the above mentioned initiatives will provide some cushion to the stock and help it return to growth trajectory 3 More Hot Stocks Awaiting Your LookAbercrombie   Fitch Company   NYSE ANF   has outperformed

clear that a winning marketing strategy in retail is providing the best combination of digital and physical store experiences  The strategy is providing a boost to the company s comps  which are anticipated to grow in low single digits during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 Brand StrengthAmerican Eagle rides on its robust brand strength  The company is witnessing continued momentum at the Aerie brand  with comps growth of 23  in the most recent quarter  This marked the brand s 17th straight quarter of double digit comps growth backed by significant momentum in all areas of the business

missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining year over year  Performance was hit by sluggishness at pre owned video game as well as lower sales of new video game hardware and software  Also  the additional 53rd week in 2017 led to an unfavorable year on year comparison To top these  the company provided an unimpressive sales and comps view for fiscal 2019  Bottom line view for the first

hardware sales declined 9 8  to  761 3 million  Higher sales of Nintendo Switch were more than offset by declines in sales of Xbox One X as well as adverse impacts from the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 New video game software sales fell 7 8  to  961 4 million  thanks to earlier launch of key titles and adverse impacts from the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 Pre owned and value video game products sales

127441,348956,ANF,Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY  Catches Investors  Eye  Here s Why,opinion,Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   drew investors  attention after activist investors expressed their intention to make major changes to the company s board of directors  The stock went up as much as 22  on Mar 26  Per sources  activist investors including Legion Partners Asset Management LLC  Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Ancora Advisors LLC are working to oust all 12 members of the board Media reports also revealed that the group is likely to submit 16 nominees to take over the company s board at the Annual Meeting  The investor group wants to replace the company s chief executive officer as well  The activist investor group owns a combined stake of 5  in the company  Per sources  the reason cited behind this major move is the failure of the current management team to keep up with the evolving retail scenario However  Bed Bath   Beyond responded to the activist investors by issuing a statement  The company notified that it is working in the best interest of its shareholders and had discussions with Legion and Macellum in the recent weeks  In fact  management also asked for better ideas and recommendations to enhance its business  Per management  they did not give any suggestions rather opted to attack the company publicly Moreover  the company stated that the board consistently assesses its composition  reflecting the right talent and expertise  Also  the board values the latest perspectives and diversity  As a result  three independent directors have joined Bed Bath   Beyond in the past two years and the company s one third directors are diverse  in sync with the board s ongoing refreshment agenda Also  the company said that it is going through a comprehensive transformation to develop its foundational structure  boost shareholder value and position well in the long term  Moreover  Bed Bath   Beyond is progressing well with its efforts to become one of the best customer focused retailers On its third quarter fiscal 2018 s conference call  Bed Bath   Beyond had stated that it is ahead of plan in relation to its long term financial targets  The company s long term financial goals include moderating declines in operating profit and net earnings per share in fiscal 2018 and 2019  Moreover  the company expects to witness net earnings per share growth by fiscal 2020  Earnings per share are envisioned to be about  2 00 for fiscal 2018 How is Bed Bath   Beyond Performing Bed Bath   Beyond is trying all means to adapt to the changing retail landscape  wherein the competition has intensified  However  the company is still struggling with dismal comparable store sales  comps  performance on account of lower store transactions  Comps dipped 1 8  in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on a mid single digit decline in sales from stores  somewhat offset by robust sales at the customer facing digital networks We note that comps slipped 0 6  in both the second and first quarter of fiscal 2018  and also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  The metric fell 0 3   2 6  and 2  in the third  second and first quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  In fact  comps are projected to decline about 1  in fiscal 2018 Also  for fiscal 2019  management had earlier estimated comps to dwindle in a low single digit on lower store traffic Apart from a weak comps trend  Bed Bath   Beyond is battling margin pressures for quite some time now  Gross margin contracted 210 basis points  bps  in the fiscal third quarter  mainly due to lower merchandise margin coupled with higher coupon expenses  Lower gross margin coupled with higher SG A expenses resulted in operating margin contraction of 300 bps in the last reported quarter Further  the company had projected gross margin deleverage for fiscal 2018  primarily on investments in the customer value proposition and the digital channels  Further  SG A expenses are estimated to increase due to higher investments toward transformational efforts Dismal comps and strained margins trend are well reflected in Bed Bath   Beyond s price performance  This Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock

127453,348968,ANF,U S  job growth accelerates in January  but wages lag,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  job growth surged more than expected in January as construction firms and retailers ramped up hiring  but wages barely rose  handing the Trump administration both a head start and a challenge as it seeks to boost the economy 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 227 000 jobs  the largest gain in four months  the Labor Department said on Friday  The unemployment rate  however  rose one tenth of a percentage point to 4 8 percent and wages increased by only three cents  suggesting that there was still some slack in the labor market 
Still  the labor market is tightening and could hopefully soon spur faster wage growth  Federal Reserve officials view the jobs market as being at or near full employment 
U S  government bond prices initially rose as traders focused on the disappointing wage growth  which investors saw as keeping the Fed on a gradual path of interest rate increases this year  In the afternoon  U S  Treasuries were trading lower while the dollar edged up against a basket of currencies 
Stocks on Wall Street rose  with the S P 500 index  SPX  approaching its record peak 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 175 000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4 7 percent  The economy created 39 000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported 
 While there s a great deal of anticipation surrounding steps that President Trump and the GOP led Congress are expected to take to boost the economy  that s going to take more time   said Mark Hamrick  a senior economic analyst at Bankrate com in Washington 
President Donald Trump vowed during last year s election campaign to deliver 4 percent annual gross domestic product growth  largely on the back of a plan to cut taxes  reduce regulations  increase infrastructure spending and renegotiate trade deals in the United States  favor 
Although details on the policy proposals remain sketchy  consumer and business confidence have surged in the wake of Trump s election victory last November  But with the economy near full employment  some economists are skeptical of the 4 percent growth pledge  Annual GDP growth has not exceeded 2 6 percent since the 2007 08 recession 
Trump  who during the election campaign regularly dismissed the job numbers and the unemployment rate as  phony  and  one of the biggest hoaxes   welcomed January s acceleration in hiring 
 So we re very happy about that  I think that it s going to continue big league   said Trump 
DISAPPOINTING WAGE GROWTH
Average hourly earnings edged up 0 1 percent last month  below expectations for a 0 3 percent rise  December s wage gain was revised down to 0 2 percent from the previously reported 0 4 percent increase 
There was a big decline in earnings in the financial sector last month  which probably offset minimum wage increases that took effect in 19 states in January  The small gain lowered the year on year increase in earnings to 2 5 percent from 2 8 percent in December 
Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3 5 percent in wages is needed to lift inflation to the Fed s 2 percent target  Sluggish wage growth  if it persists  would suggest little urgency from the Fed to tighten monetary policy 
The pace of rate hikes will  however  probably depend on how much inflation is generated from Trump s proposed measures to bolster economic growth  The U S  central bank  which raised rates in December  has forecast three rate increases this year 
 The tepid wage data and the relative stability of the unemployment rate should allow the Fed to proceed with rate normalization at an unhurried pace   said Michael Feroli  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York   We continue to look for the next hike at the June meeting  
On Wednesday  the Fed kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in a range of 0 50 percent to 0 75 percent  It said it expected labor market conditions would strengthen  somewhat further  
With its January employment report  the government published its annual  benchmark  revisions and updated the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations  It also incorporated new population estimates 
The government said the level of employment in March of last year was 60 000 lower than it had reported  As the labor market nears full employment  the pool of workers is shrinking  which is slowing job growth 
The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  was at 62 9 percent in January  the highest level since September  The employment to population ratio was at 59 9 percent last month  the highest level since March 2016 
A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment rose two tenths of a percentage point to 9 4 percent last month 
Nearly all sectors of the economy added jobs in January  Manufacturing payrolls rose by 5 000 jobs  rising for a second straight month  The gains were mostly at factories making machinery  nonmetallic mineral products  transportation equipment  food and furniture 
 Plenty to build on here for Donald Trump who has tended to put a premium on manufacturing jobs   said Alan Ruskin  global head of G10 FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  in New York 
Construction employment jumped 36 000  the largest increase since March  likely boosted by warm weather  The housing sector led the construction job gains 
Retail payrolls  surprisingly surged 45 900  the biggest rise since February  Retailers  including Macy s  N M   Sears  O SHLD   American Apparel and Abercrombie   Fitch  N ANF  announced job cuts in January amid store closures

There is no hard and fast rule that lucrative returns can only come from risky securities  Many strategies show that investing in low risk portfolios end up giving you handsome returns 
Since risky stocks underperform market amid a bearish business scenario  it could be a good idea to consider some key parameters to create a portfolio of low beta stocks 
Beta Understanding
Beta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market 
If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 
For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market

127483,348998,ANF,New Look seeks fashion edge in China with local designs,news,"By Emma Thomasson and Donny Kwok BERLIN HONG KONG  Reuters    As Europe s fashion giants brace for what could be the toughest leg of their expansion in China  a South African retail tycoon has launched a bold assault on the world s most populous nation  Christo Wiese is promising to open 500 of his New Look stores in just three years  catapulting the British brand into the same league in China as the world s top fashion chains   Spain s  Inditex   MC ITX  and Sweden s H M  ST HMb    His plan is to make most of the clothes in China to ensure they cater to local tastes and can get to stores quickly   a strategy similar to the one successfully pursued in Europe by Zara owner Inditex  The arrival of New Look   and its local sourcing strategy   poses a new risk for the likes of H M and Inditex  already suffering from slower growth in China  fierce competition for real estate and the cost of investing in ecommerce   H M is opening more stores in China this year than anywhere else in the world and the country is already the second biggest market for Inditex outside Spain  China is a big draw for retailers who hope to tap the aspirations of a fast growing middle class  with mid range names benefiting as consumers trade down from luxury brands since Beijing s clampdown on corruption and conspicuous spending  But recent history offers plenty of examples of failure  Western brands that have struggled in China include Gap Inc  N GPS   Abercrombie   Fitch  N ANF  and Marks and Spencer  L MKS   which decided last year to close five stores in smaller cities to focus on flagship stores in large cities and online   Most of the Western fashion labels that are mid range fail in China  A large part of it is that the styles and the fit are so completely different   said Shaun Rein  founder of market intelligence firm China Market Research  LOCAL TASTES  LOCAL SOURCING New Look  a chain founded in 1969 and bought last year by Wiese s investment vehicle  Brait  SE  J BATJ   does not want to make the same mistake  It now runs 94 stores in China  out of a global total of 852  and hopes to have up to 150 by next March   I will definitely give it a try if it is a foreign brand and as long as I like it   said Chen Jie  a 32 year old businessman from Shenzhen who was carrying an H M bag in a shopping district in Hong Kong   Price is not an issue but the design and quality must be good   While New Look is cashing in on the popularity in China of British style   it is adding the  London  tag to its logo for its Chinese stores and website   it is also catering for local tastes  Sven Gaede  managing director of New Look s international business  says the firm has an advantage over many European rivals as 85 percent of what it sells in China is sourced locally and more than a third is designed exclusively for China  That has allowed New Look to tap into the current popularity in Asia of culottes   flared  three quarter length trousers  Gaede said they account for 12 percent of the firm s sales in China  though they are not popular in its European markets   South Korea and Japan drive a lot of the trends that the Chinese customer seeks  so our ability to be able to identify those trends  source them locally and get them into our stores quickly is key   said Gaede  That helps explain the success of the Uniqlo chain of Japan s Fast Retailing  T 9983  in China  which already has almost 500 stores in the country and is aiming for 1 000 stores in about five years   more than in Japan   It s pretty hard for the foreign fast brands to do the localization that Uniqlo does in China as it was born with the Asian gene   said Violet Shen  a marketing executive in Shanghai  The  fast fashion  model was pioneered by Inditex  which can bring new styles from the catwalk to stores in Europe within days from factories mostly in Spain and North Africa  However  Inditex does not have the same advantage in China  Inditex plans to add 60 stores in the next few years to the 582 it already runs in China  but it serves them from its logistics centers in Spain   As their proportion of sales increases in the East  it challenges this model  You can t hub out of Spain   said Dominic Jephcott  chief executive of supply chain experts Vendigital  New Look is not the first Western retailer to try to bring the Inditex model to China  Denmark s Bestseller  which runs brands like Vero Moda and Jack   Jones  says over 90 percent of its products sold in China are also produced in China and most of the designs for the Chinese market are adjusted to local tastes  That has helped the family owned firm to become the clear leader in China  with more than 6 800 stores in over 300 cities  to give it a 2 percent share of the fragmented market  according to market research firm Euromonitor  Anders Kristiansen ran the China business of Bestseller before taking over as New Look chief executive in 2013  Gaede said Kristiansen s experience in Asia is one of the reasons behind the group s aggressive expansion strategy  H M also buys many of its garments in China   the country accounts for about a quarter of its global sourcing  But the Swedish firm does not make a big point of adjusting its ranges for China  where it has opened 47 stores in the last nine months  taking its total to 400   We see that fashion becomes more and more global and that China doesn t differ much from the rest of the world regarding trends and fashion   said investor relations head Nils Vinge   There are of course local differences but that is true for every market  H M has a business model that can adapt to this   Vinge said  declining to elaborate  Rein of China Market Research says Western brands must strike a delicate balance   You have to keep your global brand image and you can t be that creatively different in China than other markets  The Chinese travel around the world   he said   It is good to localize  But it hard to localize an aspiration   STORES VS ECOMMERCE A bigger challenge for New Look may be to secure the right locations  especially as rivals also seek to add hundreds of stores in the coming years   To find 500 stores of real estate and roll that out in the right way     I think it is virtually impossible   said Franklin Yao  managing partner at strategy consultants Smith Street  But the more established New Look s brand becomes in China  Gaede said  the better the locations and terms it will be offered  adding that the firm was now pushing into smaller cities   We are less wedded to the number each year and we are more wedded to getting quality locations   he said  Meeting soaring Chinese demand for buying clothes online is also tough  Most international brands initially launch on Chinese ecommerce sites like JD com  O JD  and Alibaba s  N BABA  Tmall and Taobao  but are keen to build up their own online operations to protect margins and integrate ecommerce and store services  New Look is currently available on Tmall and JD com  but plans its own transactional site in the next 12 to 18 months  Partnering with Chinese sites and local payment and delivery service providers is essential to reach consumers across such a vast country  said Vendigital s Jephcott  
 It is a hard physical push and a very hard digital push  all premised on a strong relationship with the logistics partner like Taobao   Jephcott said  noting that Taobao has established a delivery network of micro stores even in small towns ",2016-10-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-look-seeks-fashion-edge-in-china-with-local-designs-433775,433775

Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen s testimony to Congress on Thursday suggested that the U S  central bank would be ready to hike rates at the December 13 14 meeting 
Yellen s remarks  coupled with a strong reading on the labor market as initial jobless claims hit their lowest level since 1973  continued to support the dollar on Friday 
The greenback hit fresh 14 year highs against a basket of other currencies Friday  marking an intraday high of 101 44  That was its highest level since April 2003 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  inched up 0 01  to 101 01 by 7 06AM ET  12 06GMT  
On the other side of the Atlantic  investors were focused on European Central Bank  ECB  president Mario Draghi who promised to maintain monetary stimulus until it was clear that euro zone inflation was self sustainable
 Going forward  our assessment will depend on whether we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards that objective   Draghi told the European Banking Conference in Frankfurt 
 And that means that inflation convergence towards 2  is durable  even with a reduction in monetary accommodation  Inflation dynamics  in other words  need to be self sustained   he explained 
Draghi s dovish comments  coupled with the strength in the dollar  took EUR USD to an intraday low of 1 0582 on Friday  It was last trading flat  but if the pair were to end the day in the read  the 10 day losing streak would be its longest stretch since the creation of the euro in 1999 
Stateside  investors would digest a deluge of comments from Fed officials 
Earlier on Friday  St  Louis Fed president James Bullard indicated that he would likely support a December rate hike 
 Markets are currently putting a high probability on a December move by the FOMC   he said 
 I m leaning toward supporting that   Bullard added 
New York Fed president William Dudley  Kansas City Fed chief Esther George  Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan  Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans and Fed governor Jerome Powell will all make appearances throughout the day

Oil prices edged higher on Friday on hopes of a potential oil production freeze deal 
After a meeting with some OPEC counterparts on Friday in Qatar  Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said he was confident the cartel would be able to reach an agreement by their official meeting on November 30 
Saudi energy minister Khalid al Falih had said on Thursday that he was optimistic that OPEC would formalize a preliminary oil output deal reached in Algeria in September

127488,349003,ANF,U S  stocks slip as investors contemplate future Fed rate hikes,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower on Friday as investors came to grip with the fact that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise rates at the December 13 14 policy meeting 
At 11 07AM ET  16 07GMT   the Dow Jones dropped 40 points  or 0 21   the S P 500 lost 6 points  or 0 26  while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded down 15 points  or 0 28  
Federal Reserve  Fed  chair Janet Yellen s testimony to Congress on Thursday suggested that the U S  central bank would be ready to hike rates at the December 13 14 meeting 
Earlier on Friday  St  Louis Fed president James Bullard indicated that he would likely support a December rate hike 
 Markets are currently putting a high probability on a December move by the FOMC   he said 
 I m leaning toward supporting that   Bullard added 
Kansas City Fed chief Esther George  who dissented on the policy vote several times this year based on her preference for a 25 basis point hike  repeated her concern that the U S  economy could face danger of overheating and reiterated her belief that it was time to begin tightening policy 
 I see moving sooner  rather than later  as taking into account the long and variable lags with which monetary policy operates  and reduces the potential for  go stop  types of policies that create volatility  rather than subdue it   she explained at a conference on Friday 
New York Fed president William Dudley did not speak on the outlook for monetary policy in open remarks delivered on Friday 
Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan  Chicago Fed chief Charles Evans and Fed governor Jerome Powell were also on tap to make appearances throughout the day 
The recent remarks from several Fed officials pointing to December as a likely time to return to  gradual  policy normalization pushed up market expectations for a move at the end of the year 
According to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  odds for a December rate hike were last at 90 6   compared to just 81 1  the previous week 
Markets also had their eyes on a second rate hike in mid 2017  with chances passing the 50  threshold that the Fed would increase again at the July 26 decision 
The heightened expectations for policy tightening also supported the dollar this week as it hit fresh 14 year highs against a basket of other currencies Friday  marking an intraday high of 101 53  That was its highest level since April 2003 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  inched up 0 01  to 101 01 by 11 10AM ET  16 10GMT  
On a light day for economic data  the Conference Board s leading indicators rose 0 1  in October as expected 
In big moves on earnings  Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  saw shares sink almost 11  as the teen apparel retailer reported a 15th consecutive quarter of sales declines 
Gap  NYSE GPS  saw itself in a similar situation with losses of nearly 12  as it registered its seventh successive quarter of declines in sales and admitted that customer traffic was a challenge 
On the upside  Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  bucked the trend as the discount retailer beat on the top and bottom line  Shares soared more than 4  
Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  also saw gains of around 4  on a quarterly profit beat that led the software company to give an upbeat forecast 
Meanwhile  oil prices retreated on Friday on continued skepticism over OPEC s chances of reaching a meaningful deal over OPEC production 
Despite optimistic comments from various major oil producers  energy ministers  a report on Friday said that OPEC proposed to Iran that it cap its oil output at 3 92 million barrels per day

    Net sales of  2 492 1 million decreased 6 5  year over year but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 480 million  This decline is attributed to difficult comparison due to sales worth  105

consolidated comparable store sales  comps  fell 2 2   Including the 53rd week  consolidated comps declined 3 7   In the year ago quarter  comps dipped 2  Core business gains primarily contributed to sales growth  backed by positive response from athletes for the company s merchandising  e commerce and marketing initiatives  This resulted in positive comps for key categories   including apparel  athletic footwear  outdoor equipment  fitness and private label brands  However  these gains were significantly offset by persistent weakness in hunting and electronics businesses  which negatively impacted comps by 3  on a combined basis Further  e commerce sales grew 17  year over year  excluding the calendar shift  E commerce penetration improved to about 23  of net sales in the reported quarter  up from 19  in the prior year quarter Delving DeeperGross margin contracted 168 bps to 27 9  in the quarter under review  This was driven by a 37 bps decrease in merchandise margins  higher

127503,349018,ANF,Bull Of The Day  Abercrombie And Fitch  ANF ,opinion,"Abercrombie and Fitch  NYSE ANF   is in the midst of a successful reinvention 
You don t have to be too old to remember the days when the Abercrombie image consisted of attractive young models spritzing fragrances on passerby in front of nightclub themed mall stores  Though the strategy seems dated now   how many mall shoppers want to be accosted by a shirtless guy with a bottle of perfume    it actually worked well for a while and Abercrombie became one of the world s most popular brands of clothing and accessories for teens and young adults 
By 2014  management at Abercrombie astutely realized that they were going to need a new strategy in order to continue to appeal to the notoriously fickle tastes of younger consumers  The result is a new digital approach that uses a diverse set of media outlets to support the company s brands and styles and keep them relevant to their target audiences and also provides a convenient and easy way for those consumers to buy goods directly from the company 
The Brand Strategy
ANF operates three separate brands   Abercrombie and Fitch for the 21 24 age group  Hollister for teens and college students and Abercrombie Kids  targeting consumers from 7 14  or their parents  
The new strategy involves closing underperforming retail locations and remodeling existing locations to utilize a smaller footprint  It also emphasizes direct to consumer sales through the company s digital  omni channel   which was designed to create a best in class customer experience while simultaneously growing profitability 
Abercrombie closed 29 stores in 2018 and plans to shutter 40 more in 2019  In most cases  store closures happen when a poorly performing outlet reaches the end of its current lease  greatly reducing the cost of shuttering locations 
Approximately 50  of existing store leases expire within the next three years  providing the company flexibility in their decisions to keep or close individual stores 
The new marketing effort focuses heavily on internet and social media channels and a reduced presence in traditional media  The company uses  influencers  on Twitter  Instagram and other platforms and  recently produced an original Television series for YouTube  Broadcast on their  Awesomeness TV  channel   The Carpe Life  features appealing glimpses of teen life while subtly including the companies wares 
After a difficult stretch in 2016 that was highlighted by four consecutive earnings misses due to slow sales and rising expenses  Abercrombie has been on a tear ever since  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate eight consecutive times  highlighted by a 20  beat in the first quarter of 2019 

Net Q1 earnings at Abercrombie were  1 35 share versus an expected  1 12 share  Revenues were  1 16B  slightly topping estimates of  1 13B  The earnings improvement was largely the result of the cost saving of operating fewer retail locations and selling more product online  Roughly a third of sales occur through the online portal 
Same store sales increased for a sixth straight quarter   a predictable outcome given the closure of low performing retail locations  Full year Store Operating Expenses across the company in 2018 were  629M  a significant reduction from 2017 s  659M 
Abercrombie s guidance for 2019 prompted an immediate runup in the shares  which rallied 20  the day following the Q1 report 
The company expects net sales to increase 2 4   same store sales up  low single digits   and gross profit to continue to increase 
Analyst expectations for the coming two years increased almost immediately after the Q1 report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2019 has risen 42  since before the most recent report and the estimate for 2020 is up almost 100  
Abercrombie has gone in a decidedly high tech direction when it comes to attracting and retaining customers and the results in terms of earnings and share price have been encouraging  The stock price remains well below the 2007 highs of  84 share   the last time it was on top of the apparel retail world   but given their unique and innovative approach  they re headed in that direction again

304 6 million  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  306 million  The top line declined due to calendar shift and deferred revenues related to the company s Stash loyalty program  However  this was partly offset by comps growth and the addition of nine stores since the end of fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Quarterly comps grew 3 9   up from the company s forecast of 3  rise  Comps benefited from higher transaction volume and growth in dollars per transaction  Strength in the men s  women s  hard goods and footwear categories also aided comps growth Gross profit fell 0 6  to  113 9 million in

driven by cash flow from operations  partly offset by capital expenditures  Total shareholders  equity at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter was  400 5 million Further  the company generated  65 3 million as cash flow from operations  and incurred capital expenditure of  21 million in fiscal 2018 For fiscal 2019  the company anticipates capital expenditures between  21 million and  23 million

127529,349044,ANF,Abercrombie signals better year as Hollister sales improve,news,"By Ramkumar Iyer  Reuters    Abercrombie   Fitch Co  N ANF  said its business was showing signs of recovery as sales of its Hollister branded clothes improved  suggesting that recent efforts to revitalize the teen apparel retailer may be starting to pay off  The company s shares rose nearly 12 percent on Thursday after it reported comparable sales fell less than expected in the first quarter ended May 2  as revamped Hollister stores and lower prices drove traffic  Abercrombie  once popular for the preppy clothing it sold under its namesake brand  has been struggling to revive flagging sales as customers have tired of its logo centric apparel  Such apparel has been replaced by trendier clothing with new styles in denim and floral prints over the past months  The company has cut prices in some international markets for its Hollister line  which offers South California inspired t shirts  skirts  tops and hoodies  Abercrombie has changed the music  lighting and how it stacks clothes in several Hollister stores  moves that have resulted in slightly higher sales  Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez said on a post earnings call  The company said it expects comparable sales to improve through the year and forecast full year gross margins to be flat with or slightly higher than a year earlier  helped by lower costs  Still  there s a long way to go  For one  company wide same store sales still fell 8 percent in the quarter  though less than the 8 7 percent analysts on average had expected  according to Consensus Metrix   There s really a lot of things they re working on right now  but  a turnaround  is not going to really happen overnight   FBR Capital Markets analyst Susan Anderson said   But I think we ll continue to see incremental improvement throughout the year   Comparable sales at Hollister fell 6 percent  less than the 8 9 percent decline analysts had expected  Net sales declined 14 percent to  709 4 million and net loss nearly tripled to  63 2 million  or 91 cents per share  Abercrombie  which gets nearly 37 percent of its revenue from international markets  said it expects a stronger dollar to continue eating into revenue this year  The dollar  which had risen 1 81 percent against a basket of currencies from February to April  lowered Abercrombie s sales by about 6 percent in the latest quarter

127531,349046,ANF,Q4 Retail Earnings Scorecard  2 Turnaround Surprises  1 Lagging Initiative,opinion,"The last group of companies to report Q4 earnings this season were major U S  retailers  and the results were a decidedly mixed  On the winning side were the companies that have worked out online strategies to compete with Amazon  while also finding the right mix of products and services to keep shoppers coming into their stores  On the flip side are the laggards that have have failed to keep up with the changing tastes and buying habits of American consumers 
Now that all the information is in  here s a closer look at two retailers that surprised and one that severely disappointed 
Winner  Abercrombie   Fitch Transformation Initiatives Gaining Traction
Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  easily beat fourth quarter forecasts when it reported on March 6  Results showed the apparel and accessories retailer successfully continuing a turnaround of its teen clothing chain 
Shares of Abercrombie  which closed at  26 64 yesterday  spiked around 20  after its report  and are up roughly 19 5  over the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 index is nearly flat over the past 12 months  while the S P Retail Select Industry Index lost 0 7  

Abercrombie   Fitch  which also owns Hollister  earned  1 35 per share during the fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb  2  topping average analyst estimates by 20 cents  Sales at locations open for at least a year jumped 3   double analyst consensus  thanks to strong performance in the U S 
Notably  the company s digital business continued to execute well  Digital channel sales surged 36  in the fiscal fourth quarter and topped the  1 billion mark for the full year 
The teen apparel company has been trying to turn around its struggling business by shrinking the size of its stores  boosting online sales and changing up its marketing strategy through loyalty programs and other initiatives  During the earnings call  CEO Fran Horowitz said   Our transformation initiatives are gaining traction  
Looking to fiscal 2019  Abercrombie provided a robust forecast  It expects the momentum from strong top line growth  gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage witnessed in fiscal 2018 to continue 
The retailer is planning to remodel or add 85 locations this year  up from 67 in 2018  It is also planning to close up to 40 stores  mostly in the U S 
From a technical perspective  ANF shares charged above their 200 day moving average late last week  That s a bullish development likely to signal more gains in the weeks ahead 
Winner  Best Buy s Death by E Commerce Greatly Exaggerated
Shares of Best Buy  NYSE BBY  have been on a tear since the company reported better than expected holiday quarter sales on Feb  27 and gave an upbeat profit forecast for the year  The blockbuster report sent the stock up 14  that day 
Nonetheless  the stock  which closed yesterday at  68 72  is still down about 7  in the past year 

The electronics retailer  which cited the frenzy around the popular  Fortnite  video game as a catalyst for a boost in sales of gaming gear  also announced an 11  hike to its quarterly dividend  bringing its yield to almost 3   and a plan to buy back  3 billion of stock 
Investments in its online business are also starting to pay off  Best Buy s domestic online revenue surged 9 3  in the three months ended Feb  2  to  2 96 billion 
Perhaps more significant  Best Buy has managed to ward off pressure from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   by focusing on customer services that have helped drive both store and online sales  A  199 per year  Total Tech Support  program launched in May  which includes unlimited support online and in stores  saw 1 million members sign up by the end of the year  the company said 
 Our customers are noticing the improved experience we provide them as they interact with us digitally  in stores or in their homes   CEO Hubert Joly said  Joly attributed the company s performance  in part  to technological innovation  which he said could  drive customer demand  
From a technical perspective  following its earnings beat  BBY crossed above its 200 DMA near  68 96 for the first time since November  only to fall back below it the following week  The stock next needs to successfully close above that level in the near term to show that buyers are in control 
Loser  Kroger Digital Sales Growth Falling Further Behind Peers
Investors did not like what Kroger  NYSE KR  had to say when it released weaker than expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings on March 7  The grocery store chain has been struggling to compete against both e tail and brick and mortar giants such as Amazon and Walmart  NYSE WMT  
Shares of Kroger  which ended at  24 67 yesterday  tumbled approximately 10  in response to the disappointing report  Over the past year  the stock has gained 2 4  

For Q4  which ended Feb  2  Kroger s earnings and revenue came in below expectations  The supermarket chain warned that its fiscal 2019 earnings will be worse than anticipated as it invests in new online initiatives in order to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive market 
The Cincinnati based company  which also runs gas stations  forecast full year earnings of between  2 15 and  2 25 per share  falling short of Wall Street expectations of  2 26 
Profits are expected to come under pressure as the retailer plans to spend even more to overhaul stores and improve its online business under a program the company is calling  Restock Kroger   The initiative  which was launched over a year ago  calls for the grocery chain to invest as much as  3 2 billion in fiscal 2019 on on the effort  up from  3 billion last year 
Ever since Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August 2017  grocers have been forced to step up their tech investments to avoid losing customers to the e commerce giant  Despite seeing a 58  increase in digital sales growth during its fourth quarter however  some on Wall Street are unsure of Kroger s ability to compete with its heavy hitting peers  According to a recent note from Pivotal Research on Kroger s efforts   Fiscal 2018 showed that while spending on omni channel and digital growth strategies are very significant  the benefits haven t been nearly as obvious so far  ",2019-03-12,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/q4-retail-earnings-scorecard-2-surprising-winners-and-1-big-loser-200396677,200396677

127552,349067,ANF,Teen Retailers Struggle To Stay Cool ,news,"By   

Wearing T shirts with  AERO  or eagle logos emblazoned prominently across the front used to be cool among American teens trying to blend in with their peers  Not anymore 
Brands like Aeropostale NYSE ARO  American Eagle NYSE AEO  Abercrombie NYSE ANF and its offshoot Hollister are known for classic  preppy styles like collared polos and denim mini skirts  But they ve been losing shoppers in recent years to trendier retailers like Forever 21 and H M  stores that move merchandise through much quicker and sell cheaper  funkier looks that individualize the wearer 
Last week  Aero reported a nearly  64 million profit loss in the second quarter compared to the first  nearly twice as much as last year  while American Eagle reported a nearly  20 million loss in profit  a 70 percent decline over the same period a year ago  Abercrombie will announce second quarter earnings Thursday 
Analysts polled by Reuters predict profit will fall about 40 percent from  11 4 million to  8 1 million over the May to July period  compared to the year earlier period  Earnings per share are expected to come in at 11 cents per share on revenue of  909 million  compared to 14 cents per share on  946 million in the year earlier period 
Since 2012  Abercrombie s sales have declined by about 25 percent  according to research from the bank Oppenheimer   Co  Inc  NYSE OPY  Its offshoot brand Hollister  featuring lower price points and trendier styles  has seen sales fall 17 percent over the same period 
But analysts are optimistic that Abercrombie is making a comeback  leading the  triple A  brands back into competition 
 They re probably in the best position because they have the strongest brand  a global brand  a lot of opportunity to explore there  and a two brand  approach  that lets them differentiate   said Susan Anderson  retail analyst for FBR Capital Markets 
The company is undergoing an extensive   175 million cost cutting program that began last year and kicked into high gear this year  Abercrombie plans to close 60 to 70 underperforming stores this year  after closing about 50 last year  and is upping its presence on Facebook  Twitter and Instagram  where customers hang out 
Boarding up stores and laying off cashiers seems to be working so far  in line with Abercrombie s aggressive strategy to increase online sales  Last quarter  its online sales rose by 27 percent compared to the year earlier period 
Abercrombie is also selling fewer items featuring its logo  introducing more trends into its fashion  and slashing prices a bit  especially for its Hollister brand  taking it back to its California surfer style roots 
 Their fashion is becoming more mixed  improving  Their logo investment is down dramatically   said Anna Andreeva  specialty retail analyst for Oppenheimer   And their sales are declining less  
Even the stores themselves look and feel different  Many locations have softened the clublike music and taken away shutters and curtains from the storefront that gave an air of mystery and exclusivity 
This back to school shopping season will test whether or not Abercrombie and its fellow  A  brands have what it takes to win back their customer bases   
 The brands are real and fixable  but  they  have been mismanaged recently   Andreeva said ",2014-08-27,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/teen-retailers-struggle-to-stay-cool-306028,306028

127557,349072,ANF,Wall Street loses ground on Ukraine worry,news,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stocks edged lower on Thursday after the latest tension between Ukraine and Russia snapped the focus of investors back to the volatile region  but U S  economic data helped curb losses 
Worries over tension abroad had largely receded from Wall Street  with major indexes seeing few negative days over the past two weeks  and the Dow and S P both hitting record highs 
Ukraine s security and defense council said the border town of Novoazovsk and other areas of Ukraine s south east had fallen under the control of Russian forces  together with rebels  The U S  accused Russia of active fighting in Eastern Ukraine  and said it was considering a range of responses  including more sanctions 
While few U S  companies have heavy exposure to either country  investors are concerned about the potential response by the United States and Europe to any escalation in hostility 
A trio of economic reports pointed to improving conditions and helped mitigate declines  The second reading of gross domestic product showed the U S  economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter  while jobless claims fell for a second straight week 
In addition  July pending home sales rose far more than had been expected to an 11 month high  The PHLX housing index  HGX  lost 0 4 percent  but was off earlier lows 
 The data did cheer things up  but the stuff that is happening in the Ukraine is worrisome and I m glad to at least see a little bit of red out there today because of that   said Kim Forrest  senior equity research analyst  Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh 
The Dow Jones industrial average  DJI  fell 42 44 points or 0 25 percent  to 17 079 57  the S P 500  SPX  lost 3 38 points or 0 17 percent  to 1 996 74 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  dropped 11 93 points or 0 26 percent  to 4 557 70 
Since falling to a near three month low on Aug  7  the benchmark S P index had risen for 11 of the prior 14 sessions  pushing it above 2 000 for the previous two days  However  recent daily moves have been slight and trading volume has been among the lightest of the year 
An index of major shares in Europe  which has more exposure to the region  closed down 0 6 percent  FTEU3   If European Reconomic growth is depressed by the conflict  that could have an indirect impact on the United States  Russia s dollar denominated RTS index  IRTS  slumped 3 3 percent while the Market Vectors Russia Exchange Traded Fund  P RSX  fell 3 1 percent to  24 37 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating media reports that several U S  financial firms have been victims of recent cyber attacks  JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  said it was investigating a possible attack  shares fell 0 7 percent to  59 16  The S P financial index lost 0 4 percent as the worst performing of the 10 major S P groups 
Abercrombie   Fitch Co  N ANF  lost 4 8 percent to  41 87 after the retailer s second quarter same store sales fell more than expected  Williams Sonoma Inc  N WSM  tumbled 12 percent to  65 93 a day after reporting its results and giving an outlook 
Volume continued to be on the light side  with about 4 16 billion shares traded on U S  exchanges  well below the 5 34 billion average so far this month  according to data from BATS Global Markets

127558,349073,ANF,Abercrombie resolves CEO pay lawsuit  to tighten governance,news,"By Jonathan Stempel  Reuters    Abercrombie   Fitch Co s  N ANF  board agreed to make governance changes to resolve a lawsuit objecting to its awarding longtime Chief Executive Officer Michael Jeffries more than  140 million of compensation since 2007 
The negotiated settlement  which requires court approval and includes no monetary payment to shareholders  was disclosed on Friday  less than an hour after the underlying lawsuit was filed in the U S  District Court in Columbus  Ohio 
Abercrombie agreed to appoint a chief ethics and compliance officer  tie executive pay more closely to performance  bolster anti corruption compliance training  and limit access to nonpublic data to Jeffries  partner and other third parties  among other provisions  court papers show 
The accord would bind other shareholders with similar claims  It differs from most shareholder derivative litigation  in that settlements often occur months or years after lawsuits are filed  A Florida pension plan  the City of Plantation Police Officers  Employees  Retirement System  is the plaintiff 
 Many lawyers try to shoot first and ask questions later   Mark Lebovitch  a partner at Bernstein  Litowitz  Berger   Grossmann representing the plaintiff  said in an interview   The board deserves credit for recognizing the benefits that our settlement proposal would create for the company  
Abercrombie directors denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle  A spokesman for the New Albany  Ohio based company had no immediate comment on Tuesday 
The changes came after Abercrombie had this year added seven new independent directors  including four to resolve a proxy battle with hedge fund Engaged Capital  and reduced Jeffries  power by splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive 
Abercrombie has had 10 straight declines in quarterly same store sales  It said on Aug  28 it would reduce its logo focused apparel business in North America to  practically nothing  while expanding other lines 
Jeffries  pay was less than  140 million from 2008 to 2013  according to court papers  because some awards did not vest or were not granted 
In the court papers  Lebovitch said the plaintiff chose an  atypical strategy  of negotiating changes quietly  rather than risk a long court battle with Abercrombie s  famously aggressive counsel  at Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom 
He also said the settlement was not collusive  and that courts in the federal circuit that includes Columbus have encouraged settlements in comparable cases 
 I don t see the incentive to settle as being any different before or after a lawsuit is actually filed   said Robert Daines  a professor at Stanford Law School and co director of its Rock Center for Corporate Governance 
The plaintiff s lawyers could receive up to  2 78 million in fees and expenses if the settlement were approved 
 We think the benefits are more significant than in virtually any derivative settlement you will find  and could justify a much larger award   Lebovitch said 
The case is City of Plantation Police Officers  Employees  Retirement System v  Jefferies et al  U S  District Court  Southern District of Ohio  No  14 01380

 We were disappointed with our third quarter results   CEO Mike Jeffries told investors on a call   The third quarter proved to be more difficult than expected     We remain in a challenging environment  

Jeffries blamed weather  a highly promotional environment around back to school season and turmoil in the teen apparel market for the company s earnings  Store traffic improved in August from a year ago but fell significantly in September and October  The company plans to improve sales by gradually displaying its logo less on its clothing and improving the fashion from classic  preppy looks to trendier  flashier looks

127566,349081,ANF,Abercrombie  ANF  Surges On Q4 Earnings Beat   Robust View,opinion,"Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   reported solid fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein top and bottom lines beat estimates  This marked the company s seventh consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise while sales topped estimates in seven out of the last eight quarters  However  earnings and sales declined year over year  owing to negative effects from a calendar shift  an additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017 and adverse currency rates Nonetheless  the company provided a robust outlook for fiscal 2019 as it expects the momentum from strong top line growth  gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage witnessed in fiscal 2018 to continue  Consequently  shares of the company soared 20 4  yesterday Further  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has surged 34 8  in the past three months  significantly outperforming the  s growth of 0 8  
 
Q4 Earnings   SalesAbercrombie posted adjusted earnings of  1 35 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 12 but down 2 2  from  1 38 in the year ago quarter  On a reported basis  the company delivered earnings per share of  1 42 compared with  1 05 in the year ago period Abercrombie   Fitch Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Net sales of  1 155 6 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 135 million but declined 3 2  from the year ago quarter s sales of  1 193 2 million  This year over year decline was mainly attributed to an adverse impact of nearly  60 million from a calendar shift and loss of an extra 53rd week in fiscal 2017 as well as negative impact of  15 million from adverse foreign currency rates  On a combined basis  these adversities affected the company s sales by nearly 6  Brand wise  net sales improved 1  to  712 9 million at Hollister while it dipped 9  to  442 7 million for the Abercrombie brand  From a geographical viewpoint  net sales grew 1  in the United States while dropped 10  in international markets Notably  digital business continued to perform well  backed by robust momentum across both brands and geographies  Digital channel sales surged 36  in the fiscal fourth quarter while reaching a milestone of crossing the  1 billion mark in annual sales Comps in DetailComps increased 3  in the fiscal fourth quarter on the back of strong cross channel traffic  owing to the positive outcome of the company s marketing and loyalty investments  Brand wise  comps were a positive 6  for Hollister but it declined 2  for Abercrombie mainly due to weakness in women s tops and dresses  Notably  this marked the sixth consecutive quarter of comps growth for the company and the ninth straight quarter of positive comps for Hollister Comps growth was mainly driven by strong performance in the United States  wherein comps improved 5   This was partly offset by 2  comps decline in international markets MarginsGross margin of 59 1  in the fiscal fourth quarter improved 70 basis points  bps  from the prior year quarter  Moreover  gross profit margin expanded 20 bps on a constant currency basis due to a slightly lower increase in average unit costs  AUC  and almost flat average unit retail  AUR  Abercrombie reported adjusted operating income of  129 7 million  reflecting a decline of 12 6  from the prior year quarter  The decline mainly stemmed from an operating expense deleverage of 30 bps  Adjusted operating margin of 11 2  contracted 120 bps from the year ago quarter  Other FinancialsAbercrombie ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of  723 1 million  and gross borrowings under its term loan agreement of  253 3 million  As of Feb 2  2019  inventories were  437 9 million  reflecting growth of 3  from the prior year period Moreover  the company returned about  122 4 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in fiscal 2018  It bought back 2 9 million shares in the fiscal year On Feb 22  the company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share on the Class A shares  This is payable on Mar 18 to shareholders of record as of Mar 8 At the end of the fiscal first quarter  Abercrombie expects inventory to be at a low single digit as it leverages ongoing transformation initiatives to improve long term inventory productivity Store UpdateIn the fiscal fourth quarter  the company opened six stores  including four Hollister and 2 Abercrombie outlets  Further  it closed nearly 24 stores in the United States  which comprised 15 Abercrombie and nine Hollister stores The company has been closely working on its goals of optimizing store fleet  which led to significant store closures in the past eight years  However  it takes these closures as an opportunity to improve store productivity by reducing store occupancy costs  Consequently  the company closed about 29 stores in fiscal 2018  reducing total square footage by 2   This aided a low single digit improvement in productivity per square foot from the fiscal 2017 level As part of its continued focus on optimizing store fleet  Abercrombie identified lease expirations for nearly 50  of its store base in the United States in the next two years  As a result  the company plans to close up to 40 stores in fiscal 2019  after evaluation  Simultaneously  it expects to continue investing in enhancing store experiences  mainly through new store prototypes  remodeled stores and right sizes  In fiscal 2019  the company plans to deliver about 85 new experiences  including mainly remodels OutlookAbercrombie continues to anticipate strong top line growth  gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage in fiscal 2019  which should drive operating margin expansion  Notably  the company witnessed operating expense leverage of 130 bps in fiscal 2018  resulting in operating margin expansion of 100 bps  Expecting this momentum to continue  it believes that it is on track to deliver on the previously stated adjusted operating margin expansion target for fiscal 2020 For fiscal 2019  the company estimates sales to increase 2 4   driven by low single digit comps growth and contribution from new stores  However  unfavorable foreign currency rate is expected to mar top line results by nearly  15 million  which is likely to occur in the fiscal first quarter The company expects gross margin to improve slightly from 60 2  recorded in fiscal 2018  The upside will likely stem from higher AUR  including adverse currency impacts  partly offset by higher AUCs  However  the guidance excludes effects of potential rise in China tariffs on apparel  To play it safe  the company estimates reducing sourcing of China goods to the United States  It expects to reduce the inflow from China to less than 20  in fiscal 2019 compared with about 25  in fiscal 2018 Operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are expected to increase nearly 2  from  2 03 billion of adjusted operating expenses recorded in fiscal 2018  Furthermore  it expects effective tax rate to be in the mid to upper 20s range Additionally  the company envisions capital expenditure of roughly  200 million for fiscal 2019 marking an increase from  152 million in fiscal 2018  This will likely include  120 million for stores  and nearly  80 million for digital and technology investments For the fiscal first quarter  the company anticipates sales to be flat from the prior year quarter  This includes an adverse impact of nearly  15 million from negative currency translations  Comps are anticipated to remain flat or increase up to 2   Gross margin is likely to be flat or up slightly from 50 5  reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 Operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are estimated to be flat to adjusted operating expenses of  482 million in first quarter fiscal 2018  Effective tax rate is anticipated in the mid

127581,349096,ANF,One Year Down  Not Much Has Changed In Bangladesh Factories,news,"By    A year after the garment factory collapse in Bangladesh that took the lives of 1 129 people triggered a debate about the developed world s responsibility to protect the safety and health of workers supplying it with low priced clothes  not much has changed despite a few signs of measurable progress 
In the wake of the accident the Bangladeshi government announced its commitment to ensuring safe workplaces in the country s single most important industry  employing over 4 million people  each earning about  9 a week  And some multinational companies  under attack for ignoring safety concerns for the sake of cheap labor  vowed to aid victims  families and fund efforts to audit factories to make sure they comply with fire safety and structural integrity codes 
Amid the rubble of the eight story Rana Plaza building  rescue workers found garment labels from some of the world s biggest retailers including Italy s Benetton Group  Wal Mart Stores Inc  NYSE WMT from the United States  Bonmarche Holdings PLC  LON BON  of the UK  El Corte Ingl s S A   based in Madrid 

Those efforts have a decidedly mixed record  Injured victims  most of whom have been unemployed or underemployed since the accident  are only just now starting to see compensation payments  Hundreds of factories are being inspected for workplace safety violations but they represent just a small share of all the factories involved in the supply chain  many of which are used by unauthorized subcontractors  It remains difficult to track which companies are helping fund such efforts  due to the voluntary nature of their involvement 

 There are three important questions that I think have not been completely answered yet   said Arvind Ganesan  director of Human Rights Watch s Business and Human Rights Division   One  who is contributing to improve conditions and how  secondly  is it readily apparent to the public what s going on  and three  are conditions actually improving  
Two separate organizations were formed after the tragedy to help upgrade the factories but it is difficult to assess their efforts because they are ongoing 
The Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety has over 150 signatories including major European brands like Sweden s clothing company H M Hennes   Mauritz  HMb ST  and French hypermarket chain Carrefour  CARR PAR  and 15 U S  based retailers  including Abercrombie   Fitch Co  NYSE ANF  based in New Albany  Ohio  and Fruit of the Loom  Inc  of Bowling Green  Ky 

The accord is a legally binding arrangement between international and local trade unions  labor rights groups and companies with the participation of the International Labour Organization  ILO   The accord collects funds from companies based on the volume of garments they source from the country  up to  500 000 a year  The money pays for factoty inspections and to train local engineers  The group says it s deployed 38  structural  fire and safety expert teams to assess about 1 500 facilities by the end of September

127614,349129,ANF,Casey s  Polaris  Telenav  Applied Materials  Macy s  Zumiez And Abercrombie   Fitch Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   February 20  2019    Telenav   NASDAQ TNAV   as the Bull of the Day  Applied Materials   NYSE M   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Macy s  Inc    NYSE M    Zumiez   NASDAQ ZUMZ   and Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Telenavcaught my eye as it is just the type of stock that I look for   My search all starts with the Zacks Rank  and when I see a stock with the best Zacks Rank I am going to take a deeper look   TNAV has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  due to a good earnings history and solid earnings estimate revisions Earnings HistoryLately  I when I look at an earnings history I key on just the last four quarters   A lot has changed just in this calendar year  so I am putting less and less weight on earnings that are more than a year back For TNAV the earnings history over the last four quarters is really looking good   They are four for four in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  which is also a good thing   Drilling deeper I see something that I really like Let s start with the report that came four quarters ago  a 1 cent beat for a 1 6  positive earnings surprise   Then a 4 cent beat for a 6 8  positive earnings surprise   That was followed by an 8 cent beat for a 36  positive earnings surprise and finally the most recent quarter saw a 6 cent beat for a 50  positive earnings surprise You can see that the size of positive earnings surprise just keeps getting bigger   At the same time  the loss per share has moved from  0 60 to  0 06   That tells me that profitability is right around the corner Estimate RevisionsWhen I see a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  I am confident that there will be some strong positive moves in the earnings estimates   The Zacks Rank is heavily influenced by recent estimate changes  so let s look at the number for TNAV I see the losses shrinking for this quarter as well as next  each by a penny or two   The real move is the fiscal 2019 number that has moved from a loss of 48 cents to a loss of 43 cents   That is the good news  There is the fiscal 2020 number that is a bit odd to me   I see that loss increasing  and that isn t the type of thing we like to see   This could be a case of limited visibility on the part of analysts as we are a good year and a half out from that time frame ValuationWe tend to lean on the PE  trailing and forward  but in this instance we will not have that crutch   Instead  we look at price to book to see a great multiple of 2 4x and then another reasonable price to sales multiple of 1 7x   Both of those metrics are good  but then I look at margins While there has been some really big  positive move in margins  I see a  48  operating margin and  50  net margin   So it is not a sure thing here at all   Yes  those margin levels were in the  80 range not too long ago  so there is improvement  but still  those large numbers are enough to give me pause  Applied Materialsrecently reported earnings that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate   The problem is they guided next quarter below the consensus and when the consensus falls  so does the Zacks Rank   Let s take a look at the details in this Bear of the Day article DescriptionApplied Materials offers a diverse array of flexible service solutions to increase equipment uptime and factory efficiency  enabling fabs to focus on chip production  while lowering cost per wafer  The Company s display service portfolio has been developed to address the customers  specific needs and offers a variety of services that provide support for every maintenance activity on an Applied Materials display tool  Applied Materials is committed to the success of the customers throughout the product and factory life cycle and their crystalline silicon solar  c Si  services enable the customers to focus on increasing cell efficiency and meeting factory goals Recent ReportI see the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 79 by  0 02 for a 2 5  positive earnings surprise   That is good to see  but Wall Street cares more about what you will do than what you have done  The company guided next quarter EPS of  0 62 to  0 70 and that was well below the  0 78 estimate at the time   In fact  the number for this quarter was  0 82 60 days ago and came in by a penny as of 30 days ago   A week ahead of earnings the number was  0 78 so you can see estimates were softening ahead of the report The next quarter has also seen a shift lower in estimates with the Zacks Consensus Estimate dropping from  0 90 to  0 78 over the last 90 days Implied Earnings GrowthThe full year earnings estimate for fiscal 2019 has dropped from  3 64 to  3 23  and that will send you to the low end of the Zacks Rank   There is hope though  as fiscal 2020 is looking for  3 94 in EPS so there is some implied earnings growth ahead for AMAT Factors Likely to Decide Macy s  M  Earnings Fate Macy s  Inc is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 26  before the opening bell  In the last reported quarter  this department store retailer delivered a positive earnings surprise of 92 9   The company s bottom line has also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by average of 37 9  in the trailing four quarters How Are Estimates Faring The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is pegged at  2 65  which reflects a sharp decline from  2 82 recorded in the year ago quarter  We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues currently stands at  8 461 million  exhibiting year over year decline of roughly 2 4   In the last reported quarter  the company s net sales grew 2 3  For fiscal 2018  the consensus estimates for top and bottom lines are pegged at  24 9 billion and  4 01  respectively Factors at PlayDismal Holiday Sales Numbers to Impact Q4 PerformanceIn spite of taking a slew of measures such as Backstage  Vendor Direct  Store Pickup  Loyalty Program and Growth50 stores  Macy s posted weaker than expected sales figures for the holiday season  which coincides with the fourth quarter  Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis increased 1 1  during November and December period combined  while on an owned basis  comparable sales inched up 0 7   However  digital business remained robust and recorded double digit growth Management informed that Macy s kick started the season on a solid note primarily during Black Friday and the following Cyber Week but lost momentum in the mid December period only to regain some pace during Christmas Trimmed Forecast Raises ConcernFollowing an unimpressive holiday sales report  Macy s lowered fiscal 2018 view  The company now expects comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to increase about 2   down from the prior expectation of 2 3 2 5  growth  Net sales are anticipated to remain flat year over year compared with earlier expectation of a 0 3 0 7  increase  The company now envisions earnings in the band of  3 95  4 00 per share  down from its prior view of  4 10  4 30 Other Factors to NoteCertainly  Macy s has been focusing on price optimization  inventory management  merchandise planning and private label offering  and developing omni channel capabilities and online order fulfillment centers  The company added a new feature to its mobile app called Mobile Checkout and also bought minority stake in b8ta  a technology retailer The aforementioned endeavors are viewed as steps to safeguard against industry challenges and stiff competition from online retailers  Management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to increase on account of strategic investments  However  any significant increase in the same may hurt margins and in turn the bottom line What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macy s is likely to beat estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Macy s has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  7 37   which makes surprise prediction difficult Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat

Major consumer trends  such as premiumization  health and wellness  along with demographic changes in the population  are causing a segment mix shift within beer  This industry trend is compelling most of the beer companies to diversify and include newer drinks or innovate the beer range by lowering the alcohol content As mentioned earlier  AB InBev is not immune to this turmoil in the beer segment as it holds the top spot in the beer industry  controlling about one third of the global beer market  Notably  AB InBev s U S  revenues fell 1 4  in the first nine months of 2018  mainly attributed to lower volumes as its flagship Budweiser and Bud Light brands continued to lose market share  In the third quarter  Bud Light and Budweiser lost 90 basis points  bps  and 35 bps of the total market share  respectively Consequently  the stock has decreased 20 8  in the past six months  wider than the  s decline of 8 8  
Despite the bleak recent results  the company s three global brands like Budweiser  Corona and Stella Artois continue to reflect strength  Consolidated revenues for the global brands improved 7 7  globally and increased 10 6  outside home markets in the third quarter  Budweiser gains from strong revenue growth outside of the United States and sustained momentum from its global sponsorship of the FIFA World Cup  Moreover  expansion in new markets such as Colombia  Nigeria and South Africa is contributing to its performance Stella Artois is witnessing growth from both established and expanded markets  The strength in global brands reflects the company s potential to grow  backed by improving trends in key markets and continued premiumization in the majority of its markets Though AB InBev sees volatility in certain key markets  it anticipates delivering strong top line and EBITDA growth for the year  backed by solid brand performance and robust commercial plans  Driven by the focus on category development  the company expects net revenue per hl growth to exceed inflation while costs are expected to come below inflation  Moreover  premiumization and revenue management initiatives are likely to aid revenue per hl growth Furthermore  the company expects to witness accelerated growth in the second half of 2018  driven by the extension of learnings from its category expansion framework and best practices across markets  It believes that it is well positioned to drive category growth across its diverse geographic footprint on an ongoing basis  given the strong portfolio of global and high end brands  AB InBev envisions dividend growth to be modest in the near term due to increased importance of deleveraging What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict earnings beat for AB InBev this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  AB InBev s Earnings ESP of 0 00  and Zacks Rank  4  Sell  make surprise prediction inconclusive As it is  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat Turning Point Brands  Inc    NYSE TPB   has an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Foot Locker Inc    NYSE FL   has an Earnings ESP of  2 25  and a Zacks Rank of 2 Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   has an Earnings ESP of  0 94  and a Zacks Rank  2 Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2019-02-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/factors-likely-to-decide-ab-inbevs-bud-fate-in-q4-earnings-200391725,200391725

127656,349171,ANF,5 Stocks In Limelight Due To Recent Broker Rating Upgrades,opinion,A high proportion of companies have reported better than expected earnings per share in the current reporting cycle Generally  an earnings beat by a company leads to an appreciation in its stock price  Given this backdrop  investors would like to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns However  with a plethora of earnings reports flooding the market during the reporting cycle  pinpointing outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   for an investor  The proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed to be experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far as the field of investing is concerned Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Brokers  irrespective of their type  attend company conference calls presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  buy  sell or hold a stock   In view of their expertise and profound understanding of stocks and the investing world  it is a no brainer that investors should pay heed to broker advice to generate the maximum from their portfolios Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers follow the stocks in their coverage closely  they revise their earnings estimates on a stock after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Their action is certainly not arbitrary or illogical  Thus  estimate revisions serve as an important guide regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings results often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Value the Top lineTo design a winning strategy  it is not wise to consider only the bottom line  In fact  according to some market watchers  a top line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than a bottom line outperformance  under some circumstances  Therefore  to make the strategy full proof  one needs to address top line concerns as well  We have considered the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation

127764,349279,ANF,Can Growth Endeavors Aid Wolverine s  WWW  Revival In 2019 ,opinion,"Shares of Wolverine World Wide  Inc    NYSE WWW   have not only declined but also underperformed the  in the past six months  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has lost 7 8  in the said time frame compared with the industry s decline of 5 1   This can be attributable to the company s sluggish sales trend for the past few quarters 

 
Notably  Wolverine has been witnessing dismal sales trends over the last five quarters  mainly due to change in quarterly calendars  negative impacts of store closures and portfolio changes made in early 2017  Some of these factors also led to a drop in revenues during the third quarter of 2018 
The top line declined 3 9  to  558 6 million in the quarter  owing to decline in all three segments  Moreover  sales at the company s Boston Group and Heritage Group have declined in all the three quarters of 2018  
Further  the company is exposed to significant currency headwinds  Additionally  stiff competition is a concern  
Efforts to Revive the Stock
Wolverine boasts a wide portfolio of owned and licensed brands of casual as well as athletic footwear and apparel  We note that two of the company s biggest brands  namely Merrell and Wolverine  have been gaining traction lately  Further  the company plans to strengthen its brand portfolio through innovation and expansion of its brands to newer geographies and platforms  
Moreover  the company is riding well on its strong international presence  Going ahead  the company plans to add strategic resources to strengthen its regional teams  especially in the emerging regions of Asia Pacific such as China  These efforts are likely to help achieve high single digit growth in revenues from its international business in 2018 
Apart from these  Wolverine has been progressing well with its Way Forward transformation initiative  a strategic platform aimed at driving growth and profitability amid a competitive market scenario  In fact  a significant portion of gross margin growth during the first  second and third quarters of 2018 was driven by this initiative 
We note that during the first quarter  the company stepped into the next phase of the Way Forward initiative   Global Growth Agenda  The agenda encompasses three key strategies  namely Powerful Product Creation Engine  Digital Direct Offense and International Expansion  Incremental investments toward such growth initiatives are expected to be  40  45 million for 2018  Out of this  approximately 45  will be directed toward the creation of powerful product development  
Moreover  the company focuses on its fast growing e commerce space  Efforts in this respect include enhancing social presence  better digital advertisement manoeuvres  and better implementation and management of consumer database  Further  the company has allocated approximately  15 million of incremental investments from the Global Growth Agenda toward digital advancements  In fact  Wolverine is witnessing solid e commerce growth  with 25  improvement in this business in the third quarter 
All said  we expect these above mentioned strategies to offset the challenges faced by the company and get it back on track in the near future

127805,349320,ANF,5 Top Rising P E Stocks To Enjoy Solid Gains,opinion,"Betting on bargain stocks that have a low price to earnings  P E  ratio is a convenient investment approach  The perception is that the lower the P E  the higher is the value of the stock   This inference is drawn on the simple logic that a stock s current market price does not justify  is not equivalent to  its higher earnings and therefore has room to run 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  it means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings  This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal   
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see  
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 53 
Here are five out of the 53 stocks 
Abercrombie   Fitch Company    NYSE ANF     The company is into retailing of apparel and shoes  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 18   and sports a Zacks Rank  1 
Xcel Brands Inc    NASDAQ XELB     This is a brand management company  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 18

127806,349321,ANF,Market Cycles Suggest Abercrombie Setting Up To Pop And Drop By End Of Q1,opinion,"Summary

Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  rose on Friday morning  trading 2 5  higher after stock analyst Wedbush raised its price target for the clothing retailer 
Our view is that the stock will continue higher only to fail in its intermediate resistance zone 


Wedbush Securities raised its price target for ANF from  17 to  19  However  the stock analyst was a day late  as the shares closed at  19 28 on the previous trading day 
In analyzing the market cycles for ANF  the present rising phase is substandard  with a high  so far  only in the first week off its recent low  Yet we believe it will continue to move higher before failing in the resistance zone between  21 70 22 50 
After that  we see the stock declining again  testing the  15 level by March of 2019  The megaphone suggests that the stock is trying to make a longer term bottom

127820,349335,ANF,Here s Why You Should Hold American Eagle  AEO  Stock Now,opinion,"American Eagle Outfitters Inc    NYSE AEO   is a strong contender for the top spot  backed by its overwhelming comparable store sales  comps  performance and surprise history  Driven by strategic initiatives and ability to boost market share through strong brands  and compelling merchandise  the company continues to be in investors  good books However  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s stock has been volatile lately due to higher costs as well as a shift of the 2018 retail calendar  which should continue to weigh on near term results  While the stock has moved decreased 3 3  year to date  it represents an outperformance compared with the  s decline of 17 2  
 
Here are some factors indicating that the American Eagle stock still holds potential for growth Omni Channel Growth to Drive Top LineAmerican Eagle is striving to develop the omni channel platform by enhancing its digital portals while also investing in store fleet  Backed by its investments in omni channel capabilities  both store and digital channels reported solid sales in third quarter fiscal 2018  Digital business contributed about 27  to sales while in store comps improved 6   In fact  this was the company s 15th straight quarter of double digit e commerce growth and fourth consecutive quarter of positive in store comps Trends in brick and mortar stores continued to improve as both AE and Aerie stores reported positive in store comps  This makes it clear that a winning marketing strategy in retail is providing the best combination of digital and physical store experiences Aerie Segment Holds PotentialContinued strength in the Aerie business helped American Eagle gain a strong footing in the retail space  Notably  comps for the Aerie brand improved 32  in the fiscal third quarter  marking the 16th straight quarter of double digit growth  driven by significant momentum in all areas of the business  Aerie has evolved into a lifestyle brand  and remains focused on expanding market share and rapidly growing customer base After the success of its core intimates offerings  the brand is rapidly gaining share in the innovative apparel market  with the body positive movement  The Aerie brand is a key growth engine for AEO and remains on track to reach the next brand milestone of achieving  1 billion in sales Robust Q3 Performance  Strong ViewAmerican Eagle s third quarter fiscal 2018 results reflected significant progress in all areas  reporting solid sales and earnings per share growth year over year  Earnings topped estimates  marking the third straight quarter of positive surprise  Though sales missed estimates in the fiscal third quarter  the company reported positive sales surprise in three of the last four quarters  Further  sales reached the  1 billion mark for the first time in the reported quarter  Solid sales growth was driven by well executed fall season for both AE and Aerie brands in both physical and digital channels  with less promotional activity American Eagle Outfitters  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

The Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock further came under pressure following the company s third quarter fiscal 2018 results  wherein the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Further  slashed fiscal 2018 view and soft fourth quarter projection were also not well perceived by investors 
Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been witnessing a downtrend  We note that estimates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 have moved south by 48 cents and 29 cents to  7 73 and  9 29  respectively  in the past 30 days  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  the estimates have tumbled 59 cents to  2 11  The company reported fiscal third quarter adjusted earnings of  3 07 per share  which fell short of the consensus mark by a penny This children s apparel  footwear  and accessories retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping  The company faces stiff competition from department stores as well as other discount stores  We believe that unhealthy price competition to gain market share and drive footfall might weigh on its results Management now anticipates adjusted earnings in the band of  7 69  7 79 per share and total net sales in the range of  1 955  1 960 billion for fiscal 2018  down from the prior guided range  Also  the company envisions fiscal fourth quarter net sales and earnings in the range of  547  552 million and  2 07  2 17 per share  respectively  down from  570 million and  2 52 per share recorded in the prior year period  Further  management expects low single digit increase in comparable retail sales versus prior expectation of mid single digit growth Moreover  Children s Place has slashed fiscal 2018 adjusted operating margin guidance to 7 7 7 8  from the prior guided range of 8 5 8 7   The new projection also compares unfavorably with 9 6  recorded in the prior year  The tepid outlook takes into account higher fulfillment expenses to support stronger demand in digital channels and shipping costs due to a shift from retail stores to online Nevertheless  the company s multi year strategic growth initiatives including digital transformation  product  alternate channels of distribution and fleet optimization bode well  Management expects digital penetration to increase to 27  of net sales from 23  in fiscal 2018

127847,349362,ANF,Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF  Shocks Industry With A Solid Earnings Beat ,opinion,"Recently  American retailer Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   shocked investors and the market by posting better than expected earnings and beating on the top and bottom line   Although the company faced trouble and concern with its former CEO  it has proved to turn its business around and take the right steps moving forward  Let s take a closer look at how A F has performed throughout the year and its outlook for the future 
Mike Jeffries as CEO 
Before he was pulled from the board and his position  Mike Jeffries was the CEO of Abercrombie   Fitch until 2014  However  during his time with the company  he was considered one of the most controversial CEOs in the retail industry  He continued to shock customers  investors and fellow retailers with his bizarre business philosophies and the approach he took towards the brand  Throughout his 22 years as CEO  he made many remarks about sexualizing the brand image of A F  This was shown through the shirtless models welcoming customers at the front of A F stores  only allowing people  who looked the brand  to work there  and using provocative images of young people for marketing material 
Jeffries was never shy about posing the brand as something only the  cool  kids could wear  He stated his brand was exclusionary and should only be worn by those cool  popular kids in school  The company suffered a 13 quarter streak of negative or flat growth sales in 2015  due to faulty marketing and lack of consumer interest  When Jeffries suddenly  retired   the company needed a serious reboot  of their brand and values 
Abercrombie s Current Climate
Since the current CEO  Fran Horowitz  joined the company in 2017  A F has started to see a turnaround  The problem of dim lit stores and the overpowering smell of cologne in every corner has slowly started to die down  From the time Horowitz joined the company  A F s stock has surged almost 70    
Shares of the company increased 25  after Abercrombie   Fitch posted adjusted earnings of  0 35  on revenues of  821 million  compared to  0 15 in the year prior s quarter  The company also posted 3  growth of comparable sales on top of 4  from last year  The company started off with a strong holiday season and expects to keep that momentum going  Since the company has shifted its focus to what the consumer wants  instead of what the brand wants  it has seen success in both A F and Hollister stores 
According to   the company has proven that change is working  The most important thing is the clothing  according to A F designer Aaron Levine  At one point  A F s clothing was meant for petite individuals who looked the part of the brand  Hence  consumers stopped shopping there because there was only one target audience and one demographic that the company was selling to 
Horowitz has taken the company back to its roots  supporting the heritage and valuing the consumers more now  It is important to understand that change doesn t occur all of a sudden  and if A F wants to fully revive their brand  they must continue to find ways to do that and not stop now 
Outlook
With the direction that Horowitz is leading the company in  it seems as though it could be viable in the long run  The new generation of A F customers will continue to keep the company profitable and successful  if they continue to stay on the right track in terms of branding  clothing and values

company expects inventory to be flat to up low single digit as it leverages ongoing transformation initiatives to improve long term inventory productivity Store UpdateIn the fiscal third quarter  the company delivered 28 new store experiences  including 11 store openings  five right sizing and 12 remodels Management expects to deliver about 70 new store experiences in fiscal 2018  which include new store prototypes  remodeled stores and right sizes  Moreover  it now expects to shut down fewer stores in fiscal 2018 due to improved performance and lease negotiations  The company anticipates about 40 store closures in the fiscal year  mostly in the United States  compared with 60 closures expected earlier OutlookAbercrombie notes that the momentum witnessed in the fiscal third quarter continued into the fourth quarter  reflected by a robust performance at the start of the holiday season   during the period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday  In November  the company witnessed strong double digit growth on singles day on T Mall and record sales during the aforementioned holiday period Consequently  the company expects to deliver on its previously stated outlook for fiscal 2018  It anticipates strong top line growth  gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage in fiscal 2018  The company also outlined its view for the fiscal fourth quarter For the fiscal fourth quarter  the company anticipates sales to decline in a mid single digit  This includes an adverse impact of nearly  60 million from the additional week in fiscal 2017 and about  15 million from negative currency translations  Comps are anticipated to grow in a low single digit  Gross margin is likely to be flat or up slightly from the fiscal 2017 level of 58 4  Operating expenses  excluding other operating income  are estimated to decline 1 2  from adjusted operating expenses of  561 million in fiscal 2017  The decline is likely to stem from lower expenses due to the calendar shift and absence of 2017 s extra 53rd week related foreign currency rates alongside reduced compensation expenses  This will be partly negated by continued investments in marketing and transformation initiatives  Other operating income is anticipated to be  2 million  with effective tax rate in the mid to upper 20s range For fiscal 2018  the company continues to estimate both comps and sales to be up 2 4   Favorable foreign currency rate is expected to contribute nearly  10 million to net sales  However  loss of an additional week is expected to hurt sales by  40 million in fiscal 2018 The company expects gross margin to improve slightly from 59 7  recorded in fiscal 2017  The upside will stem from higher average unit retail  including currency gains  reduced promotions and a slight decline in average unit costs GAAP operating expenses are now expected to increase nearly 2  from  2 billion adjusted operating expenses recorded in fiscal 2017  Earlier  the company projected a 2 5  increase

127859,349374,ANF,In Search Of An Earnings Beat  Play These Top 5 Stocks,opinion,"Investors specifically look for stocks that have the ability to beat market expectations before an earnings season  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to bet on stocks that are high quality in nature 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
Meanwhile  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when arriving at an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own as well as market s expectations  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks That Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst  sending the stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors usually believe that the company will apply the same secret formula to beat earning in its next release as well 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A few other criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to 15 
Here are five of the 15 stocks 
Abercrombie   Fitch Company   NYSE ANF    This company has launched an integrated campaign for its Abercrombie   Fitch brand  marking the start of the holiday season  The stock comes from a top ranked Zacks industry  top 27    It carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  is set to release its FQ1 18 earnings Friday before the open  Estimize predicts an EPS of   0 73 while Wall Street predicts an EPS of   0 79 although this is negative it is still well above last year s EPS of   0 91  Currently  the Estimize community expects to see a revenue result of  704 03M  which is a little higher than Wall Street s prediction of  698 26M in revenue

127885,349400,ANF,Skeptics Swarm Abercrombie   Fitch Stock Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Clothing retailer Abercrombie   Fitch Company  NYSE ANF  is slated to report first quarter earnings before the market opens tomorrow  Abercrombie stock is down 7 1  at  23 91 at last check  pressured by a post earnings drop for sector peer American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO   However  ANF shares have a history of positive earnings reactions  which could help send the retail stock on its next leg higher 
In fact  ANF stock has closed higher in the session following each of the company s last five reports  averaging a gain of 15 2   Widening the scope  the stock has averaged a one day post earnings swing of 15 7  over the past two years  regardless of direction  in line with what the options market is pricing this time around  per data from Trade Alert 
Another post earnings move to the upside could have analysts re evaluating their ratings on the equity  Fourteen firms currently follow ANF  11 of which maintain a  hold  or  strong sell  rating    leaving the door wide open for more upgrades  Further  the stock s average 12 month price target of  22 54 stands at a more than 5  discount to present trading levels 

The retail stock is heavily shorted  too  with the 14 6 million shares sold short representing nearly 22  of the available float  At ANF s average daily trading volume  it would take more than a week for shorts to cover their bearish bets    meaning there s ample fuel for a short squeeze rally

3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  after pulling back from the resistance on the top of the channel it s been wedging  and it may need some more days of doing that  But I wanted to show you that the reversal on Tuesday  up 1 08  or 6   to 19 00  on 3 7 million shares  may lead to something further  However  it s got to get above 20 with energy to get to the 22 1 2 23 1 2 zone 
Tillys Inc  NYSE TLYS  broke out a couple days ago  Tuesday  it s extended  up 51 cents  or 3   to 17 56  on 265 903 shares  I think the stock is headed to 19  Beyond that  I m looking for the stock to make it up to 22 1 2  in that range

127923,349438,ANF,The Retail Sector Is Back  Play The Recovery With These 3 Stocks,opinion,"Recent reports of the retail sector s death have been greatly exaggerated  The sector s biggest exchange traded fund SPDR S P Retail  NYSE XRT  last week managed to reach its highest level in almost four months 
Indeed  the sector has been in full fledged recovery mode lately  even as analysts repeatedly warned of the demise of traditional bricks and mortar retailers  a result of the  as consumers spend more and more time shopping online 

The SPDR S P Retail ETF  which is up around 5  since the start of April  offers the most popular way to play the wider retail sector as it tracks a broad based  equal weighted index of 84 stocks in the sector 
Why The Recent Push Higher 
A strong jobs market  booming consumer confidence and higher take home pay in the wake of US tax reductions are buoying American consumers  ability and willingness to spend 
 Households are in good spirits and are spending in the new season   James Knightley  chief international economist at ING Bank  wrote in a recent note   Employment is rising  wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people s pockets  
Commerce Department figures released on May 15 showed that US retail sales rose 0 3  in April  as bigger after tax paychecks helped compensate for rising fuel costs  signaling consumer demand was off to a firm start this quarter 
Nine of 13 major retail categories showed advances last month  led by the biggest jump in sales at apparel stores since March of last year  Increased receipts were also evident at furniture merchants  building materials outlets and department stores 
The results add to the expectation that consumer spending  the biggest part of the economy  will rebound from its first quarter weak patch 
Another factor that has been aiding retail shares lately has been reduced concern that a trade war between the United States and China could break out imminently 
Since the possibility of a trade war came into focus  retail shares have been under pressure on worries that the goods they produce in China could become unsustainably expensive  If Chinese authorities made it too costly to produce goods there  US retailers could charge consumers for the difference 
But over the weekend  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US China trade war was  on hold   Investors took these comments as a sign that trade tensions between the world s two largest economies would reach a market friendly solution 
Finally   is creating tailwinds for the sector and boosting consumer spending  Generation X and millennials  who represented around 70  of the US working population in 2015  are now entering their peak earning years 
3 Stocks Poised To Outperform
Many retailers are currently attracting strong buying interest  with speculators betting on a surge in US consumer spending  driven by tax cuts and receding trade tensions  This buying wave should continue into the third quarter  setting the stage for a mid year rally that could lift many stocks in the sector to multi year highs 
Below we take a look at three stocks poised to outperform in the months ahead  Our list includes one major department store  a yoga gear maker and a mall based teen apparel retailer 
1  Macy s
After a two year bear market  which prompted many to write off the sector completely  major department stores finally bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2017  with Macy s  NYSE M  leading the way back  The stock is up 32  year to date versus the S P 500 s 2  return 

The stock surged more than 10  on May 16  its best day since December 17  2008  after Macy s reported better than expected quarterly and same store sales  the result of strong international tourism spending  a new loyalty program and a greater assortment of products offered in stores 
The company said all three of its divisions   Macy s  Bloomingdale s and Bluemercury   exceeded expectations during the first quarter of fiscal 2018   The quarter was good every month   in fact  every week   Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said on a call with analysts   Spirits are up  
That prompted the department store retailer to raise its full year profit forecast  Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said on the post earnings call the company saw double digit growth in its online business  which should bode well going into the latter half of the year 
Macy s just recently announced its acquisition of Story  a New York based concept shop  and will be bringing on Story s founder  Rachel Shechtman  as  brand experience officer  to steer the company s creative strategy  The retailer is also in the midst of rolling out mobile checkout to all of its locations by year end and is adding a virtual reality shopping experience to some stores 
Wall Street firm Susquehanna raised its rating to positive from neutral for Macy s shares earlier this week  predicting the retailer will report earnings above expectations this fiscal year   We now believe that Macy s has upside potential to conservative earnings guidance as the fundamental strength from current initiatives are carrying through  which should deliver a parade of beat and raise quarterly earnings reports though FY18   analyst Bill Dreher said in a note to clients on Monday 
Dreher raised his price target for Macy s shares to  43 from  25  representing 24  upside to Monday s close 
Traditional retailing may still be under pressure from online retailers such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   but Macy s results showed there s still plenty of hope for traditional outlets as the sector evolves and transforms itself 
2  Lululemon
Canadian athletic apparel maker Lululemon Athletica  NASDAQ LULU  has been acting like a true market leader lately  rising even on days when the broader market pulls back  The stock  which is trading near all time highs  has rallied as much as 34  since the company reported blowout earnings growth on March 27 

The yoga gear maker posted a surprisingly robust fourth quarter profit and forecast further growth in the first quarter  as strong sales from a revamped e commerce platform and a surge of traffic at permanent and holiday pop up stores drove results  Its next earnings release is on May 31 after the market close  Analysts expect the company to earn 46 cents per share on revenue of  616 3 million  The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was 32 cents on revenue of  520 3 million 
Lululemon  which popularized  athleisure wear  by turning pricey women s yoga apparel into mainstream fashion  is currently continuing its CEO search following the abrupt resignation of Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin in February on undisclosed charges of misconduct  Chairman Glenn Murphy  who became executive chairman on Potdevin s departure  said recently that the company has met with  a number of great candidates   but so far no decision has been taken 
Investors don t seem too worried just yet though  as the stock continues to outperform its sports apparel rivals  including Nike  NYSE NKE  and Under Armour  NYSE UA  
Looking ahead  LULU  which historically has been a brand focused more on women  has so far been successful with its efforts to court more male shoppers  The company now has a sales goal of  1 billion for its men s apparel business  and  4 billion in total sales  by 2020  which should act as a growth engine going forward 
3  Abercrombie   Fitch
Teen retailer Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  has enjoyed an impressive turnaround recently  after the brand fell out of favor with mainstream consumers and e commerce and fast fashion took over the space 
The stock  which dropped below  10 in 2017  has made a solid comeback  climbing to nearly  30 per share a couple of months ago  trading at  25 45 as of last night s close  ANF shares have gained more than 21  since reporting fourth quarter earnings and sales which beat expectations on March 7  Year to date  the stock is up about 45  

The retailer reported net income of  74 2 million  or  1 05 per share  up from  48 8 million  or 71 cents per share  for the same period last year  Sales were  1 19 billion  up from  1 04 billion last year 
More importantly  same store sales grew 9   with lifestyle brand Hollister  which ANF owns  up 11  and the namesake brand up 5  for the quarter  the chain s first quarterly comp store sales gain in 23 quarters  stretching back to 2011  The turnaround can be attributed to Fran Horowitz  the 53 year old executive who was named CEO in February 2017 after a successful stint at the company s red hot Hollister nameplate 
Horowitz is pushing forward with a marketing strategy that seems to be the opposite of the one used by Mike Jeffries  her predecessor as CEO  which was responsible for the sexualized image of the company  Under Horowitz  A F launched a gender neutral line for its kids stores 
The stores have also been revamped and are integrated with technology  The overpowering perfume  which used to permeate the stores  has also been modified to a fresher  cleaner fragrance

127945,349460,ANF,Retailers Look To Counter Margin Woes  Will Efforts Pay Off ,opinion,With growing technology  digital shopping has expanded by leaps and bounds  taking a major share from traditional brick and mortar stores  This has led to the rise of Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    which caters to a larger share of the retail selling today  making traditional retailers cautious Changing customer preferences still remain the key reason behind the transforming  sector  In fact  customers prefer shopping from their homes  easy returns policy  options for trials at stores  speedy delivery and many more  Consequently  increasing troubles for retailers  who are trying to strike a balance between online and offline stores  and provide customer with a seamless experience  In view of these headwinds  the Retail sector currently has a Rank  14  placing it at the bottom 13  of the 16 Zacks sectors In a bid to woo customers and boost profitability  retailers are trying every means from enhancing its website  to remodeling or closing underperforming stores  augmenting delivery and payment systems  building new alliances  and perking up investments However  the desired change is coming at the cost of declining margins  with higher investments to enhance presence and increased operating costs being the main culprits  Increased promotional activities  higher spending toward online portal and lower traffic at stores are some other issues denting retailers  margins  Although retailers are resorting to strict cost cutting measures like increasing operational efficacy at production  enhancing supply chain networks  revising the cost structures among others to lift margins  a turnaround on this front may take time With that said  let s look at few retailers that are grappling with margin issues  initiatives to boost margins and how are they placed Starting with Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF    we note that this retailer of premium  high quality apparel has been witnessing strained margins since last four quarters  The company s gross margin contracted 90 basis points  bps   80 bps  160 bps and 130 bps in the fourth  third  second and first quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  Soft traffic at stores  higher promotional expenses and greater investments to improve profitability has been primarily weighing on the company s margins  However  management is taking initiatives to reduce costs by streamlining its operations  close underperforming stores  focusing more on Direct to Consumer  DTC  model and expanding Hollister stores for generating incremental sales  Though gross margin in fiscal 2018 is projected to be slightly above the fiscal 2017 level of 59 7   it is likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter  Abercrombie carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Hibbett Sports  Inc    NASDAQ HIBB   is witnessing negative gross and operating margins for six straight quarters now  Gross margin declined 153 bps  337 bps  440 bps and 160 bps in the fourth  third  second  first quarters of fiscal 2018  respectively  It witnessed 180 bps decline in the fourth quarter and 70 bps in the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Meanwhile  the company recorded a respective operating margin decline of 180 bps  480 bps  330 bps  350 bps and 330 bps in the fourth  third and first quarter of fiscal 2018  and the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017  Further  it incurred an operating loss of  5 2 million in second quarter fiscal 2018 Higher promotions and markdowns undertaken to improve inventory  increased e commerce penetration  greater operating and marketing expenses have been taking a toll on Hibbett s margins  However  management is making efforts to boost margins and profitability by expanding its loyalty program  driving e commerce growth and ramping up inventory management initiatives  Though Hibbett expects gross margin to expand in fiscal 2019  higher SG A expenses  compensation costs and investments are expected to dent operating margin  Hibbett too holds a Zacks Rank  3 DICK S Sporting Goods  Inc    NYSE DKS   is another contender in the list of retailers grappling with margin constraints for last few quarters now  Gross margin declined 130 bps  307 bps  82 bps and 17 bps in the fourth  third  second and first quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  Further  operating margin contracted 205 bps  207 bps  10 bps and 53 bps in the same sequential order  Higher shipping and fulfillment expenses  SG A costs deleverage  and increased promotional activities have been denting the company s margins  Although management is taking cost reduction efforts to curtail its expenses and boost supply chain initiatives  margins might continue to remain under pressure in the near term  The company expects gross margin to reflect a marginal decline on improved product innovation cycle and a better balance of inventory in the supply chain  DICK S Sporting carries a Zacks Rank  3 Finally  Bed Bath   Beyond Inc    NASDAQ BBBY   has been severely hit by margin constraints in the retail sector for seven straight quarters now  The company s gross margin contracted 210 bps  180 bps  100 bps and 90 bps in the fourth  third  second and first quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  The company also witnessed a respective gross margin decline of 60 bps  80 bps and 70 bps in the fourth  third and second quarters of fiscal 2016  Operating margin contracted 310 bps  340 bps  360 bps and 240 bps in the fourth  third  second and first quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  Higher direct to customer shipping expenses  lower merchandise margin  rise in coupon expenses due to increased redemptions are weighing on its margins However  Bed Bath   Beyond remains on track with its transformation plan that focuses on improving operational efficiency and customer loyalty along with SKU optimization initiatives  In addition  its strategic portfolio management office  SPMO  to allocate resources toward more profitable areas for improving margins  optimizing inventory levels and enhancing supply chain looks encouraging  Though management expects gross margin to decline in fiscal 2018  operating margin is expected to contract but lesser than that in fiscal 2017  The company has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Wall Street s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this

127958,349473,ANF,Zumiez  ZUMZ  Falls On Q4 Earnings Miss  Sales Remain Strong,opinion,"Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ   delivered lower than expected earnings in fourth quarter fiscal 2017  despite solid top line trends  Notably  sales topped estimates for the seventh straight quarter  Additionally  the company s earnings and sales improved year over year However  shares of Zumiez declined 2  in the after market trading session yesterday  mainly due to the earnings lag and a soft earnings view for first quarter fiscal 2018  Nonetheless  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has advanced 11 4  in the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 1 3   This can primarily be attributed to its solid comps trend 
Q4 HighlightsZumiez delivered earnings of 82 cents per share  which improved 10 8  year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents Zumiez Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Net sales advanced 16 9  year over year to  308 2 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  302 million  The improvement in the top line came on the back of favorable comps  the contribution from the 53rd week  positive currency impact and 13 net new store additions since last year  Additionally  the company benefited from an adjustment to deferred revenues related to the STASH loyalty program Quarterly comps grew 7 5   substantially surpassing the company s projection of 7  growth  Comps benefited from higher transaction volume  somewhat offset by a drop in dollars per transaction  This marked its sixth straight quarter of positive comps and transaction gains  Moreover  strength in the men s  women s and footwear categories aided comps growth  partly negated by lower comps in accessories and hardgoods The company s robust comps performance in the quarter stemmed from the success in the holiday season  Further  top line growth reflects significant gains from its differentiated merchandising strategies  integrated sales channels and excellent customer service Further  the company s positive comps trend continued in February  Comps for the four week period ended Mar 3  2018  escalated 9 2  against a 3 1  decline recorded a year ago quarter  Moreover  Zumiez reported sales growth of 23 2  to  63 4 million in February In the reported quarter  gross profit jumped 22  to about  114 7 million  while gross margin expanded 150 basis points  bps  to 37 2   The increase can be attributed to 120 bps occupancy expense leverage  70 bps gains from product margin and 80 bps related to the aforementioned adjustment to deferred revenues associated with the STASH loyalty program  This was partly negated by 70 bps rise in inventory shrinkage and 20 bps increase in incentive compensation Zumiez s selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 17 5  to nearly  77 7 million  while as a percentage of sales  SG A expense expanded 20 bps to 25 2   The higher expenses related to increased annual incentive compensation were partly offset by leverage in store operating and corporate costs Operating income grew 32 4  year over year to  18 8 million  Moreover  operating margin expanded 130 bps to 12  Financial UpdateAs of Feb 3  Zumiez s cash and marketable securities were  121 9 million  up 54 7  year over year  The upside was driven by cash flow from operations  partly offset by capital expenditures  Total shareholders  equity at the end of the quarter was  355 9 million Further  the company generated  65 5 million as cash flow from operations in fiscal 2017  Capital expenditures for the year totaled  24 1 million For fiscal 2018  the company anticipates capital expenditures in a range of  21  23 million  which will be primarily used for new store openings and planned remodels Store UpdateIn fiscal 2017  the company opened 19 new stores  including 12 in North America  five in Europe and two in Australia  Additionally  the company closed six stores as a part of its strategy of optimizing store fleet  This brings the net store openings for fiscal 2017 to 13 As of Feb 3  2018  the company operated a total of 698 stores  including 657 in North America  34 in Europe and seven in Australia In fiscal 2018  the company plans to open about 13 new stores including six in the United States  five in Europe and two in Australia  It anticipates nearly half of these openings to occur ahead of the back to school season GuidanceGoing into 2018  Zumiez remains confident of delivering accelerated earnings growth for the year  backed by solid top line and positive comps trends  margin enhancement programs  improved expense leverage and lower taxes  Additionally  the company believes that infrastructure investments  made to provide a seamless customer experience and a unique approach to merchandising  will aid both top  and bottom line growth in 2018 and beyond Consequently  the company projects comps to grow in the low single digit range in fiscal 2018  However  it expects sales and earnings for the year to be impacted by the absence of the additional 53rd week compared with fiscal 2017 Further  the company expects product margins to be flat to slightly accretive in fiscal 2018  Operating profit is estimated to increase in the high single digit range  SG A expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than fiscal 2017  due to strong expense management and absence of increase in incentive compensation that occurred in fiscal 2017  Apart from the aforementioned gains  the company expects earnings for fiscal 2018 to benefit from the new tax reform with an effective tax rate of roughly 27  However  the company s guidance for first quarter fiscal 2018 was slightly disappointing  While the company robust comps growth and sales guidance  earnings projections were discouraging The company expects net sales for the first quarter in the  198  202 million range  while comps growth is anticipated to be 4 6   The company stated that monthly sales in the quarter will be impacted by the shift in Easter holiday  The shift is likely to bear a positive impact on sales for March and hurt sales in April Consolidated operating margins are projected between negative 2 6  and negative 1 7   At the high end of the guidance  this reflects nearly 46  decline from first quarter fiscal 2017  Consequently  the company projects loss per share of 13 18 cents compared with a loss of 18 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter  This is likely to stem from 3 cents per share negative impact  related to the company s inability to recognize the tax benefit on losses in certain jurisdictions within Europe Moreover  this is estimated to negatively impact earnings per share for the

127959,349474,ANF,Are Apparel Makers  Tariff Concerns Warranted  5 Great Picks,opinion,The apparel and footwear industry are the latest to voice their concerns over President Donald Trump s plans to impose tariffs on goods imported from China  as these will result in higher consumer prices  The U S  government is apparently preparing to impose tariffs on Chinese information technology  telecommunications and consumer goods in order to force changes in China s intellectual property and investment prices Tariffs mean higher prices of products and this invariably has sparked fear among retailers  apparel manufacturers and shoemakers  as many of these companies rely on imports  Apart from a number of U S  retail giants  the American Apparel and Footwear Association  AAFA  and as many as 82 footwear companies wrote a letter to the White House objecting to the tariff However  the apparel and footwear industry  particularly men s and boys  apparel wholesaling  has been witnessing steady growth over the past five years and is expected to continue performing well in the days to come  Moreover  a recovering economy  increasing consumer confidence  wage growth and higher purchasing power have stimulated consumer expenditure on discretionary industry products  resulting in higher revenues for the companies   Given this scenario  it makes for a good time to invest in apparel and footwear stock Apparel Manufacturers  Shoemakers Oppose TariffsThe heavily China reliant U S  shoemakers and apparel manufactures have joined retailers in lobbying against Trump s proposed tariffs on goods imported from that country for fear of an inordinate flare up in prices of these consumer discretionary goods In fact  Washington could impose more than  60 billion in tariffs on goods ranging from apparels to footwear  electronics and toys  Analysts are of the opinion that any additional broad based tariff means burdening the American working families as they will have to pay higher prices for household basics like clothing  shoes and electronics Not only apparel and shoemakers but also the entire U S  fashion industry is worried about the proposed tariffs  In fact  the recent imposition of 25  and 10  tariffs on imported steel and aluminum too is going to hit the apparel and footwear industry Steve Lamar  executive vice president of the AAFA remarked that imposing tariffs on imported items ultimately passes on the tax on to consumers   There is a direct cost that rolls into our industry  It is not like the can industry or the auto industry  but it is there   he said  adding that manufacturers  retailers and importers purchase trucks to haul merchandise and manufacturers package their goods in aluminum cans Moreover  most shoemakers feel that footwear is already subject to hefty tariffs and more tariffs on top of this burden would only result in higher prices and fewer U S  jobs That said  the footwear and apparel industry has been performing well for a while now and tariff fears might be a bit overblown  more so because a strong lobby is showing aggressive opposition  Moreover  a recovering economy and higher wages are always an indication of increasing disposable income  So it might bit a too early to press the panic buttons Steady Growth of Apparel and Footwear IndustryThe U S  apparel and footwear industry has witnessed steady growth over the past few years  Especially  the men s and boy s apparel wholesaling industry has seen remarkable growth in the last five years and the trend is expect to continue in the future The primary driver of this steady growth has been a recovering economy  which has seen an increase in consumer confidence and rising disposable income  resulting in higher consumer spending on consumer discretionary products from the apparel and footwear shelves  Moreover  an appreciating dollar and a continuing decline in cotton input prices for upstream manufacturers have combined to lower industry purchase costs  resulting in higher gains for the industry Moreover  increasing wages and strong gains in per capita disposable income are expected to encourage more consumer expenditure on consumer discretionary products  Our ChoicesDespite tariff induced concerns and the ensuing agitation  it is a bit too early to be apprehensive  especially since apparel manufacturers and shoemakers have been performing well for the last few years  Plus  a recovering economy  robust confidence  increasing wages and higher disposable income hint at the industry s steady growth over the next five years Adding apparel and footwear stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for

Favorable foreign currency rate is expected to contribute nearly  50 million to sales and  15 million to operating income in fiscal 2018  Furthermore  it expects core tax rate to be in the mid to high 20s range  driven by the recently enacted tax reform Abercrombie   Fitch Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 climbed substantially to 68 cents and 71 cents per share  respectively  from previous estimates of 47 cents and 60 cents Going forward  the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs  stores  direct to consumer and omni channel capabilities  Further  it expects to maintain the disciplined approach to expense management for driving top  and bottom line growth  So  here is a sneak peek into the company s initiatives which are fueling growth Other CatalystsAbercrombie is making significant progress in expanding digital presence with the growth of direct to consumer and omni channel capabilities  Its investments in mobile  omni channel and fulfillment have significantly aided the growth of the direct to consumer business  which delivered double digit increase in both the United States and international markets in fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Notably  digital engagement with consumers has been the company s core strength  This is clear from the fact that more than 70  of the DTC traffic came from mobiles in the fourth quarter  Additionally  its investments in DTC are paying off with conversions improving 14  in the fourth quarter 
Overall  the DTC business accounted for nearly 34  of net sales in the fourth quarter  recording 18  increase in comparable sales  In fiscal 2018  the company plans to continue investing in DTC capabilities alongside bringing innovations in this channel  using customer insights and data analytics Additionally  Abercrombie is aggressively expanding Hollister stores in new markets  The idea is that the smaller size of operation makes it cheaper and less capital intensive compared with the namesake brand  Growth of the Hollister brand internationally could enhance its overall performance  The Hollister brand reflects persistent positive momentum from previous quarters  reaching the  2 billion mark in sales in fourth quarter fiscal 2017 Further  comparable store sales  comps  for the Hollister brand improved 11  in the fourth quarter as it continued to capitalize on the momentum  delivering positive comps in both the United States and international markets  Hollister is gaining from the positive customer response to product innovations  emerging categories and overall customer experience Not only this  the company remains focused on streamlining its store fleet by closing underperforming stores and expanding in markets with growth potential  Store closure gives Abercrombie more flexibility in terms of cost savings  amid a tough environment  Since 2010  it closed more than 400 stores while nearly 60  of its U S  leases are set to expire in the next two years  This provides significant flexibility to strike the right channel balance and drive efficiency with options to remodel or resize stores  renegotiate leases or close stores Looking for More Solid Picks  Check TheseInvestors can count upon some better ranked stocks in the same industry like The Finish Line Inc    NASDAQ FINL    The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   and Nordstrom  Inc    NYSE JWN    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Finish Line  with long term earnings growth rate of 10 4   has reported average positive earnings surprise of 2 6  in the trailing four quarters Gap  with long term earnings growth rate of 8   has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11 1  in the trailing four quarters Nordstrom  with long term earnings growth rate of 6   has come up with an average positive earnings surprise of 16 8  in the trailing four quarters Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6  and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-03-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abercrombie-up-337-in-3-months-whats-driving-stock-200301237,200301237
127969,349484,ANF,L Brands Down 37  In 3 Months  More Pain Or Relief Ahead ,opinion,"Despite undertaking several strategic measures to drive performance  L Brands  Inc    NYSE LB   has failed to impress investors  The stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 36 7  in the past three months  wider than the  s fall of 7 1   The company s recent performance indicates that it may take some more time to adjust to changing retail landscape 
However  other stocks such as Tapestry  Inc    NYSE TPR    Zumiez Inc    NASDAQ ZUMZ   and Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF    belonging to the same industry  have witnessed a rally of 20 1   13 3  and 35 4  in the past three months  respectively  Today  we will focus on L Brands and try to analyze the factors that are keeping investors away from the stock 
More Pain Ahead
In spite of beating estimates for earnings and sales in the fourth quarter of 2017  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s stock was affected by dismal first quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook  Per management  it anticipates first quarter comps in low single digits  Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of 15 20 cents  down from 33 cents in the year ago quarter 
For fiscal 2018  the company expects comps to increase in the 2 4   range while sales are estimated to be 2 points higher than comps  Management projects earnings in the band of  2 95  3 25 per share  compared with  3 20 last year 
Analysts were expecting the company to be back on track after disappointing performances in the past few quarters  However  a dismal outlook forced them to slash their estimates  In the past 30 days  the company s fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings estimate have moved down 31 cents and 32 cents to  3 17 and  3 42  respectively  In the same time frame  first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings estimate have declined to 19 cents from 32 cents  respectively 

 
Further  gross margin  which contracted in all of the four quarters in fiscal 2016  disappointed investors in 2017  In the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017  adjusted gross margin contracted 320  120  190 and 100 basis points  bps  to 37 1   37 3   37 8  and 42 3   respectively 
The downside was primarily caused by buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage in the quarter  The metric was affected by fall in merchandise margin rate  Management expects first quarter fiscal 2018 gross margin rate to decline year over year  due to fall in merchandise margin rate  somewhat offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses 
Performance of Victoria s Secret has been a cause of concern for quite some time  In an effort to streamline Victoria s Secret business  the company made some strategic changes in 2016  However  these efforts are yet to show fruitful results  In fourth quarter fiscal 2017  sales at Victoria s Secret Stores declined 1 2  to  2 038 3 million  while Victoria s Secret direct sales were up 19 9  to  630 6 million  Total Victoria s Secret sales rose 3 1  to  2 668 9 million  while comparable sales fell 1  
You can see   
Bottom Line
Undoubtedly  the aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors  Nevertheless  L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience  localizing assortments and enhancing direct business  The company is focusing on cost containment  inventory management  merchandise and speed to market initiatives

marginally Brand wise  comps rose 34  at Aerie stores  while it improved 5  at AE brand outlets  Notably  this marked aerie brand s 15th straight quarter of positive comps Quarter in DetailGross profit increased 9 4  to  425 1 million in the reported quarter  with the gross margin contraction of 80 basis points  bps  to 34 6   The decline can primarily be attributed to greater promotions and increased shipping costs and compensation  partly negated by lower rent  However  the company witnessed sequential improvements from the 270 bps  240 bps and 120 bps gross margin declines in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  Clearly  this reflected a solid reduction in gross margin erosion from 270 bps in the first quarter to 80 bps in the fourth quarter SG A expenses increased nearly 9  to  263 8 million  while as a percentage of sales it leveraged 60 bps to 21 5   The rise in SG A expenses  in dollar terms  was driven by higher store salaries  due to a

digital projects as well as general corporate maintenance As of Feb 3  American Eagle s merchandise inventory at cost was roughly  398 million  up 11  from the comparable year ago period  The increase is attributed to the investments in bottoms  women s tops and Aerie apparel to support strong sales trends During 2017  the company returned nearly  176 million to shareholders by paying dividends of  89 million and buying back 6 million shares for  88 million Backed by its strong cash position  positive free cash flow and gains from the tax reform  the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10

128015,349530,ANF,5 Stocks Made Lucrative By Recent Broker Rating Upgrades ,opinion, Strike while the iron is hot  is appropriate in all walks of life and the investing world is no exception  Investors  after all  are putting their hard earned money into a stock and expectations of handsome returns are quite obvious However  the uncertainties associated with the investment world and the deluge of stocks flooding the market make the task a daunting one  In the wake of this  picking the right stocks is quite similar to looking for a needle in a haystack Moreover  with time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to keep track of market movements to identify opportune moment s  for buying or offloading a particular stock to maximize returns  Therefore  guidance from proper channels is a must Broker Advice to the RescueThe  experts  in the field of investing are brokers who are equipped with detailed knowledge about the space  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors   To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations   Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks What About Revenues While we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  This especially holds true in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio that serves as a strong complementary valuation metric Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks   change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter in the past four weeks To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most

article include  Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF    Express  Inc    NYSE EXPR    Boise Cascade Company   NYSE BCC    Beazer Homes USA   NYSE BZH   and Bristow Group   NYSE BRS   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks Made Lucrative by Recent Broker Rating Upgrades Strike while the iron is hot  is appropriate in all walks of life and the investing world is no exception  Investors  after all  are putting their hard earned money into a stock and expectations of handsome returns are quite obvious However  the uncertainties associated with the investment world and the deluge of stocks flooding the market make the task a daunting one  In the wake of this  picking the right stocks is quite similar to looking for a needle in a haystack Moreover  with time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to keep track of market movements to identify opportune moment s  for buying or offloading a particular stock to maximize returns  Therefore  guidance from proper channels is a must Broker Advice to the RescueThe  experts  in the field of investing are brokers who are equipped with detailed knowledge about the space  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent   have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors   To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations   Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks What About Revenues While we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance This especially holds true in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio that serves as a strong complementary valuation metric And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining

128020,349535,ANF,Can Abercrombie s  ANF  Strategic Actions Offset Hurdles ,opinion,"Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   has been gaining from its strategic initiatives and strength in Hollister as well as direct to consumer businesses  While the company is making aggressive strides to improve performance at its namesake brand  highly competitive environment and pressurized margins remain threats to the company s turnaround 
However  Abercrombie   Fitch surged 34 5  in the last three months against  s gain of 21 1   Let s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company 

Solid Strategic Actions Enhancing Performance  Outlook Raised
Abercrombie s strategic capital investments  cost saving efforts  loyalty and marketing programs have aided the company s performance as evident from its robust surprise trend  The company delivered earnings and sales beat in third quarter fiscal 2017  marking the second straight positive earnings surprise and the third consecutive sales beat  Further  it remains encouraged by comparable store sales  comps  performance as it marked the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement 
Given the strong performance  the company provided an encouraging view for fourth quarter fiscal 2017  Comps are projected to be up low single digits in the fiscal fourth quarter while sales are anticipated to be in the band of up mid  to high single digits  Going forward  foreign currency is expected to be tailwind for the company  slightly boosting sales and operating income 
Hollister Stores Have Potential for Growth
While Abercrombie s namesake brand has been struggling  Hollister has been a savior for the company  Hollister stores have been delivering sustained comps performance since fourth quarter fiscal 2016  Notably  comps for the brand rose 8  in the most recent quarter as it continued to capitalize on momentum  delivering positive comps in both the United States and international markets  Hollister is gaining from the positive customer response toward product innovations  emerging categories and overall customer experience 
In fact  the company has been focused on expanding Hollister stores in the new markets  The idea behind this is that its smaller size of operation makes it cheaper and less capital intensive compared with the company s namesake brand  We believe Hollister brand s growth internationally might enhance the company s overall performance 
Strategic Initiatives
Abercrombie remains focused on reviving its brands  enhancing performance and returning to profitable growth  Notably  the company s initiatives to spur growth include improving leadership team and organizational structure  optimizing store fleet by introducing stores in high performing markets while closing underperforming ones  remodeling stores and assortments in order to meet changing trends and demands  developing omni channel capacities and focusing on key merchandise and design processes  Additionally  Abercrombie keeps its discounts low along with a check on promotional activities in an attempt to enhance margins 
As part of its efforts to streamline operations  the company has been closing down underperforming U S  chain stores  This will aid in boosting Abercrombie s top and bottom lines  It also plans to shutter nearly 60 stores in the United States by the end of the fiscal year through natural lease expirations  This includes 14 stores which have been closed year to date  These store closures are anticipated to give Abercrombie more flexibility in terms of cost savings  amid a tough environment  where retailers are facing intense competition from continued shift to online shopping 
Strained Margins
As mentioned above  Abercrombie s namesake brand continues to impede results  Notably  sales for the Abercrombie brand declined 2  to 351 million in the fiscal third quarter  with comps falling 2   While the company is making strides to improve performance at Abercrombie based on learning from Hollister  we believe full turnaround for the brand is still away 
Furthermore  the company has been witnessing strained margins for few quarters now due to soft traffic at stores as well as a highly promotional environment  Additionally  the company s ongoing strategic initiatives to improve profitability have been weighing on the margins  Going forward  the company anticipates gross margin to decline roughly 100 bps in the fiscal fourth quarter from the prior year rate of 59 3   Gross margin is likely to be pressured by higher average unit retail due to a competitive market environment

128116,349631,ANF,Will American Eagle s Growth Plans Combat Soft Margins ,opinion,Popular apparel and accessories retailer  American Eagle Outfitters Inc    NYSE AEO   is benefiting from solid strategies like enhancing product assortments  managing inventories efficiently and boosting e commerce business  These efforts helped the company make a comeback in second quarter fiscal 2017  alongside retaining its sturdy comparable store sales  comps  trends However  in the process of keeping pace with the changing consumer environment and battling stiff industry competition  the company is witnessing strained margins  So  let s see if American Eagle s growth drivers will be enough to offset these hurdles  and help the company keep its growth story intact American Eagle s Growth Endeavors On TrackGiven Amazon com Inc  s   NASDAQ AMZN   growing control and consumers  rapid shift to online shopping  retailers are firing on all cylinders to tap sales  Many apparel companies like Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   and The Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS   have resorted to the omni channel strategy  Likewise  American Eagle too remains focused on strengthening its product assortments by adding more compelling brands  managing inventory levels diligently and improving e commerce business Moreover  it remains committed toward enhancing store sales by rationalizing its brick and mortar store fleet that includes closing underperforming stores and expanding the profitable ones  In sync  the company recently announced plans to close about 25 40 stores in fiscal 2017  Additionally  it targets opening 10 outlets  including five AE and Aerie stores  each  across the United States  Canada and Mexico through the rest fiscal 2017  as well as 32 international licensed stores Further  it remains on track to launch the revamped loyalty program that is likely to convert more than 15 million current metrics and attract new customers with a seamless overall experience  This completely digital program will be fully integrated across shopping channels  enhancing customers  shopping experience  Also  American Eagle has been improving its website as well as mobile app to develop its omni channel platform  Notably  these endeavors helped American Eagle s e commerce sales to contribute about 23  to total revenues in second quarter fiscal 2017 Factors That Drove Q2 PerformanceWhile the quarter marked second straight quarter of sales beat  earnings topped estimates after a miss in the last quarter  The company also posted 10th straight quarter of positive comparable store sales  comps  backed by strong online sales at both the brands driven by efficient use of omni channel capabilities to enhance customer experience  Results also gained from strength in the aerie brand  which posted 14th straight quarter of double digit comps growth  Moreover  the company is optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017  particularly the fall season Strained Margins  A Major ConcernWhile retailers remain committed toward strategies like optimizing store fleet and boosting e commerce sales  consumers  evolving preferences and mounting industry competition have forced them to undertake intense promotions to clear inventory  American Eagle is not safe from this trend  Though American Eagle s second quarter fiscal 2017 marked a comeback  margins continued to be under pressure due to increased promotional activities to counter sluggish mall traffic The company s adjusted gross margin contracted 240 basis points  bps  in the second quarter  while operating margin shriveled 230 bps  The downturn was mainly accountable to greater promotional activity  alongside a rise in buying  occupancy and warehousing costs  and higher SG A expenses  Going forward  the company expects the soft margin trends to continue and hurt results in the fiscal third quarter  as evident from its recent guidance  For the fiscal third quarter  the company projects soft merchandise margins due to intense promotional activities  Moreover  it anticipates SG A expenses to increase in low single digits So  What s in Store for American Eagle Nevetheless  American Eagle is focused on undertaking initiatives to reduce costs through supply chain efficiencies and its updated product allocation system  We believe that all aforementioned initiatives should help the company combat the hurdles and drive profitability Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and

128119,349634,ANF,Forget L Brands  Buy These 4 Retail Apparel Stocks Instead,opinion,"The retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change in shopping trends  With customer focus gradually shifting to online shopping  store and mall traffic has been hit hard  Retailers are now concentrating more on enhancing their omni channel capabilities  optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities 
Moreover  steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration are undoubted signs of economic recovery  These are playing a crucial role in raising buyers  confidence  We expect this positive sentiment to translate in to higher consumer spending that may help rev up sales 
Among the host of industries that builds up the overall  sector  we are focusing on  industry  which occupies top 34   91 out of 265  position  Despite being placed in top 34  position  there are certain underperforming stocks in the industry that are limiting the overall growth potential of the industry 
Among these  L Brands  Inc    NYSE LB   is one such stock which is struggling to find space in the investors  good books due to dwindling top and bottom line results along with disappointing comparable store sales  comps  performance  Year to date  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 36  
What s Giving L Brands a Tough Time 
L Brands continues to face short term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category  which according to analysts have failed to generate desired results  A look at the company s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7  and 5  in the first and second quarter  respectively 
Maintaining the same chronological order  we note that earnings per share fell 44  and 31   respectively  Moreover  the second quarter marked the fourth straight quarter when the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Further  comps have also been witnessing a sharp decline in the past ten months  This specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel  beauty and personal care products reported 2  drop in comps for the five week ended Sep 30  2017 following declines of 4   7   9   7   5   10  13   4  and 1  in August  July  June  May  April  March  February  January and December  respectively 
Investor sentiment was further hurt after the company trimmed fiscal 2017 guidance  when it reported second quarter fiscal 2017 results  Management projects earnings in the band of  3 00  3 20 per share for fiscal 2017  down from the previous guidance of  3 10  3 40  This was also below the fiscal 2016 earnings of  3 74 and fiscal 2015 earnings of  3 99  Moreover  the company anticipates the fiscal third quarter earnings in the range of 25 30 cents  compared with prior year quarter earnings of 42 cents 
Well it is quite apparent from above introspection that L Brands is having a tough time  But it nowhere suggests that the industry is devoid of gems 4 Prominent Picks

has regained strength after Irma lost its intensity and caused lower than anticipated destruction in Florida  The fact that tensions between the United States and North Korea haven t worsened also helped investors to breathe easy  In fact  major indices moved north following the positive developments Investors would now like to make the most of the bullish scenario and add stocks with potential to gain handsomely to their respective portfolios  Moreover  with the Q3 reporting cycle not too far away  potential outperformers are highly sought after  No one after all wants to see his her hard earned money go down the drains  In fact  maintaining a well diversified portfolio  selecting stocks from different industries  is a tried and tested strategy to combat market uncertainties and generate handsome returns However  with a deluge of stocks flooding the market at any point of time  the task of designing one s portfolio with promising stocks is by no means easy for individual investors  The time constraint that we all face these days makes the task harder in the absence of guidance from experts in the field  These experts are brokers  They are equipped with detailed knowledge about the investing space Since brokers arrive at their recommendation  Buy  Sell or Hold  on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the minute details associated with the company  it is natural for investors to be guided by estimate revisions while arriving at investment decisions  Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario  Similarly  a stock may fall out of brokers  favor due to adverse events like pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often results in stock price depreciation  Naturally  investors tend to dump such stocks on the basis of broker advice Making the Most of Broker OpinionsWe have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information

 companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio  Price greater than 5  as a stock trading below  5 will not likely create

128216,349731,ANF,Stocks Manage A Mildly Mixed Monday Finish,opinion,"U S  stocks began the week mixed as tech listings outperformed on light data following Friday s upbeat employment report  while the markets await a heavy week of events  notably the unofficial start of Q2 earnings season and Fed Chair Yellen s Congressional testimony  Treasuries advanced as the lone report from the domestic docket showed consumer credit expanded more than expected  Gold and crude oil prices were higher and the U S  dollar was nearly flat  In light equity news  ClubCorp agreed to be acquired by Apollo Management and Abercrombie   Fitch announced that it terminated takeover talks
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  dipped 6 points to 21 409  the S P 500 Index increased 2 points  0 1   to 2 427  and the NASDAQ Composite increased 23 points  0 4   to 6 176  In moderate volume  798 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 7 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil gained  0 17 to  44 40 per barrel and wholesale gasoline was flat at  1 50 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price gained  1 57 to  1 214 03 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was mostly flat at 96 06

Economic and earnings data set to heat up this week
Consumer credit  released in the final hour of trading  showed consumer borrowing advanced by  18 4 billion during May  well above the  13 5 billion forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg  while April s figure was adjusted higher to an increase of  12 9 billion from the originally reported  8 2 billion  Non revolving debt  which includes student loans and loans for vehicles and mobile homes  climbed by  11 0 billion  while revolving debt  which includes credit cards  increased by  7 4 billion 
Treasuries ticked higher as the yield on the 2 Year note dipped 2 basis points  bps  to 1 38  and the yield on the 10 Year note declined 1 bp to 2 37   while the 30 Year bond rate was flat at 2 93  
Although the economic front began slowly  this week s calendar will heat up and is poised to garner heavy attention as the markets grapple with what path the Fed s monetary policy normalization will take  Bond yields have rebounded from depressed levels hit in mid June and the U S  dollar has stabilized from lows hit to close out the first half of 2017  In the second half of 2017  we expect 10 year Treasury yields to remain in a 2  to 2 5  range  consistent with the eight year  lower for longer  theme in the bond market  We believe the Federal Reserve to continue to tighten monetary policy and reduce its balance sheet gradually  assuming inflation doesn t slip further 
Inflation will come into focus  with the releases of the Producer Price Index  PPI  and Consumer Price Index  CPI   while key hard data will come in the form of retail sales  as well as industrial production and capacity utilization  Sentiment and business activity indicators will also be released  courtesy of the Fed s Beige Book  along with tomorrow s NFIB Small Business Optimism Index and Friday s preliminary July University of Michigan s Consumer Sentiment Index  However  this week s two day Congressional monetary policy testimony by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen will likely headline the docket  Also  earnings season is set to kick off with some major companies out of the financial sector delivering results 
Additional reports expected on tomorrow s domestic docket include the Labor Department s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  JOLTS   with economists forecasting that the measure of unmet demand for labor showed 5 95 million jobs were available to be filled during May  down slightly from the 6 04 million posted the month prior and wholesale inventories  forecasted to have increased 0 3  m m in May  matching the rise seen in April 
Stocks have been drifting along near record highs and background conditions remain relatively positive in the near term  But seasonal tendencies remain a risk and volatility has picked up a bit  so investors should be on alert for a summer pullback  The U S  economy continues to glide along  with subdued inflation  providing what typically has been a good environment for stocks  though uncertainty regarding future Fed actions has risen  Bond yields have ticked higher and some commodities have recovered  but it s too early to say that the reflation story is regaining credence 
Europe and Asia higher as busy week begins 
European equities finished higher  with Friday s upbeat U S  labor report helping improve global sentiment as a busy week begins  overshadowing festering geopolitical concerns toward North Korea and following last week s G 20 Summit in Germany  The euro and British pound dipped versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region gave back some recent gains 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher following Friday s gains in the U S  that followed a stronger than expected June nonfarm payroll report  while the markets digested some mixed data in the region  Japanese equities advanced with the yen losing ground on the U S  jobs data and a report that showed Japanese machine orders  a gauge of capital spending  unexpectedly fell 
Mainland Chinese stocks declined and shares that traded in Hong Kong were higher after reports showed the nation s CPI and PPI both rose roughly in line with expectations  Australian securities increased and South Korean listings ticked higher  Indian equities rallied to another record high  The markets shrugged off heightened geopolitical concerns following last week s first intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM  test by North Korea and in the wake of the G 20 Summit in Germany 
The international economic docket for tomorrow will be relatively light with releases including machine tool orders from Japan  home loans and business confidence from Australia and industrial production from Italy ",2017-07-11,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-manage-a-mildly-mixed-monday-finish-200200195,200200195

128259,349774,ANF,Abercrombie  ANF  Moving Out Of The Woods  Time To Hold ,opinion,Apparel retailer Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   seems to be slowly emerging out of the woods as the stock is recovering and so are its top line and bottom line results  The stock which delivered a negative return of 32 3  in the past one year  has taken a U turn and has returned 5 2  year to date  Further  this performance outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 19 3  The credit for this improvement goes to the company s strategic capital investments  cost saving efforts  loyalty and marketing programs  which are gaining traction  Abercrombie remains focused on reviving brands  enhancing performance and returning to profitable growth  Consequently  the company has been implementing several steps to spur on its business forward  These initiatives include improving leadership team and organizational structure  optimizing store fleet by introducing stores in high performing markets  while closing the underperforming ones along with remodeling stores and improving assortments to meet changing trends and demands  Further  it is developing omni channel capacities and focusing on key merchandise and design processes Also  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company keeps discounts low along with a check on promotional activities  in an attempt to enhance margins  We believe that the company is very much on track to bring a turnaround as management expects these efforts to revive its iconic brands  and drive notable and sustained growth These initiatives have brought forward meaningful results  as evident from the revival of the Hollister brand and solid direct to consumer  DTC  performance  While Hollister delivered 3  rise in comparable store sales  comps  in first quarter fiscal 2017  the DTC business accounted for nearly 27  of sales in the quarter  The solid performance of these businesses in turn aided the company to post in line earnings and sales beat in the fiscal first quarter Abercrombie   Fitch Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    What are the Possible Deterrents However  both the top line and bottom line declined year over year  The fall in the top line primarily stemmed from a tough retail environment characterized by heightened promotional activity and soft comps  Further  adverse currency headwinds dented results  In the most recent quarter  adverse currency exchange rates hurt Abercrombie s sales by nearly  12 million  170 bps   operating income by  5 million and earnings by 5 cents per share Further  Abercrombie has a record of dismal earnings and sales trends  having reported negative earnings and sales surprises in four of the last five quarters  Evidently  the company delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 26 2  in the trailing four quarters Coming to the guidance  the company made no major changes in its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017  While it expects comps to remain challenging during the fiscal second quarter  improvements are anticipated in the second half of the year  Moreover  foreign currency headwinds are likely to persist and hurt sales as well as operating income in fiscal 2017  Gross margin is expected to remain pressurized during the second quarter and fall slightly from last year s rate of 61  in fiscal 2017  These factors led to the widening of loss estimates in the last 30 days The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 widened from a loss to 11 cents to a loss of 23 cents per share  while the estimate for fiscal 2018 moved from a loss of 2 cents to a loss of 9 cents per share  Further  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 34 cents per share for the fiscal second quarter reflects 34 9  decline from the prior year quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of  758 3 million  down 3 2  from the year ago quarter Bottom LineAbercrombie s stock performance and recent financial results definitely point to a marked improvement in the company s historic trends  Further  the improvement in Hollister and DTC are encouraging  However  we cannot ignore the fact that the company is yet return to delivering profits and the outlook is slightly strained  Hence  we would suggest waiting for more pronounced improvement before making a buy or sell decision on the stock  So  holding on to the stock is a good idea at the moment Stocks to ConsiderBetter ranked stocks in the retail sector include The Children s Place Inc    NASDAQ PLCE    Build A Bear Workshop Inc    NYSE BBW   and Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc    NASDAQ BGFV    All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Children s Place has an average positive earnings surprise of 36 6  in the trailing four quarters  The stock has a long term growth rate of 8  Build A Bear Workshop has a long term EPS growth rate of 22 5   Further  the company has to its credit a spectacular earnings surprise history with an average beat of 67 5  recorded in the trailing four quarters Big 5 Sporting has an average positive earnings surprise of 94 5  in the trailing four quarters  The stock has a long term growth rate of 12  Zacks

128262,349777,ANF,Can Store Closures Save American Eagle   Its Mall Companions,opinion,Like most mall based retailers  American Eagle Outfitters Inc    NYSE AEO   has also been going through a rough phase of late largely due to soft store and mall traffic trends  as well as stiff competition that has been plaguing the retail space  Further  a rapid shift in consumer preference toward online shopping and the growth of eCommerce giant Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   has spelt doom of many brick and mortar store retailers The cumulative impact of the aforementioned factors is quite visible in American Eagle s stock performance  which has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months  Shares of this Pittsburgh  PA based apparel retailer have declined 5 9   while the Zacks categorized  industry registered a 1 5  fall  Moreover  the stock has considerably lagged the Zacks categorized  sector s growth of 6 7  Additionally  these factors have weighed upon American Eagle s earnings performance in first quarter fiscal 2017  Further  the company s dismal second quarter view and recently announced store closure plans have been deterrents for the stock  Aptly  the stock currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    You can see  That said  let s get a better understanding of the various factors that have pushed the stock out of investors  favor Aggressive Store Closure PlansWhile we can ponder upon various aspects to reason out the fate of this leading specialty retailer  one factor that stands out is the company s aggressive take on store closures  The company has been closing down stores to combat the decline in sales and higher store operating costs as traffic continues to remain soft  Notably  in first quarter fiscal 2017  the company closed three stores while it opened six stores  Further  the company plans to shut down 25 40 stores in fiscal 2017 Also  the company plans to accelerate store closures going forward  Moreover  it is experimenting with the closure of stores where the sales has clearly migrated from brick and mortar to online  Notably  American Eagle has about 500 stores  leases expiring in the next five years  providing opportunities for closing down the less profitable locations  This aggressive approach to store closures has considerably hurt investor sentiments However  American Eagle is not the only retailer which has resorted to this approach  Of late  many other American mall based retailers have come up with plans to optimize store fleets in order to stay competitive and remain profitable in this eCommerce dominated space  Evidently  mall based retailer J  C  Penney Co  Inc    NYSE JCP   revealed plans to close about 138 stores in March  while Sears Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SHLD   is looking to shutter 42 Sears locations  Further  department store chain Macy s Inc    NYSE M   has also been aggressively closing stores in order to stabilize its brick and mortar business Additionally  American Eagle s close rival Bebe Stores Inc    NASDAQ BEBE   has opted to shut down all of its brick and  mortar stores and serve customers by re launching its eCommerce platform as well as international brick and mortar stores  Also  Abercrombie   Fitch Co    NYSE ANF   plans to shut down 60 stores in the U S on the basis of lease expirations MarginsComing back to American Eagle  the company s margins continue to remain pressurized owing to intense promotions undertaken by the company to counter sluggish demand  Further  it expects weak merchandise margins in second quarter fiscal 2017  owing to intense promotional activities  SG A expenses are forecasted to increase in low single digits Dismal Outlook   Downtrend in EstimatesMoreover  the company s dismal second quarter guidance remains a deterrent  Driven by expectations of increased discounts and higher shipping expenses on online sales  the company anticipates comps to range from flat to down low single digits in the second quarter  Also  the company envisions earnings in the band of 15 17 cents  which is pegged considerably lower than the year ago earnings of 23 cents Consequently  the company s estimates have been witnessing a downtrend in the last seven days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 has declined to  1 11 per share and  1 16 per share  from  1 13 and  1 17  respectively Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been

128263,349778,ANF,Here s Why Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF  Stock Plummeted Today,opinion,"Shares of Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   fell 21  in mid morning trading on Monday after the company announced it will end talks to sell itself 
Last month  Abercrombie accepted final bids from interested parties  However  the company couldn t come to terms with its suitors and has decided to not sell itself  In reaction to this  shares of ANF are trading at a 17 year low 
 After a comprehensive review of all relevant factors  with the assistance of our financial advisor  the A F board of directors determined that the best path to enhance value for stockholders is the rigorous execution of our business plan   said Arthur Martinez  the company s CEO  in a statement 
 We believe in the prospects for our business and the opportunities for our brands   Martinez said 
Abercrombie   Fitch  on May 10 earlier this year that it was considering selling itself  Famous for its jeans and logo stamped shirts  the company has been struggling in recent years because of competition from fashion giants Forever 21  H M  and Zara 
Efforts to rebrand itself have not proven successful for Abercrombie   Fitch  either  The retailer has tried to modernize its brand by redesigning its stores  removing its logo heavy styles  and dropping its heavy sexualized advertising   However  these efforts don t seem to be working as the company plans on closing 60 stores by the end of the year 
ANF remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   While the company faces many challenges moving forward  the company has a value style score of  B

128291,349806,ANF,American Eagle  AEO  Shares Tank 13  On Bleak Guidance  Store Closings ,opinion,"Shares of American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO   plummeted on Wednesday after the clothing retailer reported its first quarter earnings  But the previous quarter proved not to be the issue  Instead  it s American Eagle s forecast that has investors jumping ship 
American Eagle  like many other American mall staples  faces an uphill battle in the fight to remain relevant and profitable as e commerce websites continue to proliferate   We are looking to get more aggressive with store closings   American Eagle CFO  on a conference call with analysts Wednesday   We ve been experimenting with closures of stores where we re really able to track sales migration  
Wednesday s earnings report noted that the teen based retailer s management plans to close between 25 and 40 stores in 2017   As we look ahead  we are taking the right steps to improve our results and adjust our business for today s rapidly evolving retail environment   CEO Jay Schottenstein said on the same call 
The company s stock price dropped 12 96  in early afternoon trading to a three year low  Shares of American Eagle are changing hands at a substantial rate  Wednesday s trading volume of 17 million is way above its average of 4 7 million  It is normal for a company s stock to be traded heavily in the days before and after it reports earnings  But with the stock tanking based on a grim outlook  things don t look great for the struggling brand 
American Eagle beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  744 million by posting revenues of  762 million  The company just narrowly missed our earnings estimates  But that slightly positive news seems to be on the backburner with American Eagle s dismal second quarter forecast 
Competition has  to offer deep discounts and eat excess online shipping costs  Therefore  American Eagle projects its second quarter sales to be flat or even decline by  low single  digits 
The Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania based retailer even  closed a location in January just a few blocks away from its corporate headquarters 
Malls
American Eagle operates heavily in shopping malls where the industry s once slow decline has transitioned into rapid decay  According to a  334 malls across the country are at risk of closing out of the roughly 1 300 enclosed shopping malls in the U S 
Once powerful mall retailer J C  Penney   NYSE JCP   in March announced it would soon close 138 stores  Sears Holdings   NASDAQ SHLD   plans to close 42 Sears  locations  and Macy s   NYSE M   provided a list of 68 stores it is set to close by mid year  On top of those  American Eagle competitors The Limited and Bebe   NASDAQ BEBE   both have closed down all of their brick and mortar stores  while Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   is also closing a large number of locations 
Some of the   REIT  stocks are also down on Wednesday  Shares of The Macerich Company   NYSE M    Real Estate Investment Trust   NYSE PEI    and Ramco Gershenson Properties Trust   NYSE RPT   fell marginally  while Chattanooga  Tennessee based CBL   Associates Properties  Inc    NYSE CBL   dropped by 3 36

128293,349808,ANF,These 5 Retailers Just Crushed Q1 Earnings  What The Heck Is Happening ,opinion,"Between yesterday after the bell and this morning before market open  there were a slew of retailers that reported their first quarter results  And surprisingly  the results were strong  with some posting better earnings and comparable store sales numbers than expected

Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF  
Abercrombie   Fitch reported a loss of 72 cents per share  this number excludes 19 cents from non recurring items  that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues declined 4  year over year to  661 1 million  but beat our consensus estimate of  653 million  total comparable store sales were down 3   Abercrombie s flagship net sales decreased 11  to  286 4 million  but sales at the Hollister brand increased 3  to  374 7 million 
The company is currently on the market to sell itself  Yesterday  the Wall Street Journal  that American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO    together with private equity firm Cerberus Capital  are teaming up to buy the struggling company  This has yet to be confirmed  however 
Thanks to this decent but not terrible report  shares of ANF are up about almost 9  in mid morning trading 
Best Buy   NYSE BBY

Shares of WSM rallied over 9  immediately after the retailer s report was released after the bell yesterday  though the stock is now down about 0 26  today in mid morning trading   for Zacks  analysis on Williams Sonoma s Q1 earnings 
Bottom Line
Even though these recent earnings reports may seem like the retail industry has potentially found its footing again  that notion is pretty unlikely  Realistically  it s a lot of retailers reporting results that were not as bad as anticipated  and investor relief is strikingly apparent 
But while many companies like Macy s   NYSE M   disappointed this season  there were some retailers  like Best Buy  that made concentrated efforts to turn their businesses around  with some brands  instead of closing old locations  And  bright spots like Home Depot   NYSE HD   and Walmart   NYSE WMT   are showing investors that there is still hope against a giant like Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN

128318,349833,ANF,Jobs Report Friday,opinion,"DOW   186   20 071SPX   16   2297NAS   30   5666RUT   19   137710 Y    02   2 49 Oil    55   54 09Gold   3 60   1220 00
The economy gained 227 000 new jobs in January  up from 157 000 in December  The unemployment rate rose to 4 8  from 4 7   mostly because more people were looking for work  Job openings are near a record high and that s drawing a larger share of Americans back into the labor force 
Revised estimates from December and November cut 39 000 jobs from the total payroll increases  There were 157 000 new jobs created in December instead of 156 000  November s gain was chopped to 164 000 from 204 000  Year over year in January  the economy gained 2 34 million jobs 
In January  hourly wages rose just 0 1    or 3 cents  to  26 an hour  The average workweek was unchanged at 34 4 hours  Slow growth in wages brought the year over year pace back down to 2 5   after rising at a 2 9  clip in December 
And while that is higher than the 1 6  pace of inflation  we just aren t seeing wage push inflationary pressures  meaning wages are not causing inflation  suggesting there is still slack in the labor market 
Still  certain jobs and sectors are very tight indeed  Many small and medium sized businesses are facing labor shortages  especially for tech workers  And we are seeing a generational shift for skilled workers  such as mechanics and welders  and there have been some shortages because we got away from training and apprenticeship programs 
At the low end of the pay scale  local minimum wage increases   ranging from as little as 5 cents an hour in Florida and Alaska to  1 95 an hour in Arizona   affected approximately 4 3 million workers across 19 states in January 
The widest impact was felt in Arizona  California  and Washington  where more than 1 in 10 workers got a raise  Still  not enough to make a difference in wages  and apparently not a cause to cut back on hiring 
The causes behind the  aren t easily pinned down  While the government s annual bench marking process might have had some trickle down effect  the turning over of the calendar year also could share the blame 
Bonus season probably results in some fluctuation in reporting on pay  with businesses revising those increases back down when end year plans changed  The lower than expected reading on pay could also be attributed to the mix of jobs that were added  such as retail  which are generally low paying jobs 
One possible reason for flat wages is the lack of labor mobility  Firm specific wages are evidence of an uncompetitive labor market  After all  if workers could move freely between firms  that should equalize the pay workers of similar experience and education obtain across firms within an industry or geography 
And   to workers in narrowly defined skill and experience groups  the more residual inequality is apparent  If you only have one firm where you can use your skills  a condition known as monopsony  the result is flat wages 
One reason for monopsony might be anti compete clauses  Another reason might be that many people were locked into their homes in the Great recession  unable to move due to negative equity  resulting in a lack of labor mobility 
 in the labor force is still at historical lows  The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  was at 62 9 percent in January  the highest level since September 
A broader measure of unemployment which includes discouraged workers and people working part time but would prefer full time  the U 6 unemployment rate rose to 9 4   There are about 5 8 million unemployed or underemployed  and the number of people working part time for economic reasons increased  suggesting there is still some slack in the labor market 
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 5 000 jobs  rising for a second straight month as the oil related drag on the sector eases  Construction employment jumped 36 000  the largest increase since March  after December s paltry 2 000 gain 
An unusually high number of people said poor weather in trades such as construction prevented them from working in December  Those jobs usually turn up  statistically speaking  in the following month 
Retail payrolls  surprisingly surged 46 000  the biggest rise since February  Retailers  including Macy s  NYSE M   Sears  NASDAQ SHOS   American Apparel  and Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  announced job cuts in January amid store closures  Department store sales are being undercut by online retailers  led by Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  
So why the bump in retail employment  Well retailers hired fewer people than usual for the holiday season  meaning they probably laid off fewer workers in January as well 
Financial activities added 32 000 jobs last month  Professional and technical services rose by 23 000  Employment in food and hospitality increased by 30 000  And health care added 18 000 
Government employment fell for a fourth straight month in January  Further declines are likely after the Trump administration enforced a hiring freeze on civilian federal government workers on Jan  22 
The head of the Congressional Budget Office  Keith Hall told the House Budget Committee that this year s federal deficit will drop to  559 billion  down from a deficit of  587 billion in fiscal 2016  but will explode to  1 4 trillion a year by 2027 
The deficits are expected to grow above 3  of GDP after 2019  in part because of an insufficient labor force associated with retiring baby boomers  and the continued growth in spending  The nonpartisan office based its projections on the assumption on current laws remaining in place  the agency does not speculate on the effect of proposed legislation on the deficit 
The January Jobs Report marks the end of the Obama Administration and the beginning of the Trump Administration tracking the labor market  And while Trump took credit for the jobs gained in January  it wasn t that long ago that he declared the unemployment rate a phony  totally fictitious number  He claimed the real unemployment rate was not somewhere under 5  but rather closer to 42   which is nowhere near reality 
Still  Trump has an almost valid point  even if his math is imaginary  Trump s skepticism toward the unemployment rate is clearly rooted in political self interest if he treated the number as legitimate  he would have to acknowledge that the economy improved significantly under President Obama  By undermining public trust in government data  he also makes it harder for anybody to hold his administration accountable for the economy s performance 
The new president promises his plans will create 25 million new jobs in the next decade  It would be the most jobs created under any U S  president ever  topping even the nearly 23 million jobs added under President Bill Clinton during the boom years of the 1990s 
That won t be easy  and it almost certainly will not happen  First  the population is aging  boomers are retiring  there just aren t enough young workers to replace the boomers  certainly not without massive immigration  Next  automation is coming  robots will be doing more and more work  Robots are not counted in the Jobs Report 
Next  the rest of the global economy has slowed   it s not just America  It won t be easy to manufacture 4  growth in the US  while the rest of the world slogs along  Good luck  but don t hold your breath 
Meanwhile  back to those fictitious unemployment numbers  Trump has a point  4 8  unemployment rate is misleading  the economy is not nearly as rosy as that number would suggest  Like all economic indicators  it has shortcomings  and those weaknesses have grown more problematic since the Great Recession  If an administration wanted to benchmark its economic performance by focusing on a single headline statistic  this might be a good time to pick a new one 
Fortunately  the Labor Department has six different measures U 1 through U 6  the headline number  the number cited most often is U 3 which is now at 4 8   a person is lumped into that category if they ve looked for a job in the past 12 months but not in the past four weeks 
Known as discouraged workers  these people are included in a different jobless rate called U5  which is about one full percentage point higher than the official unemployment rate  Pick a number  any number  just realize that one number is apples  and the other is oranges 
Perhaps more important is if the Federal Reserve realizes that the U 3 rate of 4 8  does not mean we are at full employment  The labor market has changed  and will continue to change  And there is no reason to slow down job growth through monetary policy 
On Wednesday  the Fed kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in a range of 0 50 percent to 0 75 percent  It said it expected labor market conditions would strengthen  somewhat further   which is exactly what happened  There s still a very strong resistance from firms to pay higher wages 
There s a gradual uptrend  but you re not seeing rapid wage growth  The weak increase in wages means there is no problem with wage push inflationary pressures  So  it doesn t appear that anything in today s Jobs Report will change the Fed s gradualist policy path for rate hikes 
A little bit more news to cover today  President Trump signed executive orders to review the Dodd Frank Wall Street reforms and halt a Labor Department rule designed to curb potential conflicts among brokers who give retirement advice  The Dodd Frank executive order will ask the Treasury secretary to work with other regulators to determine what the administration can do to fix issues with measures issued under the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street reform law 
The Labor Department s retirement advice rule requires brokers to act as  fiduciaries   or in their clients  best interests  when they are advising them about their individual retirement accounts and 401K plans  A presidential order imposed a 180 day delay on the implementation of that rule 
The Trump administration also imposed sanctions on 25 individuals and entities  ratcheting up pressure on Iran in what it said were just  initial steps  and said it would no longer turn a  blind eye  to Iran s hostile actions ",2017-02-05,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jobs-report-friday-200174677,200174677

toxic stocks is short lived as their current price exceeds their inherent value and these stocks are bound to result in loss for investors over time Higher price of the toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks  If you own such stocks for a long period of time  you are bound to see a significantloss in your wealth If you can  however  accurately figure outthetoxic stocks  you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling  This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls While short selling excels in bear markets  it typically loses money in bull markets So  just like identifying stocks with growth potential  pinpointing toxic stocks and dumping them at the right time is the key to safeguard your portfolio from big losses or make profits by short selling them Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you identify overpriced toxic

Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU    Information Technology   Internet  Software   Services
Investors are slowly losing hope that Baidu will ever come close to Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOGL  success in the United States  The oft referred to  Google of China  is coming off yet another disappointing quarter  Earnings climbed by 4  after 4 consecutive quarters of negative growth  Revenue on the other hand  slid 5  due to higher acquisition  bandwidth and content costs  Baidu s offline to online model coupled with lower interest from advertisers to use the search engine have taken the biggest toll on results lately  On a positive note  Baidu is prepared to test its first self driving car in the coming weeks  If Baidu can successfully develop and deploy the first wave of driverless vehicles that could cause investors to overlook its weak search business  Nonetheless  the Estimize community is pessimistic about the fourth quarter  Analysts are calling for earnings of 90 cents on  2 57 billion  reflecting a 12  decline on the bottom line and 5  on the top 
Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF    Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail
Abercrombie has a knack for disappointing investors given its recent string of disappointing quarterly results  The teen retailer is clearly having trouble navigating this retail environment that favors fast fashion trends and discounters  both of which do not represent Abercrombie s core offerings  Meanwhile  mall based traffic continues to see a sharp downturn due to the proliferation of online channels  The third quarter featured many of these ongoing trends as same store sales dropped by 6  across U S  and international locations  Hollister stores was the lone bright spot during the quarter  delivering flat growth from a year earlier and only a 1  decline in comps year to date  Estimize contributors are down on the retailer s performance during the key holliday months  Analysts are calling for earnings of 81 cents  6  lower than a year earlier  That estimate has dropped 27  in the past 3 months  Revenue for the period is forecasted to drop 4  to  1 04 billion 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX    Health Care   Pharmaceuticals
The Valeant story has been told multiple times over the past year after a pricing gouging scandal caused shares to hit rock bottom  With several new board members  one being infamous hedge fund manager Bill Ackman  and a new CEO  Valeant continues to fumble  Valeant s massive debt load along with a weak pipeline have held back most investors from jumping back into the stock  To combat its mounting debt  Valeant is exploring options to sell its stomach drug business for about  10 billion  This would handle a large portion of its bank loans and remove a big area of concern for prospective investors  What it won t do is boost financial performance  which analyst s forecast to edge down in the fourth quarter  The Estimize community is forecasting a 30  decline on the bottom line to  1 66 per share and 10  on the top to  2 43 billion  Shares are down nearly 85  from a year earlier and historically drop an additional 2  immediately following an earnings report 
Ford Motor  NYSE F    Consumer Discretionary   Automobiles
While General Motors  NYSE GM  continues to thrive in this environment  Ford s experience has been the exact opposite  The company is coming off a third quarter report that featured a 42  decline on the bottom line along with flat growth  Ford s mishaps come amid a pullback in production across North American markets  Domestic markets should continue to see some downside as gas prices and interest rates are set to rise in the coming months  Meanwhile  currency headwinds will take a toll on international performance  which has held together quarterly results lately  The Estimize community believes Ford will its decline during the fourth quarter  Analysts are forecasting a 31  decline on the bottom line to 37 cents per share on a 6  drop on the top to  35 71 billion 
Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN    Consumer Discretionary   Internet   Catalog
Amazon doesn t frequently make an appearance on lists that touch on losers or most likely to miss earnings estimates  but the upcoming quarterly results appear to be stacking up against the online retailer  Amazon is coming off a relatively lackluster third quarter that featured a miss on the bottom line and revenue in line with consensus estimates  For a company that so frequently smashes analyst s estimates  this was the equivalent missing by 10   Furthermore  guidance for the fourth quarter came in slightly below expectations mostly due to weak operating income and margins  Amazon s ongoing initiatives to expand in almost every facet of its business will inevitably put pressure on margins  which is seeing downward revisions of late  Earnings estimates dropped by 30  to  1 54 following its weak third quarter results with revenue largely in line with previous forecasts  It s becoming more apparent that investors expect nothing short of the best from Amazon where despite its greatness  certain financial metrics are simply unattainable

128370,349885,ANF,Abercrombie  ANF  Stock Down On Wider Loss   Soft Sales,opinion,Abercrombie   Fitch Co  s   NYSE ANF   shares plunged over 13  in the pre market trading session after the company reported dismal second quarter fiscal 2016 results  A soft sales performance due to traffic headwinds at its U S  flagship and tourist locations stores were primarily responsible for the quarter s weakness The company s quarterly adjusted loss per share of 25 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents and the prior year quarter loss of 12 cents  Results for the quarter included an impact of nearly 8 cents per share from adverse currency exchange rates  Including certain one time items  Abercrombie reported a loss per share of 19 cents compared with a loss of 1 cent per share in the year ago quarter ABERCROMBIE Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Quarter in DetailNet sales were down nearly 4  year over year to  783 2 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  789 million  The decline reflects a 7  drop in domestic sales to about  478 8 million and nearly flat international sales of  304 4 million  Also brand wise  sales for Abercrombie fell 5  to  363 1 million while sales at Hollister declined 4  to  420 1 million However  net sales of the company benefited from a 23  contribution from its direct to consumer and omni channel businesses in the reported quarter Comparable store sales  comps  slipped 4  owing to lower traffic  particularly at its flagship and tourist locations in the U S  However  comps gained from the strength in its direct to customer business  on both domestic and international fronts  along with comps recovery at its Hollister European business  including the U K  Also  the conversion trend remained solid in both channels  by brand and geography The Abercrombie brand recorded comparable sales decline of 7   while Hollister witnessed a 2  fall Adjusted gross margin contracted 20 basis points in constant currency to 64 8   mainly backed by higher average unit costs and partly offset by higher average unit retails  Additionally  constant currency gross margin was largely stable due to tight expense and inventory controls FinancialsAbercrombie ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  455 6 million  long term borrowings of  285 5 million  and shareholders  equity of  1 232 2 million  As of Jul 30  2016  inventories were  453 2 million  down nearly 5 3  from the prior year quarter On Aug 17  management declared a quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents per share  payable on Sep 12  to shareholders on record as of Sep 2 Store UpdateDuring the fiscal second quarter  the company introduced two stores in the U S   including one namesake and one Hollister store  while it opened two new international Hollister stores  Also  the company closed two namesake and one Hollister stores  both in the U S  With this  the company operated 744 stores in the U S  and 182 stores across Canada  Europe  Asia and the Middle East  as of Jul 30  2016 In fiscal 2016  the company plans to launch 15 stores  comprising 10 stores in international markets  specifically in China  and five domestic stores  Additionally  the company plans to open about six outlet stores in the U S  Apart from this  the company intends to pull down shutters on approximately 60 stores in the U S OutlookFollowing the dismal fiscal second quarter  the company expects comps to remain challenging in the second half of fiscal 2016  due to uneven results from flagship and tourist locations  Further  it expects foreign currency headwinds to hurt sales by nearly  25 million and operating income by  20 million in the fiscal second half  with the largest impact expected in the fiscal third quarter For fiscal 2016  the company expects adjusted gross margin to remain flat at nearly 61 9   while the same is expected to decline in the third quarter due to adverse currency effects Operating expenses for the full fiscal are estimated to fall marginally from the fiscal 2015 levels  as investments in marketing  mainly tilted to the third quarter  will mostly be offset by savings from its expense reduction initiatives  The company expects the effective tax rate in mid to upper 30s  while net income attributable to non controlling interests should come in at about  5 million  Shares outstanding are anticipated at about 68 million The company now expects capital expenditure at the lower end of its previous guidance of  150  175 million  directed toward store openings and updates  direct to

128407,349922,ANF,Why Does Hillary Hate Small Caps ,opinion,"It really is all about competition  It s survival of the fittest  and the  village  couldn t care less about you  That s why most investors shun what s often considered a  Wild West  type market outpost 
She s a  225 000 per hour creature of Wall Street  And we know Wall Street has no time for small caps 
It s all part of our new   improved  bubble wrap society  where helicopter parents  and helicopter money  insulate children  and investors  against any discomfort  edification be damned  There can be no risk 
And so there can be no real reward  of the  success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming  type 
Well  at Wall Street Daily  we re taking an old school approach  inspired by folks like John Wooden  to investing in new school innovation  in the manner of Sir John Templeton 
Sir John was a big advocate of open mindedness  of seeking new paths as the means to market beating returns 
The whole point of the 1939 exercise where he borrowed  10 400 to buy 104 stocks trading below  1 was about picking nations  industries  and companies hitting rock bottom  It s what he called  points of maximum pessimism    to dare where others will not 

 Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming    Coach John Wooden

It s a pretty profound illustration of Sir John s unfailing optimism and his belief in progress  At the same time  there was no clearer proof that he was also a relentless questioner and contrarian 
This type of approach to investing   to life   demands a lot of those who choose it  As Sir John said   I want people to realize that you shouldn t think you know it all  
We sure heard plenty from the know it all set last week 
But let s get to a very basic threshold question  What are we talking about when we talk about small cap stocks 
Let s start with a breakdown of the Russell 2000  the leading small cap benchmark  And we ll compare it to the S P 500  the main gauge of large cap U S  equities 
As of June 30  2016  the top five sectors in the Russell 2000  by market capitalization  were Financial Services  Consumer Discretionary  Technology  Healthcare  and Producer Durables 
The S P 500 was most heavily weighted to Information Technology  Financials  Healthcare  Consumer Discretionary  and Consumer Staples 
The Russell 2000 has posed three   five   and 10 year average returns of 7 1   8 4   and 6 2   respectively  The S P 500 s marks are 11 7   12 1   and 7 4  
The average market cap for the Russell 2000 as of June 30 was  1 722 billion  the median market cap was  679 million  and the largest stock s market capitalization was  4 245 billion 
Meanwhile  a company has to have a  5 3 billion market cap just to be eligible for the S P 500  which captures about 80  of available market capitalization  The average market cap for the S P 500 was  37 794 billion  the median was  18 126 billion  and the largest stock was  523 641 billion 

 I want people to realize that you shouldn t think you know it all    Sir John Templeton

From a fundamentals perspective  the Russell 2000 is cheaper on a price to book basis at 1 95 versus the S P 500 s 2 77 
The Russell 2000 reports price to earnings excluding negative earnings  the reported P E ratio is 23 64  The S P 500 as of June 30 was priced at 23 83 times trailing 12 month earnings 
The Russell 2000 includes recognizable names such as Abercrombie   Fitch Co   NYSE ANF   Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Angie s List Inc   NASDAQ ANGI  and Noodles   Co   NASDAQ NDLS  
Those are all names with solid businesses that may one day accomplish what Church   Dwight Co   NYSE CHD   the home of Arm   Hammer baking soda  did  Grow out of the small cap designation 
Over time  stock prices follow earnings  That s what happened with Church   Dwight 
One way to limit the risk of investing in small caps is to focus on companies that have cash on their balance sheets and can  therefore  self fund their growth  Volatility is limited because they don t need access to capital markets during crises 
So we do like free cash flow and strong balance sheets 
But we also look for something about the business that s unique  innovative 
Emergent BioSolutions Inc   NYSE EBS   for example  combines positive cash flow generation  a solid balance sheet  and a first mover role in the increasingly critical biodefense subsector 
The company s largest product  BioThrax  is the only FDA licensed vaccine for the prevention of anthrax 
And subscribers to VentureCap Strategist have enjoyed a 158  gain on USA Technologies Inc   NASDAQ USAT  
USA Tech is still enjoying  sweet spot  status amid the long term trend toward cashless  electronic payments at a host of self service or small ticket  unattended retail  locations  such as vending machines  laundry facilities  car washes  and parking garages 
Upticks  Downticks
The Russell 2000 added 7 points  or 0 5   last week to finish at 1219 94  6 2  below its all time high 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics  12 3 million Americans had payroll jobs in manufacturing in June  That s down about 30 000 from June 2015  off nearly 1 9 million from June 2006  and down 4 9 million from 1996  In the past 20 years America has shed 28  of its manufacturing jobs 
Over the past 100 years  the Industrial Production Index  prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis to measure the value of the output of the manufacturing  mining  and utilities industries  has risen steadily  even over the last several decades  That s because manufacturing in the U S  become a disproportionately high end activity  concentrated in heavy machinery  tools  and cars 
The Bank of Japan  disappointed  observers by not announcing a  helicopter money  flight plan  But extraordinarily easy monetary policy got even more extraordinarily easy  as the BoJ did increase the size of its ETF purchases and expand the scope of its dollar lending facility  Wall Street s dope fiends wanted more  though 
After 18 months in negative territory the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index breached zero on July 8  Economic growth hasn t accelerated  but the data have been better than expected  And  upside surprise  is good for stocks  The June ISM PMI came in at 53 2 versus a consensus expectation of 51 4  and the June Employment Situation report showed 287 000 net new jobs versus a forecast of 175 000

128410,349925,ANF,After Q2 Profit Boost  Should You Buy American Eagle  AEO  Stock ,opinion,"On Wednesday  popular teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters   NYSE AEO   reported its fiscal 2016 second quarter results  Diluted earnings per share of 23 cents beat the Zacks estimate of 21 cents and increased a whopping 35  year over year  Total net revenue also beat our consensus estimate  coming in at  823 million for the quarter and gaining 3  year over year 
Despite these results  AEO stock was down 5  in early morning trading  though it appears the stock is gaining some of this loss back as the day moves on   suggesting that investors were not completely satisfied with the company s performance
Consolidated comparable sales grew 3   down from an 11  increase seen in the prior year  Weak comps growth may be the reason for AEO s downward movement today 
Gross profit saw a significant boost  increasing 8  to  307 million and expanding 160 basis points to 37 3   This rise was driven by an improved merchandise margin thanks to lower cost and higher realized selling prices 
Operating income rose 29  to  69 million  compared to  53 million seen in the same quarter last year  operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 8 3  
In a statement  CEO Jay Schottenstein  said   For the past few years  we have worked hard to lift our brands through merchandise leadership and innovation  strengthen our customer focus and invest in technology  Our efforts around these priorities are clearly paying off  as again evidenced by our strong earnings growth in the second quarter  
 As we enter the fall season  our execution  focus and market opportunities are greater than ever  In today s evolving retail landscape  we are committed to offering the very best product and customer experience to position AEO s brands as leaders in a new generation of successful retail brands  Schottenstein continued  
Looking ahead  management expects Q3 earnings to fall in the range of 40 cents to 41 cents per share  based on anticipated low single digit increase in comps 
Should You Buy AEO Stock 
This quarter marks the seventh consecutive period that American Eagle has beat estimates on its bottom line  and despite a two year sales slump  the retailer is finally starting a much needed turnaround 
American Eagle has recently been highlighting its denim products  and its Aerie brand is a very popular stop for women s intimate apparel and loungewear  Comparable sales of Aerie jumped 24  in the second quarter  much higher than expectations of 13 7  
The company is also apt at quickly responding to changing fashion trends  something their customer base desires  and something their competitors like Gap   NYSE GPS   and Abercrombie   NYSE ANF   have trouble executing successfully 
In terms of estimate revision activity  American Eagle has seen a wave of positive change  For the next quarter  both its top and bottom line are looking to see year over year growth  while its current fiscal year has seen two positive revisions within the last 30 days  Make sure to keep an eye on these revisions in the near future  Currently  AEO is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  AMER EAGLE OUTF Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 22 cents on  820 03million in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  3 million on the top
The American Eagle portfolio of established brands should continue to reach its target customers  led by its Aerie Brand
Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy from hold ahead of its report  citing strength in its women s brand and upside in Aerie s brand  amongst other factors
Teen retailers have bounced back in recent quarters after years slowing growth  American Eagle has been at the forefront of the recovery with steadily improving earnings and sales growth  Last quarter the company topped expectations by 4 cents on the bottom line and nearly  20 million on the top  Early signs point to another strong report from American Eagle early Wednesday morning 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 22 cents  27  higher than the same period last year  That estimate has increased 4  since American Eagle s most recent report in May  Revenue is anticipated 2  higher to  820 03 million  making 7 straight quarters of positive gains  Typically the market doesn t react to earnings  good or bad  On average shares have been flat through earnings only to increase by 1  in the month following a report 

After a tough few years  American Eagle has finally started to turn things around  Last quarter saw strong growth across its key brands  Consolidated comparable sales grew 6  supported by a 36  increase in its Aerie brand and 4  growth in core American Eagle products  The American Eagle portfolio of established brands should continue to reach its target customers  led by its Aerie Brand  Additionally  the company has widened its global footprint after seeing strong profitability in international markets 
The biggest concerns this quarter are likely to come from stiff competition and stronger dollar  Names like Gap Inc  NYSE GPS  and Abercrombie   Fitch Company  NYSE ANF  are two of its most direct competitors with online retailers and fast fashion brands indirectly stealing away sales  Meanwhile  the strong dollar will likely eat away at overseas revenue like it has for many other retailers
Just ahead of its report  Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy from hold citing strength in women s merchandising  upside at Aerie  improvement in men s segment and online acceleration

And like most American shoppers  Jacob looks up and rolls his eyes before walking out of the store  Once Cal catches up to him  Jacob grips his face with both hands and tells him  Cal  be better than the Gap  
Be better than the Gap  Ouch 
The Golden Era of Minimal Cool
Gap  the namesake subsidiary of Gap  Inc    NYSE GPS    used to be cool  It was so cool that actress Sharon Stone  a classic Gap white buttoned shirt with a lilac Vera Wang skirt to the 1998 Oscars  It was a brand that was quintessentially American  boosting the popularity of simple staple wardrobe pieces like t shirts and khakis 
In the 1990s  the retailer hired merchandising star Mickey Drexler as CEO  and under his leadership  Gap rose meteorically to become an iconic part of the decade s pop culture  Back then  Gap held great power over American fashion  It not only followed trends  but also set them  Gap was the epitome of effortless chic 
Drexler shattered the myth that good taste had to be expensive  He gave the masses a way to look good and fashionable without going broke  and in the process  he both changed the way the world dressed and built Gap into a  14 5 billion behemoth 
Despite his retail finesse  as well as game changing advertising campaigns think    and     each starring cultural icons Drexler was eventually fired due to a series of bad business calls  Increased competition from imitators like Abercrombie   Fitch   NYSE ANF   made Gap steer away from its well known basics to cropped t shirts  low rise pants  and brighter colors  all in a disastrous effort to stand out 
Killer Promotions
The new decade saw Gap lose  or really  forget  its core brand identity  an identity in which it forged a retail empire  The company lost itself in the changing times and the struggling economy  and it failed to keep up with a market dominated by millennials  Instead of appealing to this new and incredibly influential consumer  Gap focused on its original Generation X customer base 
Their product  however  appealed to neither 
The number of retail choices shoppers have to choose from have increased exponentially over the past years  crowding the market enough that consumers began to look past Gap for their wardrobe basics  spending their money at popular fast fashion chains like H M  Zara  and Uniqlo where the product has good quality at a good price 
Which  funnily enough  is what made Gap so special back in the  90s 
As a result  Gap  as well as its other subsidiaries Banana Republic and Old Navy  have resorted to heavy promotions to get customers back in its stores  Eye catching signs promoting 30   40   or even 50  off your purchase dominate store windows and entrances on a daily basis 
Promotions can be useful tools for retailers  They are a relatively easy way to draw consumers into their stores in order to get rid of inventory or products that don t sell well at full price  But Gap took promotions to an extreme level  and ultimately killed what was left of its brand 
With its constant discounting  the company taught its customers to never buy anything at full price  Because if you wait just one more day to buy that blouse or pair of jeans  there will most likely be some promotion online or in store discounting those items 
This  more than anything  crushed Gap 
The Shaky Future of Gap
With this backdrop  Gap s first quarter fiscal 2016 financial results were   And   Gap s sales have been getting slammed by decreasing foot traffic  During Q1  global Gap sales fell 3   Banana Republic sales dropped 11   and Old Navy sales were down 6  
So what can Gap do differently 
Answered bluntly  literally everything  Gap is in a rut  They rely too much on promotions  Their product feels dated  boring even  They ve become   but can t figure out how to market the basic clothing items that made them famous  For Gap to win over and grow its consumer base again  it needs to dig deep into what once made its brand successful  but also keep in mind that times and retail strategies have changed 
More and more  fashion is turning digital  and connecting with technology is crucial for Gap going forward  The mobile experience needs to be a core focus for the company  Current CEO Art Peck  this will be challenging  as Gap is much farther behind than many of its competitors  The retailer should take advantage of mobile based apps like Instagram and Snapchat in order to promote their products  and even Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   which Peck the company would consider utilizing to reach customers 
It s imperative for Gap to connect with Millennials and even Generation Z  which are much different shoppers than those in Generation X  The retailer used to thrive because it understood who their core audience was  Gap can appeal to Millennial and Generation Z shoppers by not only increasing their social media presence  but also revamping its mobile app  building a  Buy Online  Pick up In store  option  and creating a loyalty program instead of pushing its store credit card 
Perhaps Gap is going through some growing pains  It s heyday in the 1990s was the time of its carefree  buoyant youth  Now actually  for the past 15 years or so is Gap s awkward  sometimes hard to watch teenage years  riddled with braces  acne  and a crippling case of self doubt  If there was hope for any of us during our young adulthood  then there is certainly hope for Gap ",2016-05-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-gap-fell-from-grace-200132458,200132458

Abercrombie hasn t looked back after parting ways with its founder and CEO in 2014
The retail space has taken a beating this season but that hasn t stopped teen retailers from their steady comeback  Earlier this month  American Eagle Outfitters Inc  NYSE AEO  trounced expectations with its first quarter results  setting a favorable stage for Abercrombie coming into its report  Abercrombie is scheduled to report first quarter earnings tomorrow  before the opening bell  With a string of better than expected earnings and positive momentum from American Eagle s Q1 report  early indications look as if Abercrombie is poised for another strong quarter

On Thursday morning before the market opened  Abercrombie   Fitch announced first quarter earnings that missed analyst expectations and sent shares tumbling in the premarket session  The company announced first quarter earnings of a 59 cent loss per share on  685 5 million in revenues while analyst were looking for a loss of just 51 cents per share on  709 million in revenues  Investors are not happy with these results and it is reflecting in the share price as the stock is currently trading at  22 after closing Wednesday at  25 08  a 12 2  drop in price  Currently analyst have an average price target of  28 44 but we should see that number come down after this release 
Looking at the chart you will see that shares have been under heavy selling pressure for the past couple months and especially this morning after the disappointing Q1 earnings release  Shares are now trading well below their 200 day moving average that is currently sitting at  24 85 and are looking to open at a key pivot level at  22  If shares can t hold that level then we may be in for another push down with the next support level coming in at  21  If we hold  22 and push back up we will run into some resistance at  22 55 and  23 50  This will be an active stock today so keep an eye out for some intra day opportunities 
CEO Comments
Arthur Martinez  Executive Chairman  said 

Our results for the quarter reflect significant traffic headwinds  particularly in international markets and in our U S  flagship and tourist stores  resulting in negative comparable sales  However  in the face of these headwinds  we were encouraged by our U S  business  where comparable sales improved in the Hollister brand  and gross margin rate increased meaningfully for both brands  Overall  our business remains well managed in these challenging times  with our assortment and customer centricity efforts driving improved conversion  and expense and inventory well controlled 
We expect the second quarter to remain challenging  but to see better results in the back half of the year as our assortments continue to improve and we see returns from significant investments in marketing  store management and omnichannel  In addition  with the new brand presidents and other key roles now filled  we have a strong team in place to drive our brands forward and capitalize on the many opportunities we see ahead of us

On a constant currency basis  revenues increased 4  to  119 4 billion  E commerce sales increased approximately 7  globally on a constant currency basis  However  e commerce growth was weaker than the preceding quarter s growth of 8  due to a challenging scenario in key international markets

Operating income declined 7 1  to  5 28 billion in the first quarter  On a constant currency basis  operating income declined 4 6   as the company continued to invest in people and technology  Besides currency  higher investment in e commerce initiatives in order to compete with online retailer Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   and in associates through higher wages and training seem to have dampened operating income 
Segment Details
Wal Mart U S   The segment posted net sales growth of 4 3  to  73 3 billion in the quarter  including the impact of fuel sales  Operating income however declined 8 8  to  4 2 billion  as the company incurred huge expenses as a result of e commerce initiatives and higher wages and training

Neighborhood Market comps also increased approximately 7 1   with strong customer growth  E commerce sales positively impacted comp sales at Wal Mart U S  by 0 20  in the quarter 
Wal Mart International  Segment net sales  including fuel sales  declined 7 2  year over year to  28 1 billion  It however increased 4 3  on a constant currency basis to  31 6 billion  led by strong performance in Mexico and Canada  Operating income  on the other hand  grew 8 8  to  1 16 billion  On a constant currency basis  it soared 22  
Sam s Club  The segment  which comprises membership warehouse clubs  posted net sales growth  including fuel impact  of 1  to  13 6 billion  Sam s Club operating income however decreased 3 3  to  413 million in the quarter

Guidance
Second Quarter Fiscal 2017
In the second quarter of fiscal 2017  earnings are expected in a range of 95 cents to  1 08 per share  compared with the prior year quarter s earnings of  1 08 per share 
Wal Mart expects U S  comp sales growth of around 1  for the 13 week period ending Jul 29 compared with 1 5  comps growth last year 
Sam s Club comp sales  without the impact of fuel sales  are expected to be slightly positive compared with 1 3  growth last year 
Fiscal 2017
The company has not updated its fiscal 2017 guidance but had stated at the annual investor day in October that fiscal 2017 sales will remain flat due to stronger than anticipated negative impact of the dollar and store closures globally  Excluding the impact of currency and store closures  the company expects net sales growth in a range of 3  to 4   Currency is expected to hurt sales by  12 billion 
Further  Wal Mart expects its earnings in a range of  4 00 to  4 30 per share  compared with  4 57 per share posted in fiscal 2016  The decline in year over year growth is due to higher wages and increased spending on e commerce activities  Higher wages and training costs are expected to negatively hurt earnings by 30 cents per share  while currency is expected to hurt earnings by 10 cents 
Our Take
Though the company is making efforts to boost its sales and regain investors  confidence  it still faces many headwinds  which will reduce earnings in the near term  Higher expenses  lower margins at Wal Mart U S  and currency headwinds are also expected to negatively impact results 
Wal Mart carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

Adjusted gross margin expanded 10 basis points  bps  to 28 7  in the quarter owing to a favorable product sales mix with higher gross margin rates offsetting the decrease in gross profit margin rates in all categories except home products  The decrease in gross margin rates was primarily due to free delivery in appliances and a continued promotional environment

However  selling  general and administrative  SG A  expense ratio decreased 50 bps to 24 2  due to decreases in wages and employee benefits as a result of efficiencies in the company s labor structure  and decrease in bank transaction fees  Loss of consulting fees also resulted in the decline  This was partially offset by fees associated with increases in delivery services and higher occupancy cost 
Adjusted EBITDA increased to  0 16 million in the fourth quarter as against a loss of  7 8 million in the prior year fourth quarter  We note that the improved EBITDA was due to the company s expense reduction initiatives

Computers and Tablets Category  Same store sales in this category declined 32 2  in the quarter  narrower than a decline of 37 6  in the last year quarter  The decline was due to a decrease in unit demand as well as lower average selling prices for computers and tablets 
Home Products  Same store sales in this category increased 2 8  in the quarter as against a decline of 12 5  in the prior year quarter  The improved performance was driven by higher average selling prices offset by a decline in unit demand in the category

Factors Influencing this QuarterAbercrombie   Fitch witnessed solid trends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  which helped it in beating on earnings and sales  and reporting positive comparable sales  Despite the adverse currency movements  the company s results gained from its strategies of developing omni channel capacities  focus on key merchandise and design processes and optimization of store fleet Going forward  management anticipates these solid trends to continue and bode well for Abercrombie s performance  Also  the company expects the strong trend from the Hollister brand and global performance  as witnessed in the last quarter  to continue  All these factors make us constructive on Abercrombie   Fitch s upcoming results However  the company expects foreign currency headwinds to linger and impact results in fiscal 2016  Further  stiff competition from other players and macroeconomic headwinds remain concerns Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Abercrombie   Fitch is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Abercrombie   Fitch is currently  4 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 52 cents per share is wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents loss per share Zacks Rank  Abercrombie   Fitch carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of  4 00  makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release Dave   Buster s Entertainment Inc    NASDAQ PLAY    expected to report earnings on Jun 13  has an Earnings ESP of  3 39  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Nike Inc    NYSE NKE    expected to report earnings on Jun 23  has an Earnings ESP of  2 08  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Carnival  LON CCL  Corporation   NYSE CCL    expected to report earnings on Jun 28  has an Earnings ESP of  5 26  and a Zacks Rank  3 ",2016-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-currency-woes-hit-abercrombie-(anf)-in-q1-earnings-200130703,200130703

fiscal 2016 results  The company posted quarterly earnings of 59 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents but declined 3 3  from 61 cents earned in the year ago quarter  The year over year decline in adjusted earnings were primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency headwinds  incremental interest expenses and pre opening costs for the flagship Victoria s secret store  Foreign currency headwinds impacted the bottom line by 7 cents a share Despite the earnings beat  the company s shares declined 4 8  in after hour trading session yesterday as investors were disappointed after the Columbus  OH based company s tepid earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2016 This specialty retailer of women s intimate and other apparel reported net sales of  2 613 8 million  up 4  from  2 511 9 million in the prior year quarter  However  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 617 million  L Brands recorded comparable sales  including direct sales  growth of 3  during the reported quarter  Store only comps grew 2   We believe that the company s operational efficiencies  together with its new and innovative collections  boosted sales Sales at

merchandise margin rate as well as increase in buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage led to the downside  Adjusted operating income decreased 4  to  357 9 million  while the operating margin fell 110 bps to 13 7   Decline in operating income was mostly due to Victoria s Secret and International Segments Store UpdateDuring reported quarter  L Brands opened five Victoria s Secret stores in total and closed two outlets  thereby taking the count to 1 167 stores  During the period  four Bath   Body Works stores were opened but one was closed  which took the count to 1 675 stores  Also  one

repurchased 3 1 million shares for  260 2 million  At the end of the quarter  the company had  239 8 million remaining under the current share buyback program of  500 million   GuidanceManagement now projects earnings in the band of  3 60  3 80 per share for fiscal 2016  down sharply from the previous guidance of  3 90  4 10 per share  The steep decline in earnings estimate was primarily due to the impact of nearly 20 cents related to the previous announcement of strategic changes and decline in sales trends at Victoria s Secret  The company s earnings will also be affected by nearly 10 cents due to the increase in costs related to the company s plan to develop a wholly owned model from franchise based operating model in China On the other hand  the company expects the fiscal second quarter earnings in the range of 50 cents to 60 cents Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate earnings per share between 67 cents and  4 01 for the second quarter and fiscal 2016  respectively  Going

128538,350053,ANF,Are These Teen Retailers Finally Making A Comeback ,opinion,"The early half of this decade was looking quite grim for teen retailers  Companies including Abercrombie  NYSE ANF  and American Eagle  NYSE AEO  were seeing sharp declines in earnings as preferences were changing  Teens were no longer yearning for the same shirt as their peers  instead they were identifying with new fashion trends as they looked to individualize themselves  Logo centric apparel that Abercrombie and its peers had been churning out since the 90s had fallen by the wayside in favor of unique products  Traffic at malls  where these brands do most of its business  were also reaching all time lows with teens opting for different forms of entertainment 
However  all is not lost as teen retailers appear to be making a comeback  After parting ways with its founder and CEO in 2014  Abercrombie has ushered a new wave of change in the past two years  The company has moved away from its notoriously sexy image  to better position itself in the rapidly changing fashion industry  Abercrombie has been quick to restructure its stores away from the club like ambience of shirtless models and provocative ads for which they had become famous  These efforts have not only impacted its core business  but subsidiaries Hollister and Gilly Hicks as well  Abercrombie recently shut the doors on its Gilly Hicks business and is now pushing Hollister into the burgeoning fast fashion segment  The move into fast fashion should provide Abercrombie an edge over its competitors and also drive top line expansion 
Early indications look as though Abercrombie is finally gaining traction  The company is coming off two consecutive quarters of positive earnings surprises with shares soaring 46  in the past 6 months  This quarter  the Estimize consensus is calling for EPS of  0 97 and revenue of  1 10 billion  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line  Given the weak holiday season  profitability looks as if it will fall short on Wednesday  projected to decline 15  on a YoY basis  That said  the apparel retailer has consistently beat on earnings  eclipsing the Estimize consensus 60  of the time while beating Wall Street 80  of the time 

American Eagle  on the other hand  has been the biggest success story in this category  The company had been one of the earliest adopters of the new age in fashion  turning around its core business to profitability in two years  Last quarter  American Eagle reported a 9  increase in comparable store sales  with gains across both the American Eagle and Aerie brands  The biggest changes American Eagle have made include improving the quality of its products  keeping a leaner inventory and pushing its popular Aerie brand  By keeping inventory at a manageable level  the retailer has been able to reduce the amount of markdowns its offers and vastly improve profit margins 
In contrast to Abercrombie s checkered past  American Eagle has had some PR wins as of late  It s Aerie brand has teamed up with the National Eating Disorders Associations to help promote positive body images  The lingerie brand features women of all shapes and sizes with the hope it will remove the stigma of being too curvy  The campaign has helped propel sales in recent months  further setting it apart from its competition 
The Estimize community has been optimistic in regards to American Eagle  calling for EPS of  0 42 and revenue expectations of  1 11 billion  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line  However our Select Consensus  which more heavily weights historically accurate analysts and recent estimates  is expecting a larger beat by 2 cents  Compared to the same period last year  this predicts as an 18  gain in earnings while sales are expected to grow 4   On average American Eagle has consistently beat expectations  trumping the Estimize community in 92  of earnings reports  
That being said  neither label is in the clear yet  Both Abercrombie and American Eagle continue to lose market share to the rapidly emerging fast fashion brands like H M and Forever 21  These brands have become popular with teens for their fashion forward styles at value prices  A branded polo at Abercrombie  its flagships product  will set you back  50 while a similar style at H M retails between  15 and  20  Despite more modest pricing from the teen retailers in recent years  they still have trouble positioning themselves against discount and fast fashion retailers 
Not everyone has fared as well as Abercrombie and American Eagle  Aeropostale  NYSE ARO   the lowest priced of the three companies  continues to be plagued by its failing strategy  Instead of trying to keep pace with fashion trends  the company remains focused on providing teens with a uniform of basic clothing  So far  this strategy has failed Aeropostale as it continues to post declining comparable sales and announced they would be laying off 13  of their corporate employees 
While Abercrombie and American Eagle have made progress matching teens  preferences  they will have to continue to adapt as to not lose any more ground to the fast fashion industry ",2016-03-02,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-these-teen-retailers-finally-making-a-comeback-(anf,-aeo)-200120067",200120067
128539,350054,ANF,Stocks Gain As Draghi Brings The Bazooka,opinion,"There are always two parts to an equation  different sides of a story  and opposite parts of a coin  The unique nature of markets  and it does not matter what kind we are referencing  is different participants see the same things in their own way  The perspective one has on a market then is expressed with methods used to allocate capital  or not  or how one goes about trying to earn gains  So  when global equity markets started the year off by having the worst six week period in quite some time  much of the investment community expressed their opinion that a recession was guaranteed  and a thirty percent decline was virtually certain  Fast forward six weeks  and after much turbulence  markets sit at the flat line  A thirty or forty percent decline is yet not out of the question  but having endured an interesting ride so far  it does appear equity markets have a chance for a better outcome  so take all prognostications with a grain of salt  In the investment world  everybody talks their book  short or long 
Mario Draghi whipped out  The Bazooka  on Thursday morning and proceeded to tell investors negative interest rate policies were potentially finished  which whipsawed currency markets all over the place  The euro dived  then it strengthened against the dollar  Equities soared  with futures up over 200 points  and then sold off  after mercurial Mario declared the end  of quantitative easing  may be now  Central banks all over the globe continue to engage in a unique form of currency wars  with the weaponry interest rate policy  typically low  or even negative  The whole goal is to stimulate lending and economies to foster some inflation and better growth  The problem is deflation  with excess capacity and too much investment the primary cause  So  like in chemistry class where you neutralize an acid with a base  the same idea applies where to combat deflation you implement plenty of monetary stimulus  I am not saying it is working  just giving the logic  Don t shoot the messanger  please  I m not the enemy 
Earnings season is winding down  with some notable companies reporting this week  Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK  showed their burgers are still tasty but the stock got beat up as the valuation has typically remained  shall we say  full of calories  The sporting goods industry is notable now because of the recent bankruptcy filing of Sports Authority  Loaded up with debt by private equity group Leonard Green Partners  the general sports retailer is closing 140 stores  It appears being a generalist versus providing a unique experience is also an area which needs to be addressed  Leonard and the boys will take care of it  and they have plenty of reasons as incentive     
On the opposite side of the spectrum is the gun industry  Sales have been booming under Mr  Obama s rhetoric about guns  and Smith   Wesson  NASDAQ SWHC  and Ruger  NYSE RGR  have dramatically outperformed market indexes for the last five years  Not advocating an investment  just stating facts  Ulta Salon  NASDAQ ULTA  reported a strong number which destroyed market estimates  which has been a recurring result for those shareholders  It is always a good idea to bet on vanity  and you could also site Estee Lauder  NYSE EL  as another example  Box  NYSE BOX  reported nice numbers  which also indicates the idea of security amongst large enterprises is going to be a strong grower for a while  Nothing wrong with investing in prevention of lawsuits  especially among billion dollar businesses  In the retailing world  Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  finally gave the investment world a decent number  Maybe the new management decided holes in jeans are not a sustainable marketing approach 
In the political world  next week could be the nail in the coffin if delightful Donald wins Florida and Ohio  The weekend s events in Chicago should serve as a reminder of how passionate people are about politics  Mr  Trump made a good decision to forgo his rally with thousands of protesters outside  Let s hope cooler heads prevail and citizens are able to express their views in a peaceful way with no violence as a result

The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 08  in line with Wall Street  with revenue expectations of  643 47 million  roughly  2 million higher than the Street  The Select Consensus on the other hand  is showing a more modest beat of  1 million on the top line  The Estimize community has maintained an optimistic stance on DSW  revising EPS estimates up 9  since the company last reported  Compared to the year prior  current estimates predict a decline in profitability of 75   On average  the company has consistently beat expectations  trumping the Estimize consensus 73  and Wall Street 81  of recorded quarters

Children s Place  NASDAQ PLCE 
Consumer Discretionary   Specialty Retail   Reports March 15  before the open 
Both Estimize and Wall Street are right in line on this one  with EPS expected to come in at  1 11 and revenues anticipated at  500 million  Both of these figures have improved significantly since the company last reported earnings  with the Estimize community increasing their Q4 earnings expectations by 8  and revenues by 4   and an even greater lift from the sell side of 12  and 5  on each of those metrics  respectively  This would project YoY profit growth of 17  and sales growth of 3   And while this name beats on the bottom line around 89  historically  it only beats revenue projections 44  of the time 

What to Watch  After a period of negative top and bottom line growth in 2013 and 2014  The Children s Place returned to the green on earnings in 2015  while revenues remained suppressed  During the third quarter  unseasonably warm weather across most of the US caused same store sales  SSS  to dip 3  compared to the prior year  However  at the time of the announcement on December 8  fourth quarter SSS were running positive at 4 5   representing close to half of the company s planned sales volume for Q4  Despite continued weakness in traffic  early results were positively impacted by increases in key selling metrics  Inventories also showed an improvement at the end of Q3  down 4 4  as compared to the year ago period  Like so many others in the retail space  PLCE continues to invest in its omni channel strategy  with the implementation of a new distributed order management system in the latest quarter  The company plans on closing 200 stores through 2017

What to Watch  Last week  both Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF  and American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  reported strong earnings  signaling a potential turnaround for teen retailers  Since then  shares of Aeropostale have soared and are now up 51 79  year to date  Investors are hoping the positive momentum created by ANF and AEO continues when Aeropostale reports fourth quarter earnings next week  Last quarter the company saw net sales decrease by 20  thanks to 10  declines in comparable sales and e commerce channels  Aeropostale announced that they would be laying off 100 corporate employees in Q4 as part of an effort to lower expenses by  40 million a year  This comes as no surprise given the company has reported a loss in seven of the past eight quarters  Instead of trying to keep pace with fashion trends  the company remains focused on providing teens with a uniform of basic clothing  So far  that strategy has failed ",2016-03-14,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-this-week-3-14---ddd,-dsw,-plce,-ctrp,-aro-200121504",200121504

Workday Inc  NYSE WDAY  
Technology company Workday will post its first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results on Tuesday  May 26 after market close  Wall Street expects the company to post a loss of   0 08  a share and  244 71 million in revenue  up from a loss of   0 13  a share and  159 7 million in revenue the same quarter a year prior 
Workday develops and provides cloud applications for finance and human resources  The company has established itself as one of the fastest growing businesses in the Software as a Service  SaaS  cloud computing space and in Big Data business  Averaging a 70  revenue growth over the past four quarters  Wall Street believes Workday is showing no signs of slowing down 
Additionally  Workday continues to see strong demand for its services and is expected to post a 60  increase in billings growth  Investors will be looking to see if the company will offer a projection of what to expect for the rest of the year 
On average  the overall analyst consensus for Workday on  is Hold 
SeaDrill Limited  NYSE SDRL  
Oil company SeaDrill is slated to post its first quarter 2015 earnings results on Thursday  May 28 after market close  Analysts expect the company to post earnings of  0 62 a share and  1 26 billion in revenue  down from earnings  6 23 per share and  1 221 billion in revenue year over year 
Oil prices in general began to fall dramatically in June 2014  reaching as low as  50 a gallon this past January  Consequently  SeaDrill suspended its dividend several months ago in an effort to create margin safety while oil supply and demand began to even out  Wall Street and investors alike were hopeful that supply and demand would balance out by the end of the year  but now it seems that will not happen for as long as another two years 
Additionally  SeaDrill has already invested billions of dollars into 15 new build vessels  with only a few under contract to enter service over the next 18 months  The company currently has a  13 billion debt  which could grow as its new build vessels enter service 
On average  the overall analyst consensus for SeaDrill on is Moderate Sell 
Abercrombie   Fitch Company  NYSE ANF  
Retailer Abercrombie   Fitch is set to announce its first quarter 2015 earnings results on Thursday  May 28 before the market opens  The company is expected to post a loss of   0 33  a share and  731 million in revenue  compared to a loss of   0 17  a share and  822 43 million in revenue the same quarter last year 
The retail chain was once extremely popular amongst teenagers  but A F has been struggling to keep adolescents interest in its clothing over the past several quarters  In fact  comparable store sales dropped 10  in the last quarter 
The company has also been searching for a new CEO since Mike Jeffries stepped down earlier this year  Investors will be looking for an update on its progress in finding someone to fill the position  Many consumers had a sour taste in their mouth from Mike Jeffries  who came under fire last year for comments about who can and cannot shop at A F  Jeffries wanted the shop to be for  cool kids   and did not stock women s clothing in extra large sizes  Investors hope that Jeffries successor will help turn the company around

128571,350086,ANF,Abercrombie Hopes Change Will Spur Sales,opinion,"Very rarely does the Estimize community have a corporate earnings or revenue consensus that is lower than Wall Street s  but that s the case for Abercrombie   Fitch  NYSE ANF   which is set to report results after Thursday s bell  The Estimize EPS consensus calls for   0 36 vs  Wall Street s   0 34  Revenues of  729M are also below the Street s estimate for  734M 

Abercrombie is well aware of what the issues are  but can it reverse them  It has already ditched logoed gear  which has fallen out of favor with teens and recently announced it is getting rid of suggestive and sexy images that have long been a staple of its marketing strategy  There has also been a push to diversify stores that have traditionally been staffed by preppy  all American employees 

Teen retailers continue to lose market share to the  fast fashion  names such as H   M  LONDON 0HBP   Zara and Forever 21  Fellow teen retailer Aeropostale  NYSE ARO  reported crushing Q1 results last week  with EPS of   0 56 missing analysts  estimates  Revenues also missed  signifying a 20  year over year decline  Not all in this space have been doing poorly  however  as American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  put up superb results last week  beating on both the top and bottom line  and even growing EPS 650  from the year ago quarter 

As for Abercrombie  it hasn t only been struggling in the US  but internationally as well  posting 11 consecutive quarters of negative same store sales    a trend exacerbated by the stronger dollar  The stock is down around 30  this year and could use a positive surprise Thursday  Some news of a new CEO  which it has been without for 5 months ",2015-05-27,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abercrombie-hopes-change-will-spur-sales-253116,253116

128573,350088,ANF,Bubbles  Anyone  ,opinion,"Investment bubbles are not hard to spot  There are times when insanity trumps everything and prices move higher and higher in spite of reality s tethers  Bubbles float on insanity  Wild speculation  Irrational expectations  Hope 
This week that ended 11 20 15 is a good example of another such bubble 
Mass murderers struck Paris and Mali  More retailers reported slower to no growth  The Fed issued more warnings of a December rate increase  Japan lapsed into another recession  Europe is so slow ECB chief Draghi continued his rhetoric of doing anything and everything to save European stocks  Uh  I mean the European economy  And yet  the Dow gained over 3 5  on the weak  What gives 
The explanation from the carnival pundits was that the US was a  safe haven  for investors who were fearful and had no where else to put their money  Really  Well I m going to have to call  bulls  t on that one  The chart below is the emerging markets ETF  the  N EEM   Emerging markets were actually up on this Friday  11 20 15  almost twice as much as the Dow  The pundits are all idiots  Case closed  See the chart 

What could be another rally excuse  Oh yeah  corporate earnings are beating  analysts  expectations  Well   analysts  are more akin to fortune tellers in their prognosticating prowess but that s another story  The analysts are simply Wall Street shills whose function is to generate  buying  opportunities  They do so by lowering expectations so that bloated companies can simple roll over the bar rather than jumping it  A case in point is the clothing retailer Abercrombie and Fitch  N ANF  
The company reported their most recent quarter as such  Check out this quote from the Business News   Abercrombie s sales have fallen for 11 quarters in a row  but the decline has slowed in the past two quarters  signs that business is improving after the company revamped merchandise  improved customers  in store experience and shuffled management   That s right  The writer wants us to believe that business is improving after 11 straight quarterly declines in sales  Business is improving because  according to the writer  sales are not declining as fast as they were  Further  a company executive said that the company remains  cautious  going forward and they expect the holiday sales quarter to be flat compared to last year 
To be fair  Abercrombie did say that income more than doubled due to cost cutting  Cost cutting can only juice earnings for so long  And  as comparison on this day  fellow retailer Gap Inc  N GPS  reported a 2  decline in sales and yet the stock price was up over 7 5   However  Abercrombie was the clear winner  What does 11 straight quarters of declining sales and a tepid holiday quarter prediction get you in a bubble  Of course  The stock price is up over 25  today as I write  See the chart below 

Bubbles are like this  Isaac Newton described the bubble of his era as  the madness of men   True  but what is behind such insanity 
The Federal Reserve Bank comes to mind  The members have all echoed the same warning  They are going to raise interest rates at their next meeting in December  2015  Since their only function is to support Wall Street while they steal all the assets from the feckless US government and her profoundly and profanely ignorant citizens  it seems to me that FRB is goosing the stock indices higher to give themselves a little downside cushion should a selloff great their action  How else could one explain the best weekly stock gain all year for the major indices

ConocoPhillips  N COP  is doing very well  It had a swing put on it  it pulled back  bounced  formed a double top  pulled back again  formed a double bottom  it turned when it held and so did the 50  On Tuesday  it popped out of a wedge  jumping 2 04 to 55 32  or 3 8   on 8 2 million shares  It has 3 1 2 days to cover  Look for it to test and take out 57 1 4  Once it does that the target is 60 
Intra Cellular Therapies  Inc   O ITCI   one of our favorite biotech s right now  had an explosive move on positive news  then a 50  retrace to test support  and it is now moving up steadily in a rising channel  If it gets to the top of the channel to 62 63  that would challenge recent highs at 60 79  Tuesday s high was 57 74  so it s not too far away from the target

The darling of all teen retailers has been struggling for sometime now  with sales declining for the last 7 quarters  as teens move away from preppy logo ed gear in favor of fast fashion retailers such as H M and Zara  Abercrombie s international business has also been a sore spot  one that investors were hoping they could turn around  However  after 10 consecutive quarters of negative international same store sales  many banks have lost their patience and recently downgraded the retailer in part due to slowing global trends and currency headwinds 
And it s not just the business itself  but Abercrombie s public image has somewhat been tainted by senseless comments from former CEO Michael Jeffries as well as it s employee discrimination cases  one that is unfolding right now in the Supreme court  Tomorrow morning investors will be looking for news that a new CEO has been appointed  they will surely have their work cut out for them 
Abercrombie isn t the only teen retailer suffering    NYSE AEO  and    NYSE ARO  which both report next week  have been in the red for several quarters  Many will blame the decline of the American mall where most of these stores are located  Malls are getting less and less foot traffic and the stores located there are increasingly isolated from consumers ",2015-03-04,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-abercrombie-manage-to-eke-out-a-beat-tomorrow-243803,243803

128627,350142,ANF,Abercrombie   Fitch  Weak Quarterly Results Expected ,opinion,"Abercrombie   Fitch Co   NYSE ANF  is set to report FQ1 2015 earnings before the market opens on Thursday  May 29th  Abercrombie and Fitch is a casual clothing retailer that focuses on selling products to a younger audience  This quarter Wall Street is expecting the apparel company s sales to fall 3 6  compared to FQ1 of last year while the FQ1 quarterly loss doubles from  9c to  18c per share   Abercrombie   Fitch has slashed prices to remain competitive in a challenging retail environment and analysts have correspondingly set the earnings bar low for ANF on Thursday  Here s what investors are expecting from Abercrombie   Fitch s earnings release before the opening bell  
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Abercrombie   Fitch to report  18c EPS and  808 37M revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 11 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  17c EPS and  800 43M in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Abercrombie   Fitch to beat Wall Street s earnings estimate by 1c per share but come up  8 million shy on revenue 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Abercrombie   Fitch s EPS and revenue 3 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time 
More importantly  it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB  Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  Here we are seeing a smaller differential than usual between expectations from the two groups 

The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  26c to  10c per share and from  738 00M to  817 84M in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a wide range of estimates for Abercrombie   Fitch  especially on revenue  
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wide range of estimates signals less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus slipped from  17c to  18c while the Estimize consensus bounced around starting at  16c and ending the period at  17c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus decreased from  819 45M to  808 37M while the Estimize consensus sank at the end of the quarter from  811 93M to  800 43M  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst estimate revisions going into the report are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects  15c EPS and  817 84M in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 2nd overall among over 4 500 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60  and 54  of the time respectively throughout a massive 2 706 estimates 
Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is making a relatively bullish call expecting Abercrombie   Fitch to beat the consensus from both Wall Street and Estimize  
So far this earnings season retail sales have generally been weak as they were last season with the exception of a few notable high end fashion companies such as Michael Kors  The poor weather excuse is getting old and if Abercrombie   Fitch can t meet the low expectations from investors  management will have some explaining to do  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are only looking for a loss of 17c per share and revenue of  800 43M compared to  838 8M in revenue 1 year ago ",2014-05-29,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abercrombie---fitch:-weak-quarterly-results-expected-214297,214297
128628,350143,ANF,Volume And Volatility May Be A Signal,opinion,"Long before pundits began to notice  traders have been pointing out the strange trading environment we ve faced in 2014  following the exciting but still unexplained rally of 2013  The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   aka the Fear Index  is at record lows and sitting in a narrow range 
Volume in the S P 500 futures has been as low on some ordinary trading days as it used to be only on holidays  And prices in the major stock indices have often spent the day inside ranges of less than 20 points  Hard to make big money from small moves 

Topping Out At Last 

This lethargy is starting to worry big players  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  President Gary Cohn said the narrow ranges and low volatility mean less commission for his firm and less profitable trading for clients  He told an investor conference   What drives activity in our business is volatility  If markets never move or don t move  our clients really don t need to transact  
Citigroup  NYSE C  and J P Morgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM  are looking at second quarter drops in revenue of 20 25  versus a year ago  for the same reason  Cohn added   We don t have clear vision of economic growth or lack of growth  
Really  44 straight months of private sector job creation  6 3  unemployment  the lowest since October 2008   the SPDR ETF  ARCA SPY  more than doubled since 2009   and you can t see growth  But let s leave Cohn s vision problems aside for now 
A more visible problem is that while stock indices are making new highs  the number of individual stocks making new one year highs has gone down dramatically 
A year ago    of stocks would make new highs when the index did  Now it is just 1 in 19 stocks  In other words  a few booming stocks are pushing the indices higher  but the rest aren t going up anymore 
We noticed a similar phenomenon in the MiM  MrTopStep imbalance Meter  yesterday  The MiM gave a strong sell signal  which many of us in the Trading Room used to get short and make some profits before the close  However  breaking down the buy and sell orders  we saw that 50  of the sell orders were for just two stocks  out of over a hundred  in our proprietary basket 
In short  it s no longer accurate to talk about what  the market  is doing  As a whole  it is doing a whole lot of nothing  But a few stocks and a small number of traders  some human  some algo  are able to move it around because they don t have much volume standing in their way  The tail is wagging the dog  And that s scary 

So if it s scary  the  fear index   the VIX should be high  right  No  it s a lagging indicator  It doesn t say   Warning  Danger Ahead   It says   Uh oh  now you re in trouble  
The VIX won t be of use in predicting the correction  In fact  right now it s saying this is the least worrisome time since 2006  And we all remember what happened next 
So there s a trifecta of sorts to worry about  funds losing money because no one is trading  the markets being driven by an increasingly small number of stocks  and a fear index that seems stuck in Pollyanna mode  None of which seems to have much connection to the reality of most people s lives

Our View
Wow  where has everyone gone  We knew it was a rough winter and we suspected it would be slow this week but we are seeing record low volumes  Of the 20 trading days so far in May  13 have been up and 7 down  The S P has been up 5 of the last 6 with yesterday closing down  0 10 handles 
Our view is the S P is stalling and with so many stops being run on the upside over the last two weeks we really lean to lower prices as we go into the end of the week  That does not mean the S P can t take out yesterday s high or even higher but we want to sell into it 
As always please keep an eye on the 10 handle rule and please use stops when trading futures and options

128706,350221,ANF,Short And Long Opportunities In A Schizophrenic Mark,opinion,Traders are returning to their desks this week with plenty of uncertainty  as equity markets exhibit schizophrenic tendencies  Last week  markets were poised to turn in a disappointing week until a major surge on Friday  The bullish price action came as a result of a better than expected US jobs report   along with a re assessment of Draghi s comments regarding ECB bond purchases  The rally gave bulls the comfort of a significant price advance in a short period of time  but failed to do much to change the overall technical or fundamental picture  Not only are key problems still unsolved in Europe  politicians still have not reached a solution for how to bail out Spain and Italy   but the strong US jobs report actually left a lot to be desired  While the headline number came in above expectations  163 000 jobs created is not even enough to keep up with population growth The unemployment rate ticked higher  to 8 3   even as 150 000 indiviuals  left the workforce  which means they are no longer counted as unemployed One in seven Americans are still either unemployed or underemployed And even if the employment picture was improving  it would actually make it less likely that the Fed will act aggressively at its next meeting The resulting surge in equities was largely propelled by institutional managers chasing performance  along with plenty of short covering as the blue chip averages hit new short term highs  Small caps  via the iShares Russell 2000 Index   IWM  are acting as a canary in the coal mine  trading back to the high end of a descending channel   and facing major overhead resistance  In today s bi polar market environment  we re finding a number of attractive short and long candidates as high beta risk assets are being bid to unsustainable prices  while some deep value and oversold areas still offer compelling reward to risk opportunities from the long side  Some of the biggest and fiercest short term rallies occur during secular bear markets  as volatile sentiment levels and short covering can drive prices sharply higher for a time  Today s market environment favors the nimble trader  as fundamental assumptions continue to be challenged and institutional capital moves swiftly from sector to sector in search of a performance edge  Below are a few of the trading areas we are monitoring this week  Retail Feels the Pain of Slowing Consumer Spending  Retail stocks have held up surprisingly well throughout the last year   this despite high levels of unemployment and even higher levels of underemployment  For retailers catering to low income spenders  a material portion of revenue growth has come because a large segment of the consumer base has migrated from the middle class  to the low income consumer group  This can be seen by the relative difference between middle class retailers like Abercrombie   Fitch  ANF    down 62  from its 2011 high  and discount retailers like Family Dollar Stores  FDO    up 36  over the last 12 months  Retailers catering to the affluent initially held up as well  With unemployment much lower for workers with hefty incomes  spending patterns remained stable  Even affluent spenders who dealt with unemployment still had the ability to spend by tapping into savings or established credit lines  But as the global economic picture has continued to deteriorate  both discount and luxury retailers are dealing with lower levels of spending  Last week Harley Davidson  HOG  CEO Keith Wandell issued some sobering comments in conjunction with his company s disappointing second quarter revenue figures   we re sort of swinging back into being more conservative and trying to figure what s going to happen with the global economy and the election and where our economy is headed   HOG dropped sharply on the day and  while it has recovered somewhat from last week s lows  the stock is well off its highs and in a bearish pattern  The entire retail sector is looking more and more vulnerable as key components issue poor revenue numbers and lower guidance  We ve got our eye on a number of high growth names that have strong potential to disappoint investors  along with a bearish perspective for ETFs representing retailers in general  Energy Stocks Offer Compelling Valuations Whenever a particular group shows up on the front page of a widely circulated publication  it pays to be skeptical  But this week s issue of Barron s has a front page article that actually makes a very   Even with lower crude oil prices  and a nationwide glut of natural gas  stock valuations remain at attractive levels  On top of that  robust dividend payments are attracting capital as investors reach for yield in an era of record low interest rates  Major integrated stocks like Chevron Corporation  CVX  and ExxonMobil  XOM  are likely to attract capital based on low PE ratios and attractive dividend yields  while E P  Exploration   Production  companies like Apache Corp  APA  and Anadarko Petroleum  APC  are attractive based on the magnitude of their oil reserves  Barron s notes that analysts believe many of these companies are trading at exceptional values   even without the benefit of higher commodity prices  With sentiment relatively poor due to the weak price action in crude oil  these names could offer a compelling reward to risk opportunity on the bullish side  Any sustained positive action in crude could continue the fresh uptrend in energy names  Meanwhile  the dividend yields and the valuation of underground reserves can continue to attract capital and offer price support  Emerging Markets Oversold  Underowned They say it s impossible to commit suicide by jumping out of a basement window  The logic may well apply to a number of emerging markets  where equities have pulled back significantly and now trade at cheap valuations  In 2011  the Brazilian economy passed the UK to become the world s 6th largest economy  The country benefits from a wealth of natural resources along with a rapidly growing middle class  Investors have let emerging market equity shares tumble as risk appetite has waned  but that action could be reversed in the coming weeks  Shares of Brazilian equities could be bid up quickly simply as a result of a  risk on  move as portfolio managers pick up beaten down holdings in search of long term value  Economic growth prospects also offer long term potential for price appreciation  in a global environment where robust growth is hard to find  Shares of the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund  EWZ  have found support in the low  50 s and could complete a breakout over the next few sessions   capturing the attention of momentum buyers along with performance chasing institutional buyers   Back in the US  the prospect for corporate earnings growth may be much darker than most Wall Street analysts are willing to admit  John Mauldin offered a  over the weekend  noting the cyclicality of corporate earnings and the probability a major contraction  if not decline  in earnings over the next several years  On top of that  August has typically been one of the most bearish months of the year   with September and October also carrying risk of major volatility   putting us in a very uncertain period for US equities  As evidenced by the Live Feed Trend Tracker  a large number of the markets that we track are in neutral territory   this despite Friday s surge in equities  We continue to find both bullish and bearish opportunities in today s market  focusing primarily on short term swing trades while waiting for more macro clarity before entering longer term trend trades So far this earnings season  we have seen a continued trend towards EPS beats but disappointing revenue numbers  Guidance from management has also largely been negative Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice
