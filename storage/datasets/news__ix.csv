recovery from the recession and buoyed Wall Street 
 Toyota Motor Corp will be in focus after the world s biggest
automaker forecast a slightly shallower annual loss  but slipped
to its third straight quarterly loss as sales sank in Japan 
Europe and the United States 
  The market will get solid support by growing optimism about
the economic recovery and the bottoming out of corporate earnings
prospects   said Hiroichi Nishi  general manager of equity
marketing at Nikko Cordial Securities 
  But profit taking pressure is likely to emerge  keeping the
market within a narrow range  after Japanese stocks scored fresh
highs yesterday and ahead of important U S  economic indicators
such as the jobs data  
 The U S  economy is expected to have lost 320 000 nonfarm
payroll jobs in July  a hefty number but still an improvement
over last month s drop of 467 000  The unemployment rate is
expected to have risen to 9 6 percent  The figures will be
released on Friday 
 Market players said Toyota shares may face profit taking as
immediate trading factors have run their course with its earnings
report out of the way and as the stock had already gained
sharply

 Honda Motor Co will be in focus after it surprised with a
near tripling of its annual profit forecasts that some said may

a dominant motorcycle business and line up heavy in small cars 
 Market watchers said they were keen to see if Honda s
earnings would provide firm support for the market

concern growing that it means a correction for share markets

Mizuho Securities 
  Trade today is likely to be a tug of war between this
concern on the one hand and good factors for individual shares 
such as the Honda results

   Reaction to tankan business sentiment survey mixed
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  July 1  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average slipped 0 2
percent on Wednesday  with Orix Corp and All Nippon Airways
sliding after sources said the firms were set to announce large
public share offerings 
 But construction machinery makers such as Komatsu gained
after China s official purchasing managers  index  PMI  for June
showed the country s economic recovery is on more solid ground 
 Response to the Bank of Japan s quarterly survey of business
confidence was mixed  with some analysts saying it had no impact
on the market  but others  noting lagging capital spending 
saying it was slightly negative 
 The Nikkei had risen around 1 percent at one stage but
quickly shed its gains in the afternoon 
  It seems there was some large lot selling in futures   said
a portfolio manager at a Japanese asset management firm 
 While the reason for such selling was unclear  such moves
may reflect profit taking or hedge selling by institutional
investors  the portfolio manager said 
 The Nikkei fell 18 51 points to 9 939 93  beginning the new
quarter on a negative note 
 In the April June quarter  the benchmark index jumped 23
percent for its best quarterly gain in about 14 years 
 The broader Topix index shed 0 2 percent or 1 46 points to
928 30 on Wednesday 
 The BOJ s tankan corporate survey showed that confidence
among big manufacturers pulled back from a record low hit three
months ago  as exports and output improved from a severe
downturn late last year 
 But it also showed that big firms plan to cut capital
spending  a key driver of the economy  by 9 4 percent in the
financial year to March 2010  against the market s median
forecast for a 6 9 percent fall 
  Basically  the tankan showed that things aren t all that
good in the near term but seemed encouraging for the longer
term  making its overall impact neutral   said Kenichi Hirano 
operating officer at Tachibana Securities 
 PUBLIC OFFERINGS
 Orix fell 4 8 percent to 5 530 yen after three sources said
Japan s biggest leasing firm and a major property investor plans
to raise about 100 billion yen   1 billion  through a public
share offering 
 Five sources said All Nippon Airways  Japan s No  2 airline 
plans to raise more than 150 billion yen   1 6 billion  in a
public share offering  sending its shares tumbling 5 9 percent
to 317 yen 
 ANA said after the close that it would raise up to 182 6
billion yen   1 9 billion  in a public offering to use for
capital spending including new planes  adding that it had raised
its order for Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner airplanes to 55 from 50 
 Whether there will be more public offerings hinges on what
firms think of the economic outlook  said Shoji Hirakawa  chief
strategist of equities research at UBS Securities Japan 
 If companies think the economy will recover  they may feel
the need to raise money for capital spending  he said 
  The impact on the market is positive   Hirakawa said about
the public offerings   They are doing this because the economy
has improved enough or share prices have risen sufficiently to
conduct financing  
 Construction machinery makers rose after the China PMI data 
with Komatsu rising 1 8 percent to 1 519 yen and Hitachi
Construction Machinery gaining 1 6 percent to 1 600 yen 
 Brokerage CLSA s China Purchasing Managers  Index rose in
June to an 11 month high of 51 8 and China s official purchasing
managers  index for June also showed China s economic recovery
is on more solid ground 
  Since Japan exports a lot to China  such data is positive
for Japanese shares   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  a supervisor in
Okasan Securities  investment strategy department 
 Shinsei Bank and Aozora Bank said after the market close
that the two banks would merge at a ratio of 1 1 
 The incoming head of the bank to be formed by the merger 
Norito Ikeda  said the new entity will apply for more public
money if necessary 
 Aozora is majority owned by United States based Cerberus

 TOKYO  Oct 28  Reuters    Monex Group Inc  Japan s No  3
online broker  will buy the securities unit of Orix Corp for
about  246 million in stock  in a deal that will create the
country s second largest online broker 
 By forming a broker with more than 2 1 trillion yen   23
billion  in client assets in over 1 3 million securities
accounts  the two will be able to cut systems and other costs
and beef up product and service line ups  they said in a
statement 
 The move may signal the start of consolidation in Japan s
decade old online brokerage industry after the global economic
crisis poured cold water on a stock trading boom among
individual investors  triggering fierce price competition 
  With the retail investor business shrinking  even online
brokers are now seeking to achieve economies of scale and offer
better services through expensive system upgrades  so that they
can win a larger share of the market   said Katsuhiko Hiroshige 
general manager of equities at Bansei Securities 
 Monex will issue 673 0002 new shares to leasing and real
estate giant Orix  giving it a 22 5 percent stake and making it
the broker s top shareholder ahead of Citigroup  whose ownership
will drop to 20 6 percent from 26 3 percent 
 The deal would be worth 22 5 billion yen based on Monex s
closing stock price of 33 450 yen 
 Retail investors  trading turnover on Japan s three major
exchanges  the Tokyo  Osaka and Nagoya bourses  fell by a third
to 178 trillion yen in 2008  outpacing a 23 percent fall in
trading by all investors 
  Day trading by individuals has calmed down substantially 
because of a slump in new listings  especially for start ups 
since 2006    and also due to the recent market crash and the
economic slowdown   said Yuri Yoshida  an analyst at Standard

6737,228252,IX,UPDATE 2 Japan minister resigns in blow to PM before poll,news,"  Internal affairs minister  PM s ally  quits
   Row hurts ruling party just months from poll   analyst
   Argument over the sale of Japan Post properties
 TOKYO  June 12  Reuters    Japan Internal Affairs Minister
Kunio Hatoyama  a close ally of Prime Minister Taro Aso 
resigned on Friday  in a blow to Aso ahead of a looming
election 
 Hatoyama had insisted that Yoshifumi Nishikawa  president
of Japan Post  should be replaced  though many in the ruling
party have said Nishikawa should stay in his job  creating a
dilemma for Aso in recent weeks 
  It is hard for the public to understand why the row has
become such a big issue   said political commentator Akira
Hayasaka  adding that the internal row within the cabinet gives
a negative impression of Aso s government 
  It will be a minus for his party ahead of the election  
 Hatoyama had said Nishikawa should go because of Japan
Post s attempt to sell its nationwide resort complex to leasing
company Orix Co   the chairman of which helped craft a
government plan to privatise the postal system 
 The move would end the row over the personnel issue  But it
would be a blow to the unpopular prime minister after
opposition parties have criticised Aso for a lack of leadership
in failing to solve the problem quickly 
 Aso s Liberal Democratic Party faces a tough battle in a
general election due by October  with the main opposition
Democratic Party now leading in voter polls 
 An opposition victory would end half a century of almost
unbroken rule by the conservative LDP 
 In a Yomiuri newspaper poll on Monday  39 1 percent of
respondents said they would vote for the Democrats  compared
with 28 7 percent who preferred the LDP 
 Japan Post was broken up into four state owned firms in
2007 as the first step in a 10 year privatisation process
driven by former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 
 Stakes in two of the four units  one for banking and one
for insurance  are to be sold by 2017  But as the ruling party
drifts away from Koizumi s reforms  Aso s government has
suggested aspects of the plan should be reviewed 
 It would not be the first time an Aso ally has had to leave
the cabinet  In February  then finance minister Shoichi
Nakagawa resigned after being forced to deny he was drunk at a
G7 news conference 
 Support for Aso  Japan s third prime minister in less than
two years  fell below 30 percent in a poll by public
broadcaster NHK this week after he flip flopped on policy and
rowed publicly with Hatoyama  even as the economy struggles
with its deepest recession in decades

 The failure of SFCG with debts of  3 6 billion    Japan s
biggest bankruptcy filing in debt terms this year    would
likely ripple through the stock market as it would make
financing even more difficult for small and medium firms  an
analyst said 
  SFCG s failure might become the first stage of a second
round of the financial crisis   said Norihito Fujito  general
manager at the investment research and information division of
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities 
 Japanese firms are slashing jobs to survive as the economy
looks set for its longest recession in modern times  A record 33
listed companies went under in Japan last year  most of them
crippled as banks tightened their lending policies 
 The collapse of SFCG  whose creditors include Citibank  may
point to a higher default risk among second tier non banks as
they face difficulties collecting loans from real estate and
smaller firms  said Daiwa SMBC credit analyst Takao Matsuzaka 
 Shares in consumer finance firm Aiful Corp led the decline 
sliding 20 3 percent to the lowest level since the issue was
listed in 1997  Rival Takefuji Corp tumbled 15 2 percent  and
the subindex of Japanese non bank lenders plunged to the lowest
in more than two decades 
 Among real estate firms  Daikyo Inc lost 12 percent 
 Tokyo based SFCG  whose creditors also include
HypoVereinsbank  said it had an outstanding loan balance of
547 8 billion yen on a group basis as of October last year 
 Shinsei Trust   Banking Co  a unit of Shinsei Bank Ltd  said
in a statement that while it held securitised loans of SFCG on
behalf of investors  it did not have any direct exposure  Orix
Trust and Banking  which was also listed as a creditor in a
filing  issued a similar statement 
 MORE PROBLEMS AHEAD 
 In seeking court protection from creditors under bankruptcy
law  SFCG said it had outstanding commercial paper of just 1 5
billion yen   16 million  
 The lender  which had borrowed heavily from foreign banks
including Lehman Brothers  suffered from unrecoverable losses
from property backed loans to small and mid sized companies 
 It has also been slammed by tighter interest rate
regulations in the consumer lender industry  forcing it to repay
previous interest that had been ruled to be too high 
 SFCG  which started business in 1978  generated about 80
percent of sales from the third party guaranteed  Shohkoh loan 
and 8 percent from property backed loans 
 SFCG filed for court protection under bankruptcy law with
338 billion yen   3 6 billion  in debt  saying it had not been
able to cope with mounting losses in its mainstay secured loans
businesses thanks to rising bankruptcies  sinking property
prices and weak demand for new loans 
 The lender  which posted a group net profit of 6 85 billion
yen in the year ended July last year  said it failed to secure
7 5 billion yen needed for its February settlement 
  The move shows that there is extremely severe credit
tightening happening in Japan   Fujito said 
  We ll need to watch small REIT and real estate companies 
businesses as many of them are SFCG borrowers  The business
outlook for non bank firms is also a concern  
 SFCG is the 10th listed Japanese company to fail this year 
 On Monday  seven other non listed companies including a
restaurant operator Kanda Seiyoken  stopped operations prior to
bankruptcy filings  research firm Teikoku Databank said 
 Shares in SFCG  which will be delisted on March 24  were
untraded with a glut of sellers at 1 092 yen  down 200 yen or
15 5 percent 
 The Nikkei average fell 0 6 percent  erasing early losses
after a media report that the U S  government may end up owning
as much as 40 percent of major U S  bank Citigroup  while money
markets were also unaffected by SFCG 
  The money market is calm today and I do not get the sense
that there is any impact   said an official at a Japanese money
broker 
  The amount of commercial paper is also very small  so I
think it is safe to think that there will be no impact on the
market

   Gains in Asian shares  yen s weakness lend support
   Some talk of buying by retail investors  overseas players
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  July 1  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei average rose 1
percent on Wednesday  helped by firmness in other Asian equity
markets  with construction makers such as Komatsu climbing on
data showing a continued recovery in China 
 But shares in Orix Corp and All Nippon Airways slid after
sources familiar with the matter said they were set to announce
large public share offerings 
 Tokyo shares extended their gains in the afternoon amid some
talk of buying by overseas investors at the start of the year s
second half  as well as short covering by retail investors 
 The yen s fall against the dollar and the euro also lent
support  with exporters such as Nissan Motor edging higher 
 The firmness in Tokyo shares over the past couple of days has
been a bit of a surprise  said Hiroaki Osakabe  fund manager at
Chibagin Asset Management 
  Part of it may be that it is hard to go short ahead of
economic data  especially since most indicators have been showing
improvement   Osakabe said  adding that a focal point later in
the day would be the U S  Institute for Supply Management s index
of national factory activity 
 Brokerage CLSA s China Purchasing Managers  Index rose in
June to an 11 month high of 51 8 and China s official purchasing
managers  index  PMI  for June also showed China s economic
recovery is on more solid ground 
  Since Japan exports a lot to China  such data is positive
for Japanese shares   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  supervisor for
Okasan Securities  investment strategy department 
 The Nikkei rose 102 64 points to 10 061 08 on the first day
of a new quarter  adding to the hefty gains made in April June 
when it jumped 23 percent for its best quarterly gain in about 14
years 
  The broader Topix rose 0 8 percent to 937 58 
 One equities trader cited talk that overseas investors were
buying Tokyo shares at the start of the year s second half 
adding that overseas pension funds may be behind the moves 
 Orix Corp fell 3 4 percent to 5 610 yen after three sources
said Japan s biggest leasing firm and a major property investor
plans to raise about 100 billion yen   1 billion  through a

more than 150 billion yen   1 6 billion  in a public share

6756,228271,IX,UPDATE 2 Orix requests probe  says finances are fine,news," Updates with details  background 
 TOKYO  Dec 5  Reuters    Japanese leasing and financial
services firm Orix Corp said it has asked the securities watchdog
to investigate  false information  being spread by an investor
and hurting its stock price 
 Orix  Japan s biggest leasing company and an active investor
in the property market  also said that it had secured a
commitment line of 100 billion yen   1 1 billion  from 30
financial institutions and stressed that its finances were sound 
 Orix said it submitted its request to Japan s Securities and
Exchange Surveillance Commission  SESC  on Friday 
 Shares of Orix were up 2 5 percent at 4 590 yen as of 0351
GMT  outperforming a 0 9 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei
average 
  Orix has heard from three separate sources that an investor
has been spreading false information   said Orix investor
relations official Greg Melchior  declining to elaborate on the
nature of the information being circulated 
 The move comes about two weeks after Orix announced that it
would issue 150 billion yen worth of convertible bonds  the most
by a Japanese company in two years  to help it pay down
short term debt and raise funds for investments 
 Shares of Orix have lost about half of their value since
mid November when media reports of the convertible bond issue
surfaced  triggering worries among investors that their stakes
would be diluted when the bonds are converted to shares 
 Last month Orix cut its net profit forecast for the year to
March by 40 percent to 105 billion yen as the tumble in global
stock markets hit its investment portfolio and a weakening
economy forced it to boost provisions against loans 
 Investors have also been concerned about Orix s exposure to
Japan s ailing property sector  Hundreds of midsize developers
and builders have failed this year due to slumping demand for
apartments and tighter credit conditions 
 Orix has recently invested about 10 billion yen each into
struggling property developer Joint Corp and condominium builder

 Kabu com Securities market analyst Tsutomu Yamada said there
has recently been speculation in the market about Orix s
financial health 
  Their exposure to the real estate market is huge  and market
players were wondering how Orix was planning to improve its

 By Mariko Katsumura and Taiga Uranaka
 TOKYO  Dec 5  Reuters    Japanese leasing and financial
services firm Orix Corp said it has asked the nation s securities
watchdog to investigate  false information  being spread by an
investor  as its shares tumbled briefly to a 12 year low 
 Orix  Japan s biggest leasing company and an active investor
in the property market  also said it had secured a commitment
line of 100 billion yen   1 1 billion  from 30 financial
institutions and stressed that its finances were sound 
 It submitted its request to Japan s Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission  SESC  on Friday 
 Orix has heard from three separate sources that an investor
has been spreading false information   said Orix investor
relations official Greg Melchior  declining to elaborate on the
nature of the information being circulated 
 The move comes about two weeks after Orix announced that it
would issue 150 billion yen worth of convertible bonds  the most
by a Japanese company in two years  to help it pay down
short term debt and raise funds for investments 
 Orix shares earlier sank as low as 3 980 yen  their lowest
since January 1997  before recovering to close up 0 5 percent at
4 500 yen  compared to a 0 1 percent fall in Tokyo s benchmark
Nikkei average 
 Shares of Orix have lost about half of their value since
mid November when media reports of the convertible bond issue
surfaced  triggering worries among investors that their stakes
would be diluted when the bonds are converted to shares 
 Last month Orix cut its net profit forecast for the year to

 Investors have also been concerned about Orix s exposure to

 Orix recently invested about 10 billion yen into both
struggling property developer Joint Corp and condominium builder
Daikyo Inc 
 Kabu com Securities market analyst Tsutomu Yamada said there
has recently been speculation in the market about Orix s
financial health 
  Their exposure to the real estate market is huge  and market
players were wondering how Orix was planning to improve its
business given today s sluggish property market   he said 
  Check out their CDS  credit default swaps    they re
soaring  That suggests investors are doubtful about the company s
financial condition   said Yamada 
 Orix s 5 year CDS spreads were last traded at around 370
basis points in October and the latest bid is indicated at 1 200
basis points  according to Reuters data 
 CDS is a financial product which bond investors purchase to
protect themselves against defaults 
 Orix said in a statement that there were no concerns over its
 present liquidity and funding  
 Shinko Securities  senior credit analyst Naoko Yamauchi also
said there was little reason to worry about Orix s health 
  The company s latest disclosed documents show Orix faces no
bond redemptions before the year end  holds about 300 billion yen
in cash as of end September and has lots of commitment lines with
banks   said Yamauchi 
  It s obvious to any clear thinker that the financial
situation of the company is fine   Yamauchi said

sliding after sources said the firms were set to announce large
public share offerings 
 But construction machinery makers such as Komatsu gained
after China s official purchasing managers  index  PMI  for June

 Response to the Bank of Japan s quarterly survey of business
confidence was mixed  with some analysts saying it had no impact
on the market  but others  noting lagging capital spending 
saying it was slightly negative 
 The Nikkei had risen around 1 percent at one stage but
quickly shed its gains in the afternoon 
  It seems there was some large lot selling in futures   said
a portfolio manager at a Japanese asset management firm 
 While the reason for such selling was unclear  such moves may
reflect profit taking or hedge selling by institutional
investors  the portfolio manager said 
 The Nikkei fell 18 51 points to 9 939 93  beginning the new
quarter on a negative note 
 In the April June quarter  the benchmark index jumped 23
percent for its best quarterly gain in about 14 years 
 The broader Topix index shed 0 2 percent or 1 46 points to
928 30 
 The BOJ s tankan corporate survey showed that confidence
among big manufacturers pulled back from a record low hit three
months ago  as exports and output improved from a severe downturn
late last year 
 But it also showed that big firms plan to cut capital
spending  a key driver of the economy  by 9 4 percent in the
financial year to March 2010  against the market s median
forecast for a 6 9 percent fall 
  Basically  the tankan showed that things aren t all that
good in the near term but seemed encouraging for the longer term 
making its overall impact neutral   said Kenichi Hirano 
operating officer at Tachibana Securities 
 Orix fell 4 8 percent to 5 530 yen after three sources said
Japan s biggest leasing firm and a major property investor plans
to raise about 100 billion yen   1 billion  through a public

 ANA said after the close that it would raise up to 182 6

capital spending including new planes 
 Construction machinery makers rose after the China PMI data

 Brokerage CLSA s China Purchasing Managers  Index rose in

for Japanese shares   said Hideyuki Ishiguro  supervisor for

 Shinsei Bank and Aozora Bank said after the market close that
the two banks would merge at a ratio of 1 1

 TOKYO  May 11  Reuters    Japan s Nikkei rose on Wednesday 
boosted by gains in companies that provided positive outlooks
for the current business year such as Orix Corp and NEC
Corp   while investors largely shrugged off slightly
stronger than expected inflation data from China 	
 The market was also bolstered by resilient commodity shares 
which held on to early gains despite a brief drop in brent crude
prices after output and loan data from the world s
second largest economy hinted at slowing demand 	
 China s headline consumer price inflation slowed to 5 3
percent in the year to April from 5 4 percent in March  the
National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday  although that
was still higher than expected   ID nL3E7GB06W 	
  Tokyo shares didn t react badly after the data  but worries
over further cooling in China  which is a huge market for many
Nikkei listed firms  will likely keep a lid on further gains  
said Norihiro Fujito  senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities 	
  The Nikkei may be heading for a correction towards the end
of May  which is when hedge funds reshuffle their portfolios
after mid year earnings reports  and if we see further unwinding
in commodities markets   Fujito said  adding that the Nikkei may
temporarily dip below 9 500 	
 Despite gains in the Nikkei  trading was subdued with
investors cautious ahead of Toyota Motor Corp s 
full year earnings release after the closing bell 	
 Market analysts said some investors may try chasing the
market higher to 10 000 points but profit taking by life
insurers is likely to kick in if and when it touches that level 	
  The mood is not too bad after corporate earnings results 
But with a lot of companies deciding not to release full year
forecasts  there isn t much to justify further gains   said
Hideyuki Okoshi  general manager at Chibagin Securities 	
 He said the Nikkei may try to reach key psychological
resistance at 10 000 but it may not be able to stay there unless
there are favourable indications on how companies performed in
the first quarter 	
 Another trader at a Japanese brokerage said that
while foreigners have bought Japanese stocks below 10 000  sell
orders are seen above that level 	
 By mid afternoon the benchmark Nikkei average
 had risen 0 4 percent to 9 862 06  while the broader
Topix gained 0 2 percent to 858 41 	
 The Nikkei hovered above its 200 day moving average  now at
9 823  which has become an immediate support level 	
 Volume was moderate  with 928 million shares
changing hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange s main board by the
midday break  It was poised to post daily volume around
Tuesday s 1 90 billion shares 	
 
 GOLD UP	
 Japanese shares have dropped about 5 percent since the March
11 quake  while Asian stocks outside Japan have
gained about 8 percent in the last two months 	
 Analysts added that while both the Nikkei s 25 day and
200 day moving averages are gradually rising  suggesting an
upward trend in the market  investors remain cautious about
chasing the index higher 	
  Foreigners are buying  but they are still looking for
fundamental reasons to invest in Japan   said Hiroichi Nishi 
general manager at SMBC Nikko Securities 	
 Foreigners have been net buyers of Japanese stocks for the
past 26 weeks  according to data released by the TSE  encouraged
by strength in overseas equities 	
 Commodity shares such as oil stocks and mining shares
outperformed on rising oil and gold prices 	
 Inpex added 0 9 percent to 583 000 yen and Japan
Petroleum Exploration rose 1 6 percent to 3 930 yen 	
 Japanese truckmaker Isuzu Motors gained 4 3 percent
to 364 yen on news that it and Volkswagen AG  are
considering an operational tie up in areas such as truck
engines  They have no immediate plans for capital ties  a top
Isuzu executive said   ID nLDE7491T6 	
 Shares in NEC Corp soared 5 9 percent to 179 yen after the
firm forecast a 56 percent rise in operating profit to 90
billion yen in the business year to March 2012  beating an
average estimate of 69 7 billion yen from six analysts who had
updated their forecasts in the last 30 days  according to
Thomson Reuters I B E S 	
 Orix Corp gained 3 9 percent to 8 010 yen in active trade
after the company forecast its net profit for the current
business year to March 2012 will rise 15 percent to 77 5 billion
yen   959 million  	
 That was slightly lower than the 81 billion yen predicted by
the Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate  which places more
weight on recent forecasts by top ranked analysts  although the
majority of them did not update their estimates after the March
11 earthquake

6784,228299,IX,Buy These ETFs As BlackRock Cuts Fees,opinion,"One of the leading asset management companies  BlackRock Inc    NYSE BLK   recently entered into the battle of fee cuts after slashing expense fees for some of its iShares Core ETFs  It is speculated that the company took the step to provide tough competition to other potential players in the domain such as Vanguard  Schwab and Fidelity who were among the first to cut fees for their funds  This move is likely to attract more money into the ETF business  which is already expanding at an impressive pace   Read   
BlackRock Slashes Fees 
Expense fees for 15 BlackRock s iShares Core ETFs were reduced within the range of 2 5 bps in order to make it more competitive compared to its peers  BlackRock management said that it has opted for the cuts on the back of a new set of rules under the Department of Labor s  fiduciary standard   which asked advisors to give precedence to their client s interest over their owns  Meanwhile  the fees cuts made these ETFs one of the cheapest options within their domain 
For an instance  the company reduced fees for its S P 500 tracking ETF  iShares Core S P 500  from 0 07  to 0 04   The fee cut made IVV less expensive than other popular ETFs in its domain  The other two popular ETFs that also seek to replicate the S P 500 s performance   SPDR S P 500 ETF   AX SPY   and Vanguard 500 ETF    currently charge expense fees of 0 09  and 0 05   respectively  lower than that of IVV 
Fee Cut to Capture Market Share 
Though management cited the Labor Department s new set of rules as the main reason behind the reduction in fees  some analysts believe that the company slashed fees to occupy higher market share than its potential competitors  This seems to be true in the current scenario when investors appear to be more interested in allocating their assets to low expense funds compared to those with higher expenses  read    
The global director of Morningstar s ETF Research  Ben Johnson said   These fee cuts may actually move the needle more for fund sponsors  who stand to win market share  than they might for investors  who may or may not be able to save a few bucks on fees   He also added   Lower fees are unequivocally good for investors  That said  the incremental savings are often de minimis at this point  
Here are the 15 ETFs that witnessed fees cuts
