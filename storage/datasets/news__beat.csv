     Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the earnings release Factors to ConsiderFirst quarter revenue growth is expected to be driven by strength in the Healthcare Services business  which has been consistently driving the top line for quite some time In fact  for the first quarter of 2019  management expects revenues within  102  105 million  Moreover  EBITDA return is projected at 28  Management is optimistic about contributions from the new MCT  mobile cardiac telemetry  and extended Ware Holter products to the quarterly results  Interestingly  these products have been seeing rising patient volumes along with a favorable payor mix Management is also optimistic about the LifeWatch acquisition  which has proven accretive already and is anticipated to contribute to the results in the soon to be reported quarter We expect these developments to continue boosting the top line in the first quarter of 2019 However  it must be noted that BioTelemetry receives reimbursements for products from commercial payors  Hence  changes in reimbursement rates can materially impact revenues and hence the overall operating results of the company Here s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts According to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   You can see  BioTelemetry has a Zacks Rank  1 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   a combination that does not suggest an earnings beat in the quarter to be reported Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post a beat this earnings season Cardinal Health   NYSE CAH    with an Earnings ESP of  1 13  and a Zacks Rank  3 Stryker Corporation   NYSE SYK    with an Earnings ESP of  0 63  and a Zacks Rank  3 Medidata Solutions   NASDAQ MDSO    with an Earnings ESP of  12 31  and a Zacks Rank  3 Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity  Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices  In the process  it s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate  12 3 trillion in activity A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech  Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  in the 1990s  Zacks  just released special report reveals 7 stocks to watch  The report is only available for a limited time ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/biotelemetry-beat-to-report-q1-earnings-whats-in-store-200409764,200409764
25613,247128,BEAT,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  InTest  Progressive  BioTelemetry  Bausch Health And Steelcase,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 7  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  inTest Corp    NYSE INTT    The Progressive Corp    NYSE PGR    BioTelemetry   NASDAQ BEAT    Bausch Health Cos   NYSE BHC   and Steelcase   NYSE SCS   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Bull or Bear  Your Investment Strategy for 2019The longest bull market in history has taken both experts and novices by surprise  So every now and then  there is this conversation about the possibilities of a recession and what we should do to prepare for it  There have been many such conversations through 2018  but a recession never materialized  as the market and the government appear to have gotten smarter at aversion  Or at least at ensuring that earlier indicators won t be valid this time around Take the lead indicator yield curve inversion for example  In an expanding economy  government bond yields surpass short term yields because of greater optimism about the future  When short term yields exceed long term yields  the inversion is an indication of uncertainty about the future But monetary policy has effectively kept long term rates low so bond yields remain attractive and spending by both the government and corporations can continue  Still  the gap between 10 year and 2 year yields continues to narrow  indicating that a bear market may be in the offing Another indicator is a pickup in M A activity  which is a typical occurrence toward the end of the business cycle  But M A has been robust in the last few years with no signs of a bear market  The last year has seen a fresh spate of activity  but since companies aren t in distress  this may or may not be a valid signal The story appears even more positive if you consider the high yield spread  which is the difference between the yields in below investment grade corporate debt and  risk free  U S  Treasuries  When the economy is strong  the gap spread is typically smaller as the risk of doing business is relatively low As recession fears near  however  opportunities shrink and it becomes harder to do business  As a result  companies need to pay more for significantly riskier ventures  The high yield spread has risen during the last two recessions  but as the chart below shows  it remains at acceptable levels right now An increase in weekly jobless claims  first time claims for state unemployment benefits  is another strong and obvious indicator of a recession  But while jobless claims increased in the last week of the year  it makes sense to study the trend rather than what happened in a single week And despite the usual ups and downs  weekly jobless claims continue to trend down steadily since the last recession  Other than the record low unemployment rate  lower taxes and lower oil prices continue to support consumer liquidity   Persistently declining stock or index valuations can also indicate a broader market slowdown  The following table shows sector valuations for the historical period wherein downward pressure across sectors is apparent  But significant declines  of 20  or more  are seen in less than half the sectors Moreover  the bigger sectors  medical  technology  finance  are holding up better  indicating some positive sentiment around growth  Oil Energy and Transport sectors are borderline cases As detailed in the current   total Q4 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up 11 8  from the year ago quarter on revenues that are expected to be up 5 6   This however is down from  15 9  growth expected at the start of the quarter and further declines can t be ruled out The negative revisions trend is widespread  with estimates for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down during the quarter  The Conglomerates  Construction  Energy and Consumer Discretionary sectors have seen the biggest downward revisions while Transportation continued to benefit from lower oil prices Investment Strategy for 2019The mixed signals in the above message means that while we don t need to bail out of the market right away  or at all   a defensive strategy may be the best way to go The first leg of that strategy is a focus on Zacks Rank  1 stocks  since the rank has historically outperformed the market by a wide margin At the onset of a recession  it is better to get into defensive sectors  but as evident from the above  it is the growth sectors that are holding up relatively better in the current environment So finding stocks like inTest Corp  in the Technology sector that offer growth at attractive valuations may be a good idea Finance is another area with plenty of opportunities  So stocks like The Progressive Corp  are worth buying Growth opportunities abound in the medical sector  but BioTelemetry stand out  A value pick like Bausch Health Cos is also worth considering Utilities and Business Services are good defensive sectors but there are fewer opportunities  So Steelcase is one of the only ones catching the eye ConclusionThe bears may not have taken over yet  but there are strong enough signs that they may not be too far away  So the strong economic growth  healthy labor market  low inflation and interest rates  and GDP growth that are the hallmarks of a bull market may gradually give way  Let s hope for the best and prepare for the worst The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through

25614,247129,BEAT,January Marks A Good Start For Wall Street  5 Picks ,opinion,"Historical data shows that this January will do better than normal  While stock investors are  no doubt  counting on the  January effect   this January comes in the third year of presidential election cycles  which also bodes well for equities 
Stellar jobs report  dovish commentary by the Fed Chair and thawing of Sino U S  trade tensions are some of the developments that are making traders all the more upbeat on the New York Stock Exchange  Given the positives  investing in stocks that can make the most of the encouraging trend seems judicious 
Third Year of Presidential Election Cycles
January has mostly been a strong month for stocks  Major bourses did gain in the last two successive trading sessions that erased the worst start to a year since 2000  Some analysts say that this January  in particular  is the best month for stocks because it comes in the third year of the presidential election cycle 
Since 1950  the broader S P 500 has registered its best gains in January during pre election years  posting an average gain of 3 9  for the month  per Dow Jones Market Data  Meanwhile  the S P 500 s average gain for all the other Januarys since 1950 is 1   data indicated  The ruling party s typical initiative to implement new policies or aim for lower taxes ahead of a presidential election in an effort to propel the U S  economy is cited to be one of the reasons for such gains 

 
 Source  Dow Jones Market Data 
January Effect
The recent two days surge also lends hope to the idea that a  January effect  may be taking place  It is a seasonal increase in stock prices during the month of January  which mostly follows a drop in share prices in December 
Income tax sensitive investors generally sell underperforming stocks at the end of the year in order to claim a capital loss  which is tax deductible  And then such investors reinvest in a New Year 
For example  let s assume an investor earned  15 000 from the sale of ABC stock  Now  the investor needs to pay a capital gain tax of 20   or  3 000  to the government  However  let s say the investor sells XYZ stock for a loss of  7 000  then the net capital gain for tax purpose will be  15 000    7 000    8 000  This means the investor now needs to pay only  1 600 in capital gains tax 
Blockbuster Jobs Report Makes a Mockery of Recession Fears
Signs of a strong U S  labor market  by the way  weakened recession concerns  The U S  economy added 312 000 new jobs in December  the highest hiring in 10 months  This also marked the second highest number of job additions in any month of the Trump administration 

 
 Source  Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Employers added 2 6 million jobs in 2018  more than 2 2 million added in 2017  Hiring in October and November were also way more than reported earlier  with 58 000 new jobs added to the 2018 total  Such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor and headwinds associated with slowdown in cyclical part of the economy  including housing 
The jobless rate  in the meantime  continues to languish at historically low levels  while the hourly pay went up 0 4  to  27 48 last month  In the last 12 months  wages rose to 3 2  from 3 1   matching a post recession high set earlier in the year 
A Dovish Fed  Easing Trade Tensions
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s dovish commentary is equally responsible for powering a rally  while easing trade tension between the United States and China could boost gains further 
Powell did mention that the Fed could be patient when it comes to future interest hikes  He acknowledged that inflation remained muted and  thus  the central bank is in no hurry to hike rates  This is the first time that Powell has used the word patient  something that former Fed Chair Janet Yellen used numerous times 
The United States and China  in the meanwhile  hold crucial talks in Beijing to ease a bitter trade war between two of the world s most powerful economies  Both the countries have been involved in a trade spat since the beginning of 2018  increasing import tariffs on more than  300 billion of each other s commodities

25769,247284,BEAT,BioTelemetry  Ultra Clean  NVIDIA And AMD Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 16  2018    BioTelemetry   NASDAQ BEAT   as the Bull of the Day  Ultra Clean Holdings   NASDAQ UCTT   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   and AMD   NASDAQ AMD   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks  BioTelemetry is a  2 billion maker of cardiac monitoring devices and services that just delivered an earnings report true to its name with a 65  positive surprise on the bottom line On October 30  BEAT reported third quarter adjusted EPS of  0 53 vs  consensus estimates of  0 32 and sales of  100 million vs  the expectation of  98 million  The company also raised Q4 guidance and this inspired analysts to lift their estimates going forward  pushing BEAT shares into the top tier of the Zacks Rank  What Does BEAT Do BioTelemetry provides ambulatory outpatient management solutions for monitoring clinical information regarding an individual s health  It is focused on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias and other heart rhythm disorders using wireless and mobile technologies BEAT technology and systems  including mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry  MCOT   can give medical caregivers and patients remote information as well as historical data Estimates Jump for a Record YearAfter BioTelemetry s Q3 report  investment bank analysts at Raymond James commented that  three straight quarters of accelerating organic revenue growth   18  in 3Q  and 500bp of EBITDA margin expansion  made them  increasingly confident in management s ability to execute  Full year 2018 revenue estimates have now climbed to  397 million  representing 38 4  growth  Next year s top line stands currently at  437 million  for 10  growth And on the profit line  2018 EPS estimates were boosted 14  from  1 51 to  1 72  representing a 77  advance this year Next year s profit projections also rose to  1 72 which is flat year over year  But I suspect analysts are waiting until Q4 results before detailing their models  Ultra Clean Holdings is a  350 million developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment  flat panel  solar and medical device industries Ultra Clean offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for gas delivery systems and other subassemblies  improved design to delivery cycle times  component neutral design and manufacturing and component testing capabilities  The company is headquartered in Menlo Park  California I last wrote about Ultra Clean as the Bear of the Day on August 8 when shares were trading near  15  The stock has been smacked down by over 35  since then  especially since its earnings report last week   Here s what I said in my August report   Ultra Clean has crossed the  1 billion revenue threshold this year  which certainly makes it a strong value on a price to sales ratio basis But earnings estimates have dropped significantly since the company reported their Q2 on July 26 and that s why the stock is in the cellar of the Zacks Rank In the past 30 days  this year s consensus EPS projection has fallen 16  from  2 30 to  1 93  Next year s profit forecast also dropped buy only 11  to  2 38 The analyst downward revisions were inspired by management commentary and guidance about the second half outlook  One of the company s top customers is Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  who also reported on July 26 and indicated on its earnings call that it expects September to be its trough quarter for the year in a transitory weak patch in the semi equipment cycle But while Lam has only gone up since earnings  the pessimism lingers for UCTT  Stifel Nicolaus analysts lowered their price target to  26  from  30  while keeping a Buy rating on the stock  citing that most of the bad news is now priced in  end of my August 8 report excerpts Since then  Ultra Clean has continued to disappoint in the midst of a predominantly bearish cycle for the Semiconductor sector Clearly the Stifel analysts were still too optimistic on the current Semi Cycle  as I have often been   We will both get our comeuppance today as NVIDIA shares make their own new 52 week lows on a big revenue guidance miss Back to UCTT  last week the company reported mixed results and the stock sank to new 52 week lows as earnings continue to collapse  even in the face of solid sales growth  I hope it s clear for you to see that until the earnings estimates stop going down  and start heading back up  it may be best to  stand clean  of Ultra Clean Additional content NVIDIA Crashes 16  After Q3 Miss  Lowered Guidance Shares of A I  chip giant NVIDIA have fallen in a 16 5  crater in late trading today following the company s Q3 earnings report that missed expectations on both top and bottom lines  as well as disappointing guidance looking ahead  Earnings of  1 84 per share missed the Zacks consensus by 3 66  while revenues underperformed by 1 79  in the quarter to  3 18 billion  Shares are now trading at 52 week lows After two years of stellar growth in its Gaming and Data Center segments  we re seeing a leveling off for NVIDIA  and expectations have suddenly come down dramatically  The company itself cites  excess channel inventory  related to the  post crypto currency boom  which will be corrected   Thus  revenue guidance for its fiscal Q4 in January has been ratcheted way down to  2 7 billion from the  3 4 billion analysts had been expecting No doubt analysts will be busy re working their models  with lower price targets and estimates going forward  NVIDIA  which had been a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  rated company ahead of the earnings release  will likely be taken down a peg or two in the near term  Not only that  but investors who have remained tech heavy may see these NVIDIA results lead the sector down in Friday s pre market activity as well NVIDIA still possesses a state of the art platform with its Turing products  which will keep the company viable over the longer term  but hits to its high growth segments    and now with companies like AMD announcing they intend to challenge NVIDIA s preeminence in the Data Center space    are taking this recently high flying Tech favorite down  For more on NVDA s earnings  click here Wall Street s Next

25771,247286,BEAT,Teladoc  TDOC  Surges 64  In A Year  Can The Rally Continue ,opinion,"Teladoc  Inc    NYSE TDOC   has been in investors  good books  courtesy of a strong and growing business in the telehealth industry that is rapidly expanding Despite incurring net loss over the past several years  investors are impressed with this telehealth company s revenue CAGR of 82  during the 2013 2017 period  Notably  the company s net loss can be primarily attributed to high expenses on marketing and business development  which are expected to pay off soon The stock also seemed to have gained from the company s 2018 guidance  which expects a positive adjusted EBITDA between  12 million and  14 million  In the third quarter of 2018  the company delivered a positive adjusted EBITDA of  6 3 million versus an adjusted EBITDA loss of  0 6 million a year ago Notably  visits and membership growth were key revenue drivers  reflecting an increased adoption and utilization of telehealth services 
Additionally  Teladoc s acquisitions of Advance Medical  Best Doctors and HealthiestYou fortified its distribution capabilities and broadened its service offerings The company s organic and inorganic measures are also impressive  which led to business expansion  In a year s time  shares of Teladoc have soared 64  compared with the  s 33  rally 

We have a conviction that the stock should be driven higher going forward 
Key Catalysts
Teladoc has announced to form a virtual care service called Teladoc Global Care for expanding its coverage beyond borders in more than 20 languages  This  in turn  will increase the availability of doctors across the globe  The new platform is likely to boost the company s business  which is currently confined to the United States 
Furthermore  the recent regulatory development from CMS regarding the ability of Medicare advantage plans to include telehealth as part of Teladoc s bids for the 2020 plan year bodes well for the company s long term growth 
This implies that CMS  proposed rules would enable Teladoc to offer all 21 million Medicare advantage enrollees its full suite of services  CMS also underlines the benefits to access cost  convenience and quality that telehealth services provide in its proposals 
Teladoc carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A few better ranked stocks in the same space are BioTelemetry  Inc    NASDAQ BEAT    Medpace Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ MEDP   and AMN Healthcare Servcies Inc    NYSE AMN    While BioTelemetry sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the other two companies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
You can see  
BioTelemetry surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four reported quarters  the average being 55 6  
Medpace and AMN Healthcare outpaced estimates in three of the four reported quarters  the average beat being 22 8  and 4 17   respectively

25772,247287,BEAT,Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day BioTelemetry  Papa John s  Twitter And NRG Energy,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   December 12  2018    BioTelemetry   NASDAQ BEAT   as the Bull of the Day  Papa John s   NASDAQ PZZA   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and NRG Energy   NYSE NRG   
Here is a synopsis of all four stocks 
 
BioTelemetryis a  2 2 billion maker of cardiac monitoring devices and services that became a Zacks  1 Rank Strong Buy on November 1 after delivering an earnings report true to its name with a 65  positive surprise on the bottom line 
 I chose BEAT as the Bull of the Day on Nov 15 when shares were trading below  62  Here s what I said then   
 On October 30  BEAT reported third quarter adjusted EPS of  0 53 vs  consensus estimates of  0 32 and sales of  100 million vs  the expectation of  98 million  
 The company also raised Q4 guidance and this inspired analysts to lift their estimates going forward  pushing BEAT shares into the top tier of the Zacks Rank  
 What Does BEAT Do 
 BioTelemetry provides ambulatory outpatient management solutions for monitoring clinical information regarding an individual s health  It is focused on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias and other heart rhythm disorders using wireless and mobile technologies 
 BEAT technology and systems  including mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry  MCOT   can give medical caregivers and patients remote information as well as historical data 
 Estimates Jump for a Record Year
 After BioTelemetry s Q3 report  investment bank analysts at Raymond James commented that  three straight quarters of accelerating organic revenue growth   18  in 3Q  and 500bp of EBITDA margin expansion  made them  increasingly confident in management s ability to execute  
 Full year 2018 revenue estimates have now climbed to  397 million  representing 38 4  growth  Next year s top line stands currently at  437 million  for 10  growth 
 And on the profit line  2018 EPS estimates were boosted 14  from  1 51 to  1 72  representing a 77  advance this year 
 Next year s profit projections also rose to  1 72 which is flat year over year  But I suspect analysts are waiting until Q4 results before detailing their models 
  end of excerpt from my Nov 15 report 
 Since then  full year 2018 EPS estimates have climbed further to  1 81 and next year s look is now for  1 78 
 Revenue projections have also moved up with this year s consensus now at  399 million and 2019 still pushing 10  growth at  439 million 
 What Else Is New 
 How about a price target bump from SunTrust analysts to  80 from  67  On Nov 29  the bank s med tech team updated their long run sales estimates for BioTelemetry citing 9 2  top line growth over the period 2018 2021  Embedded in this view is the projection that mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry  MCOT     which is over 60  of sales    grows at an estimated 9   roughly in line with the market  BEAT has about 60  share of that market 
 BEAT also has a growing Research segment that is able to use data from its devices and services  And its acquisition last year of the Switzerland based LifeWatch expanded its reach in Europe 
 And SunTrust believes that  BEAT s very capable management team will articulate an interesting digital population health strategy sometime in 2019  
 But there s an elephant in the room we haven t discussed yet  Here s what I wrote last month     
 Will Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Leave Medical to BEAT 
 BEAT shares took off this year after inking a deal with Apple to conduct a joint Heart Study  The new Apple Watch Series 4  which received FDA clearance as a Class II device  has the potential to expand the cardiac monitoring market 
 So while Apple may not be interested in BEAT technology  the brand and research pedigree has clearly benefited BEAT growth and interest  
 But this also raises concerns that a move by Apple into BEAT s territory could be fatal if the giant iPhone maker is pursuing  medical grade  applications for the Watch or some other device 
 Right now  it appears that Apple is not treading on BEAT s turf  And optimism remains among analysts that the services growth trajectory of the big fruit will only continue to benefit the addressable market for the little heart watcher 
  end of Nov 15 report excerpt 
 Well on December 6 Apple made this announcement   
 Starting today  the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 marks the first direct to consumer product that enables customers to take an electrocardiogram right from their wrist  capturing heart rhythm in a moment when they experience symptoms like a rapid or skipped heart beat and helping to provide critical data to physicians  The irregular rhythm notification feature on Apple Watch can now also occasionally check heart rhythms in the background and send a notification if an irregular heart rhythm that appears to be atrial fibrillation  AFib  is identified 
 Did this news put a dent in BEAT shares  Not even a scratch for a stock that has weathered the Nov Dec stock market heart stopping chop better than most 
 As I said last month  I would be a buyer of BEAT and its low 30s P E multiple any time it dips into the  50s  That s still the drum I m pounding 
 
Since the Zacks Rank first delivered Papa John s as a Strong Sell in March when shares were trading above  60  the stock has been a dough making machine    primarily for the bears  
 Even a summer fall rally from below  40 back up to  60 just provided another chance to sell  or short  as the stock has cratered back to  44 this month 
 Despite that period of rising optimism  what has never changed is the deterioration in the profit outlook from analysts  And the most recent earnings miss only brought more estimate cuts with full year 2019 EPS sliding from  1 68 to  1 54 
 That slide represents only 4 5  earnings growth next year  after a 44  collapse in profitability this year 
 Here s a great way to visualize this fundamental decline using the Zacks proprietary Price   Consensus chart which plots changes in annual earnings estimates against the stock price  Red and green arrows also highlight beats and misses   
 What PZZA lovers want to see here is a turn back upwards in those 2019 estimates 
 Until then  try a different pie  The Zacks Rank will let you know

Twitter  TWTR  Surges to Become S P 500 s Top Monthly Gainer
At one point during Wednesday trading hours  shares of Twitter were up more than 6   bringing the social media company s month to date gains up to 17  and giving it the strongest December rally of any stock in the S P 500 
With no obvious news to cite for today s surge  investors were pointing to favorable technical patterns to explain why Twitter was in the green once again  Regardless  the stock has clearly returned to favor in recent weeks  despite lingering uncertainty in broader markets 
The story of Twitter s latest bout of momentum starts back in July  The stock had become one of 2018 s top momentum picks  tallying gains of about 90  en route to a 52 week high of  47 79 per share  But shares moved sharply lower after Twitter warned of a drop in users amid its purging of fake accounts and efforts to prevent malicious content 
While Twitter still has a long way to go if it wants to see those mid summer levels again  it s recent run has been impressive  Shares found a bottom in October as the rest of the market was sputtering and the internet company managed to rally more than 20  in what was a brutal month for most major indexes  At today s high of  37 14  Twitter shares were nearly 39  above that October low and on track to carry some serious momentum into the New Year 
The next best December performer in the S P 500 is NRG Energy  which had gained almost 11  on the month through late afternoon trading hours Wednesday  The index itself is down more than 2 5  so far this month  as investors worried about trade disputes and global economic conditions have not quite found their  Santa Claus Rally  
Twitter is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This is because earnings estimate revisions have been largely positive as of late  In fact  the company has witnessed 13 upward revisions against just two downward revisions to its fiscal 2018 earnings estimates within the last 60 days  Twitter is now expected to finish the year with EPS growth in excess of 84

Investment Research 5 Relative Price Strength Stocks to Maximize Your ReturnsWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get

25858,247373,BEAT,Rolling Option Considerations  A Real Life Example With BEAT,opinion,"Exit Strategies for covered call writing is the third required skill for successful implementation of this strategy  stock selection and option selection are the first two   This is also known as position management  One of the most common situations we face each month is when the strike price we initially sold is expiring in the money  stock price is higher than the strike price  and we are considering retaining the underlying security  On August 15  2017  Jesse contacted me and shared a trade that required analysis for a possible rolling execution  Since the email was 4 days prior to contract expiration  Jesse and I agreed that final management decisions would be reserved for Thursday or Friday of expiration week  However  we also felt that it would be instructive to do an analysis using current stats if expiration was upon us 
Jesse s trade with BioTelemetry Inc  NASDAQ BEAT 
Buy 100 BEAT at  33 63
Sell August  34 00 call at  1 67
Current share price is  36 65
Cost to close the August  34 00 call    3 10
Sell to open the September  34 00 call    3 40  rolling out 
Sell to open the September  37 00 call    1 50  rolling out and up 
These statistics were gleaned from the option chains displayed below slightly favoring the market maker 

Calculations using the Ellman Calculator
Next we enter the option chain information into the  What Now  tab of the   blue cells on left side of spreadsheet  and the results will appear in the white cells on the right side as shown here 

The spreadsheet shows the following initial results 
Rolling out to the September  34 00 call results in a 0 88   11  annualized  yellow field  1 month return with 7 20  downside protection of that profit
Rolling out and up to the September  37 00 call results in an initial return of 3 09  with a possible 4 12  final return if share value moves up to the  37 00 strike by expiration
Discussion
As expiration Friday approaches and our strikes are in the money  we are faced with 3 possible choices  We can allow assignment and sell our shares at the agreed upon strike price thereby maximizing our near month covered call trade  The second path is to roll out to the forward month same strike   34 00 in this case  The third path is to roll out and up to the forward month higher strike  Given the calculator results shown in this article  most covered call writers would opt for allowing assignment or rolling out and up as rolling out offers too low of a time value return

Going by historical trends and economic indicators that foresee positive effect on financial markets following the elections  it will be prudent to invest in a few growth stocks that could gain from Tuesday s polls 
A Divided Government Could Drive Stocks Higher
Tuesday s election is widely expected to see Democrats gaining control over the House of Representatives  while Republicans will probably retain control of the Senate  According to MFS Investment Management  such a diversification across the Senate and House of Representatives may drive stocks upward this election season  based on historical data from 1961 2010

The performance of financial markets relies largely on seasonal trends instead of mere speculation  According to RiskHedge  there have been 18 mid term elections since 1946  and following each election  stocks have soared higher for a year  In the last 72 years  stocks have jumped as much as 17  on average in the 12 months after a mid term election 
The trend has continued through every possible combination of a divided government in the House and Senate and yet  the outcome has been the same  thus strengthening the hopes of a better performing market following the mid term election 
 Some pre midterm volatility could be in the cards  but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms  back to 1946   the S P 500 was higher a year later every single time   added Ryan Detrick  Senior Market Strategist at LPL Financial Research 
To further solidify RiskHedge s and LPL Financial s report  investors can consider S P Capital IQ s study  which concluded that the S P 500 has gained 15 3   on average in the six months following a mid term election in the third year of a given presidency s term  as in this case with the Trump administration  The study also found that the trend has an accuracy of 94  based on their research in the timeframe Oct 31  1944   Sep 29  2014

25861,247376,BEAT,5 Relative Price Strength Stocks To Maximize Your Returns,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen

Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors   AAII   proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five and 10  year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns for the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite may opt for

potential outperformers  While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul  companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance  I would much

Driehaus had said in an interview Screening ParametersThe percentage 50 day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the

price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy  In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  as well as a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential   Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see     Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2  Strong

      Aaron s  Inc   NYSE   NYSE AAN       and Petmed Express Inc  NASDAQ   NASDAQ PETS         Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Trump  Terror Hint at Market Pullback  5 Ultra Safe PicksInvestors seem to be getting increasingly anxious about President Trump s capability to push through his pro business agenda  The backlash following his remarks on the violent protests in Charlottesville  which also led to the exodus of business executives from his prominent councils  aggravated matters  In the wake of these  Trump s senior adviser Steve Bannon s dismissal from the White House raised hue and cry among the Republican congress men   Heightened terror fears added to the malaise after several lives were lost after a van plowed into a crowd in Barcelona Such developments compelled U S  stock benchmarks to close lower  while a measure of market volatility scaled higher  Some strategists also believe that the market is now the most expensive since 2003  which might result in further selloffs Thanks to the bearish trends  investing in stocks unperturbed by market gyrations seems to be a prudent choice Increased Volatility Indicate Bearish Market ProspectsLately  there has been a lot of evidence that volatility is making a comeback  The so called  fear index   the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   has climbed around 50  so far this month  And if it remains so till the end of this month  it will be the highest one month percentage increase since August 2015  The VIX is already up 10  on a year to date basis  Thanks to such an upward trajectory  the VIX s 10 day moving average has crossed its 100 day moving average  a sign of further spike in volatility and stock market decline Skittish investors have already left Wall Street in fears of additional pullbacks  The Dow Jones and the S P 500 booked the second straight weekly loss  with the blue chip index suffering its steepest two week percentage decline since mid September 2016  The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite  in the meanwhile  logged its fourth straight weekly loss  its longest losing weekly streak since May 2016 Anxiety Increases Over Trump s UnpopularityU S  equities closed off session lows after Steve Bannon left the administration  The departure of Bannon exposed a lot of disagreement in the Trump era Republican Party  Such differences are hampering Trump administration s efforts to kick start the pro economic policies  Needless to say  Trump s promises on deregulation  trimming taxes and increasing infrastructure outlays  did  help the broader markets gain traction and climb to record highs this year Bannon s departure may offer some clarity concerning the balance of power in the White House  but  the timing was disastrous  Republican congress leaders are seriously frayed following Trump s abstruse remarks on the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of a counter protester at the hands of a suspected Nazi sympathizer  In fact  he added to the woes of his own administration by saying  both sides  are liable for the bloodshed The real estate magnets  approval rating has tanked to a record low as his words and actions continue to rattle investors  Several top executives have already parted ways with Trump and have condemned his confrontational response to the Charlottesville incident Terror Concerns LingerStocks witnessed an extended slide after terrorists struck a crowded tourist street  A van  last week  went through a crowd of tourists in Barcelona  killing at least 13  Such a dastardly act was followed by a second attack in Cambrils  where police said they had shot five terrorists  Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14  with 130 others severely injured Travel and leisure stocks took a beating along with banks  while industries across the board were caught in the downturn  Such unfortunate events remind us that the geopolitical risks still pose a threat  with nerves still raw from the escalated tensions in North Korea Bet on These 5 Safe Stocks NowConcerns about Trump administration s policy paralysis are weighing on stocks  while intensified terror is adding to the malaise  The market  in the meanwhile  is now more expensive that it has been since the dot com era  a reason for further pullbacks  According to a report by Bank of America  NYSE BAC   the S P 500 s forward price earnings ratio touched its highest level in thirteen and a half years  last month  read more    With the markets apprehending a healthy pullback  investing in stocks that are immune to market gyrations seems judicious  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have yielded positive returns

26040,247555,BEAT,Trump   Terror Hint At Market Pullback  5 Ultra Safe Picks,opinion,Investors seem to be getting increasingly anxious about President Trump s capability to push through his pro business agenda  The backlash following his remarks on the violent protests in Charlottesville  which also led to the exodus of business executives from his prominent councils  aggravated matters  In the wake of these  Trump s senior adviser Steve Bannon s dismissal from the White House raised hue and cry among the Republican congress men   Heightened terror fears added to the malaise after several lives were lost after a van plowed into a crowd in Barcelona Such developments compelled U S  stock benchmarks to close lower  while a measure of market volatility scaled higher  Some strategists also believe that the market is now the most expensive since 2003  which might result in further selloffs Thanks to the bearish trends  investing in stocks unperturbed by market gyrations seems to be a prudent choice Increased Volatility Indicate Bearish Market ProspectsLately  there has been a lot of evidence that volatility is making a comeback  The so called  fear index   the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   has climbed around 50  so far this month  And if it remains so till the end of this month  it will be the highest one month percentage increase since August 2015  The VIX is already up 10  on a year to date basis  Thanks to such an upward trajectory  the VIX s 10 day moving average has crossed its 100 day moving average  a sign of further spike in volatility and stock market decline Skittish investors have already left Wall Street in fears of additional pullbacks  The Dow Jones and the S P 500 booked the second straight weekly loss  with the blue chip index suffering its steepest two week percentage decline since mid September 2016  The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite  in the meanwhile  logged its fourth straight weekly loss  its longest losing weekly streak since May 2016 Anxiety Increases Over Trump s UnpopularityU S  equities closed off session lows after Steve Bannon left the administration  The departure of Bannon exposed a lot of disagreement in the Trump era Republican Party  Such differences are hampering Trump administration s efforts to kick start the pro economic policies  Needless to say  Trump s promises on deregulation  trimming taxes and increasing infrastructure outlays  did  help the broader markets gain traction and climb to record highs this year Bannon s departure may offer some clarity concerning the balance of power in the White House  but  the timing was disastrous  Republican congress leaders are seriously frayed following Trump s abstruse remarks on the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of a counter protester at the hands of a suspected Nazi sympathizer  In fact  he added to the woes of his own administration by saying  both sides  are liable for the bloodshed The real estate magnets  approval rating has tanked to a record low as his words and actions continue to rattle investors  Several top executives have already parted ways with Trump and have condemned his confrontational response to the Charlottesville incident Terror Concerns LingerStocks witnessed an extended slide after terrorists struck a crowded tourist street  A van  last week  went through a crowd of tourists in Barcelona  killing at least 13  Such a dastardly act was followed by a second attack in Cambrils  where police said they had shot five terrorists  Both the incidents have claimed the lives of at least 14  with 130 others severely injured Travel and leisure stocks took a beating along with banks  while industries across the board were caught in the downturn  Such unfortunate events remind us that the geopolitical risks still pose a threat  with nerves still raw from the escalated tensions in North Korea Bet on These 5 Safe Stocks NowConcerns about Trump administration s policy paralysis are weighing on stocks  while intensified terror is adding to the malaise  The market  in the meanwhile  is now more expensive that it has been since the dot com era  a reason for further pullbacks  According to a report by Bank of America Corp   NYSE BAC    the S P 500 s forward price earnings ratio touched its highest level in thirteen and a half years  last month  read more    With the markets apprehending a healthy pullback  investing in stocks that are immune to market gyrations seems judicious  The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have yielded

26097,247612,BEAT,5 Stocks To Buy For The Post Obamacare Era,opinion,"Last Wednesday  President Trump reiterated his commitment to replace the Affordable Care Act with new healthcare legislation  But even as Trump prepares to repeal the last administration s signature reform  support for Obamacare is growing  Recent polls have found that more Americans approve of the healthcare law than ever before 
At this point  the exact nature of the new legislation remains unclear  However  after an initial hiccup  healthcare stocks have prospered under the Trump administration up to now  With concerns about exorbitant drug prices refusing to die down  investors would do well to look at stocks from those industries which are key stakeholders of the healthcare law and possess strong fundamentals 
Healthcare Gains Under Trump
By now  the fact that healthcare sector gained under Obamacare is beyond dispute  The Healthcare Select Sector SPDR has increased more than 130  since the ACA became law in Mar 2010  easily exceeding the S P 500 s return over the same period  And despite the urgency to replace the legislation  the sector has gained 9 7  since Trump s surprise victory 
Earlier this month  the Trump administration moved to reduce the enrollment period for the ACA  This could actually help to get more individuals to sign up for coverage  which is good news for insurers  The likes of Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   and Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   have suffered because of Obamacare  since a large number of individuals with serious illnesses have chosen to opt for healthcare cover  In contrast  not enough young  healthy individuals have enrolled which is essential for costs to even out   
Insurers Likely to Benefit
In fact  Humana has said recently that it will exit ACA exchanges by 2017  Meanwhile  several key mergers have failed to go through  dealing a further blow to the sector  At the same time  nearly all major healthcare insurers have gained substantially since the presidential election 
It is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will hugely benefit insurers  This will allow such companies to become more flexible in their approach  which will help in attracting younger individuals  Also  the Medicare business continues to expand 
Will Hospital Stocks Suffer 
One of the biggest winners under Obamacare was the hospitals industry  Under the ACA  the sector began to get paid for several services which they would earlier have to provide free of charge  However  in a post ACA scenario  several individuals would lose their healthcare coverage  a concern raised even by such prominent Republicans as Ohio Governor John Kasich  This means that hospitals would again have to face a scenario where they wouldn t get paid for several services 
But the threat to the Hospitals stocks seems to have been overestimated  Shares of the likes of LifePoint Health  Inc    NASDAQ LPNT   and Tenet Healthcare Corp    NYSE THC   have gained 12 9  and 48 2   respectively year to date  This is because the fear that the ACA would be abolished without a replacement has proven to be unfounded  And despite Trump s recent statements  a farewell to Obamacare doesn t seem to be in the offing in the near future  Currently  key Republicans and even the White House itself have widely differing opinions on the issue 
Our Choices
Statements from the President and the White House notwithstanding  a quick replacement to the ACA seems to be an unlikely possibility at this time  Even if this does happen individually  certain sectors such as insurance are slated to gain  Still others like hospitals may not drop drastically as was envisioned earlier 
Then again  there is the burgeoning healthcare services sector which may remain largely unaffected by these events  Insurers  hospitals and healthcare service providers with strong fundamentals would make welcome additions to your portfolio in such a scenario

26199,247714,BEAT,7 Stocks With Recent Price Strength To Buy Right Now,opinion,In the stock market  finding a win win strategy is easier said than done  When the markets are choppy with widespread global growth concerns  it is difficult for even an ardent investor to come up with a foolproof approach One could take resort to the commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  But this bears the risk of disappointment as one could fall into value trap if the selected stock s hidden weakness is not identified In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price  So  how about looking for the current winners that have the potential to gain further Here is how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently witnessed a price increase  Actually  stocks backed by recent price strength have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen or remained stable  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set themselves is a rational approach However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  so you need to set other relevant parameters for a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist current as well as potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock saw momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether the market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Current Price 52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are seven of the 12 stocks that made it through this screen MeetMe Inc    NASDAQ MEET   owns and operates a social network  It enables users to meet

26312,247827,BEAT,5 Stocks To Watch  BBBY  BEAT  FITB  MDGN  WWAV,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Bed Bath   Beyond  NASDAQ BBBY 
Bed Bath   Beyond made a top at the beginning of 2015 and started back lower  It made a bottom over January and February  after losing nearly 50   The bounce that followed stalled as it hit 52 and it has been pulling back in a bull flag since  Friday may have put an end to that  The RSI is rising and bullish while the MACD is falling but remains positive  Look for upside continuation Monday to participate 
BioTelemetry  NASDAQ BEAT 
BioTelemetry had a quick run to 17 in the summer of 2015  From there it plummeted with healthcare stocks in September before a bounce  That was short lived as it reversed back lower to a bottom spiking down under 9  Since that bottom the price has moved up over its 200 day SMA and is now consolidating  The RSI has reset a bit lower and now turning back up while the MACD remains heading down  Look for a move higher out of consolidation to participate 
Fifth Third  NASDAQ FITB 

Fifth Third was a Top 10 trade idea a few weeks back is it was breaking out of the early year consolidation and above the neckline of the Inverse Head and Shoulders  The price is still shy of the Price Objective of 18 15 from that pattern  but is consolidating again  The RSI is in the bullish zone now and the MACD is rising  Look for a break of consolidation higher to participate 
Medgenics  NYSE MDGN 
Medgenics fell from a high over  10 in September to make a low print of 3 09  about 70  lower  in February  This was part of a rounding consolidation that has been going on for all of 2016  Momentum has shifted to the upside with the RSI and MACD bullish  The movement Friday takes the price back to the most recent high on a strong candle  Look for follow through to a new higher high Monday to participate 
WhiteWave Foods  NYSE WWAV 
WhiteWave Foods fell from a top in August making a descending channel from September to mid February  before breaking it to the upside  It retrenched at a higher low over the last two weeks before a move higher Friday  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is about to cross up after a pause  Look for continuation Monday to participate 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with Options Expiration behind and a short week ahead of Easter coming sees the Equity Indexes looking strong 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue higher along with crude oil  Both show risk of a short term pullback  The US Dollar Index looks to test the bottom of the consolidation range while US Treasuries continue lower in their wedge  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside with risk of the Emerging markets running a little lower first 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and biased lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs SPY  NYSE SPY   NYSE IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  Their charts look strong  especially on the weekly timeframe  With the SPY finally over its 200 day SMA and late week action suggesting possible rotation into the IWM to come next  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

BioTelemetry  Inc   NASDAQ BEAT  is still looking good  and on Tuesday it was up another 51 cents to 16 11  or 3    on a solid 835 900 shares traded  That s the second biggest volume in a couple weeks  It looks like it wants to blow through resistance level going back to 2013  If it gets through that  look for it to run up to 21     maybe even mid to high 20s 
Dynavax Technologies Corporation  NASDAQ DVAX  has been consolidating for the last couple months  and on Tuesday it moved up another 1 68 to 29 99  or 6   on 383 300 shares traded  The volume wasn t very strong  but the technicals were very good  If it can get through the 31 00 zone  this stock will fly  The targets are 33  and 38 
FibroGen  Inc   NASDAQ FGEN  had a nice day on Tuesday  up 3 07 to 26 24  or 13   on nearly a million shares  That s the biggest volume in three weeks and the second biggest volume in three months  It s pushing through resistance  which comes in at about the 26 range  It should try 27   maybe as early as Wednesday  The top of the channel shows that there may be a possible move up toward 30 
Amicus Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ FOLD  had a nice pop on Tuesday through the declining top line out of what looks like a head and shoulder pattern  and may be on its way to short covering  seven days to cover  It was up 1 82 to 17 35  or 12   on 2 4 million shares  The immediate target will be a test of the highs around 18 80  If it gets through that look for this stock to run up to the 21 zone  and eventually the mid to high 20s

Agenus Inc AGEN is an example of a stock that exploded and is breaking away  It had two consecutive gaps and two big volume days  Almost 56 million shares traded in two days  On Monday  it was up 88 cents to 6 17  or nearly 17   on 27 million shares  Looking at the long term chart  you ll see that there is resistance up around the 7 00 range  That should be the short term target in the next day or two 
Hutchinson Technology HTCH had a good day yesterday  up 55 cents to 4 25  or almost 15   on 1 1 million shares  It had a gap  and then a run up to resistance  A little bit of additional resistance occurs around 4 85  That could be the next move  but the overall structure shows a massive head and shoulders pattern  which could put the next move into the high single digits 
Juno Therapeutics JUNO  a fairly new IPO  had an excellent day yesterday  up 7 24 to 61 51 or 13   on 2 6 million shares  Looking at the 15 minute chart  you can see that after the run up and consolidation  it broke out on Monday  Look for this one to head up towards the 70 72 zone 
Silver Standard Resources SSRI is one of several silver stocks that broke out yesterday  up 52 cents to 6 29  or 9   on 3 8 million shares  The key is that the base is broken and the volume is picking up  The next target could be a test of 6 71 early on  and then the 7 7 1 4 range  The secondary target is set at 7 3 4 8

Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN  had a fantastic day on Tuesday  up 7 20 to 172 74  or 4   on 8 5 million shares  It has been in a very long consolidation  Since Dec  it has made five attempts at getting through the highs at 174 00  If it is able to get through 174 00  and Tuesday s high was 174 80  a nominal new high  it may very well extend  It could quite possibly take AMGN up near the 200 210 zone  That s the next target for swing trade on AMGN 
Fitbit Inc   NYSE FIT   a recent IPO  was up 1 54 to 45 47  or 3 5   on 3 7 million shares on Tuesday  Initially  this stock did very well  and ran up sharply to the top of the channel  and then pulled back  After a 3 wave  corrective pullback  it tested support  and bounced nicely  It ran up above the moving averages on the 50 minute chart and looked like it was going to have a blowout move  and it still may  Once it hits 47 00  it could be off to the races  The next target is 55 
Flamel Technologies SA  NASDAQ FLML   a stock that we ve been following for a while  and formerly a swing trade of ours  was up 1 13 to 25 69  or 4 6   on average volume  on Tuesday  It s looking very good  has a nice rising channel  moved across major resistance  flagged  and extended  Look for it to eventually get to as high as 36  The short term target is 28 
Novavax  Inc   NASDAQ NVAX   a swing trade of ours  is acting well  up 57 cents to 12 20  or 5   on 3 3 million shares on Tuesday  and is on the border of a breakout  It had a breakout in June  ran up  flagged  ran up again  flagged  pulled back  and in the last couple days it has been a little bit more difficult  but a lot of biotechs were  and on Tuesday  it had a nice snapback off an internal trendline  If that is the case  look for this to make it up to 14  and then 16 1 2

BioTelemetry  Inc   NASDAQ BEAT  is one of those stocks that has been acting well of late  It broke out with a thrust early July  flagged  wedged  popped  and broke out on Monday  up 35 cents to 14 04  The interesting thing about Monday s low is it was right on the breakout point  down about the 12 31 low  and it ran up to 14 33  before pulling back and closing at 14 04  The fact that it closed positive says that this may be a 15 1 2 16 dollar stock short term  maybe more 
Caesars Entertainment Corporation  NASDAQ CZR  has been wonderful the last three weeks  going from 4 3 4 to 9 00  On Monday  in the face of a lousy market  even though it dipped in the morning  it still closed up 96 cents to 8 98  or 12   on 3 7 million shares  but ran all the way up to 9 23  At this point  since this is practically in break out mode  and as a result of that  if there is any extension  you could see this run up towards the 11 11 1 2 range

Dermira  Inc   NASDAQ DERM  has really been acting well  up 24 cents to 25 94 on Tuesday  It s not a heavily traded stock  but it does have a very strong chart pattern  The fifth wave up may be underway  but I want to see it get through the double top  Resistance is at the 27 76 level  which is the short term target  The secondary target is 30  and then maybe 32 
Lipocine Inc   NASDAQ LPCN  is doing very well  Even though it did get a sharp pullback  it held the trendline and lateral price support as well as the moving averages and 50 day  and bounced nicely on Tuesday  It was up 87 cents to 15 59  or 6   on 437 301  The volume was okay  not great  but what I m looking at is if it can get through the 15 90 16 00 zone to test the old spike highs up about 17 83  If it gets through that  then look for 20 21 as the next target 
Stocks on the Short Side   
CEB Inc   NYSE CEB  is looking pretty bad  On Monday  I talked to you about the bear wedge  On Tuesday  it got clobbered for 2 69 to 68 93  It looks like it s going to test the Jan lows around 66 3 4 67 as early as Wed morning  Through that it could see 64  even 59 60 to fill the gap 
Criteo SA  NASDAQ CRTO  had a big drop last week in which we did great  but when it rallied back to resistance  we weren t sure about it  It is rolling over  On Tuesday  it dropped another 2 08 to 37 13  Unless it bounces on Wednesday  it could come down to the low 30 s

Builders FirstSource  Inc   NASDAQ BLDR  has been doing very well  After the explosion in April  they consolidated for several months digesting the gains  of course  and merger  It then popped  pulled back  held the trend line  and now the snapback is under way  On Wednesday  it jumped 1 05 to 15 45  or 7 4   on 1 8 million shares  That s the biggest volume in several weeks  It s up against resistance  Look for a test of the 17 dollar range short term  and then 20 1 2  Those are the targets 
Flotek Industries Inc   NYSE FTK  is looking good  It popped another 1 01 to 20 20  or 5 3   on 2 7 million shares on Wednesday  That s the strongest volume in 5 6 weeks as it breaks out across key resistance  The gap at 20 33 was tested with a 20 27 tick  If it gets into the gap fill  or even higher  I could see this stock at 23 23 1 2 short term 
Lipocine Inc   NASDAQ LPCN  is acting great  up on Wednesday 1 34 to 16 93  or 8 6   Since June  the base pattern was taken out with a thrust  they formed a flag or wedge  another explosive move took place  and then they had a sharp pullback  That held the trendline  price support  and moving averages  and came sharply off of that  It s been up 7 consecutive days  I expect it to test 17 3 4 18  and then run with a target of 21 1 2 22 
Trevena  Inc   NASDAQ TRVN  has been exploding out of a base pattern  up on Tuesday  and on Wednesday  it was up another 2 35 to 11 44  or 26   on 11 6 million shares  It s been up 5 days in a row  and reached a new IPO high  Any pullback consolidation in that zone could set it up for mid teens
