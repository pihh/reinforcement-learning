194381,415897,UAL,British Airways  Iberia suspend direct flights to mainland China amid virus fears,news,"LONDON  Reuters    British Airways  L ICAG  has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China  one of the biggest names in aviation to do so  as worries grow about the impact of the spreading coronavirus on global travel 
BA com  the airline s website  shows no direct flights to mainland China are available to book in January or February  but the airline said in an email that the cancellations were in effect until Jan  31 while it assesses the situation 
Direct flights to the Chinese ruled autonomous region of Hong Kong were unaffected 
Iberia  part of the IAG group along with BA  said on Wednesday it was temporarily suspending all flights to Shanghai  its only mainland Chinese destination   because of coronavirus  
BA s move followed some flight cancellations to China by U S  airline United Airlines Holdings Inc  O UAL   which blamed a sharp fall in demand 
Fears over the spread of the flu like virus  which originated in the central city of Wuhan  are growing as the death toll rose to 132 and countries warned their citizens over travel to China 
Britain s Foreign Office on Tuesday advised against  all but essential  travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak 
BA said customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days could find out more on its website 
 We apologize to customers for the inconvenience  but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority   BA said in an emailed statement on Wednesday 
UK based airline Virgin Atlantic said its flights to Shanghai would continue to operate as scheduled 
British Airways usually flies daily between London s Heathrow airport and both Beijing and Shanghai 
The temporary suspension of flights comes days after BA had offered passengers the chance to cancel or rebook tickets to China during February  a move which could have resulted in its large long haul jets flying half empty 
Iberia s suspension  which will last throughout February  will come into force from Friday  when its next Madrid Shanghai flight had been due to fly 
According to analysts  IAG  L ICAG   the group which owns BA and Iberia  is less exposed to the Asia Pacific region on a capacity basis compared to rival European airlines like Air France KLM  PA AIRF  and Lufthansa  DE LHAG  
Asia Pacific accounts for about 19  of both Air France KLM and Lufthansa s available seat kilometers and 8  of IAG s in 2019  Goodbody analysts said ",2020-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/british-airways-iberia-suspend-direct-flights-to-mainland-china-amid-virus-fears-2070943,2070943

194384,415900,UAL,China virus puts cruise ships in quarantine  hits carmakers  airlines and Airbus,news,"By Se Young Lee and Winni Zhou
BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    Thousands of passengers and crew on two cruise ships in Asian waters were placed in quarantine for China s coronavirus on Wednesday as airlines  car manufacturers and other global companies counted the cost of the fast spreading outbreak

194385,415901,UAL,Coronavirus  Its Impact On Oil Markets Till Now,opinion,"Last week  the coronavirus s impact on markets was mostly conjecture 

There was a lack of information about the disease itself how quickly it would spread  how fatal it would be  the number of people who would be infected and the magnitude the quarantine would reach 

Speculation was nevertheless rampant  The result  investors could not accurately anticipate the effect on oil prices  the global economy or  more specifically  the Chinese economy particularly its workforce  production and transportation   







In the coming days and weeks  more concrete data will emerge about the economy in light of the outbreak 
Below is a breakdown of what is known about the impact of the virus on oil markets now 
SARS Comparisons
Many investors and analysts made comparisons with the SARS outbreak in 2003  Markets dropped when the virus hit in 2003  and so markets in 2020 both equities and  dived as well  
The  is not reliable in showing the influence of an outbreak on global economic expansion  Since the SARS outbreak in China corresponded with the U S  invasion of Iraq  it is difficult to separate the two major events 

China s economy has transformed since the 2003 SARS outbreak and the nation appears to be responding more responsibly to coronavirus today  As well  the outbreaks occurred at different times of the year 
Industries Already Taking A Hit 
More than a week after the first public reports of the outbreak  the ramifications for global economies and oil demand are starting to reveal themselves  The coronavirus will adversely impact airlines and the jet fuel market  

United  NASDAQ UAL    Air Canada   TSX AC   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   Lufthansa  OTC DLAKY   British Airways  OTC BABWF  and Cathay Pacific  OTC CPCAY  are all altering their service to China 

 Some are  flights between China and North America or Europe for a period of several weeks   Others are reducing their flight load  Long haul flights between Asia and the United States or Western Europe use a lot of jet fuel  
For example  a  between Los Angeles and Tokyo uses about 9 500 gallons of jet fuel  which is about 226 barrels  More airlines may suspend flights to China in the coming days  and airlines within China have already begun suspending travel 
Long Term Concerns Mount  OPEC Scrambles The bigger worry among traders is that the virus will lead to a general and sustained decrease in economic activity in China and  potentially  in other parts of the world 

The effect of coronavirus on global crude oil demand is clearly a concern for OPEC 

OPEC and its OPEC  partners believed they had addressed the issue of weak demand in Q1 and Q2 with their new Q1 production cuts  Members were already discussing dispensing with the planned March meeting and agreeing to extend these cuts through June  Then coronavirus fears sent oil prices tumbling last week and this week 

In a move that looks desperate  Algeria  which is currently serving its one year term as OPEC President  announced that OPEC is   the March meeting up to February  

This makes many investors wonder if OPEC is panicking  The Saudi oil minister said a few days ago that they were  closely monitoring  oil markets  which was a more reserved response  It is unclear how a rushed OPEC  meeting would help stabilize prices since OPEC  has had little success increasing them with its most recent cuts  even with one million barrels of oil from Libya currently off the market 

Ultimately  if coronavirus continues to scare traders in the weeks and months to come  oil traders may swap in their geologist friends for epidemiologists ",2020-01-30,"Ellen R. Wald, Ph.D.",https://www.investing.com/analysis/coronavirus-its-impact-on-oil-markets-till-now-200502968,200502968

194435,415951,UAL,Should Value Investors Pick United Airlines  UAL  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put United Airlines Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ UAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  United Airlines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 40  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 77  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts United Airlines  current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 8 33  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 94  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that United Airlines has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 29  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for United Airlines  stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  United Airlines has a P S ratio of about 0 52  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 42 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  United Airlines currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes UAL a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for United Airlines is just 0 36  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0 62  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 01  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 5 42  Clearly  UAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though United Airlines might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives UAL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher and one lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate witnessed two upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineUnited Airlines is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 29  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment  estimates and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from Zacks Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through Q3 2019  while the S P

194450,415966,UAL,United  Avianca and Copa s South American deal delayed as they mull fourth partner,news,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
BRASILIA  Reuters    A proposed joint venture between United Airlines  O UAL   Colombia s Avianca Holdings  CN AVT p  and Panama s Copa Holdings  N CPA  has been delayed due to the potential inclusion of Brazil s  Azul SA   N AZUL  as a fourth partner  as well as problems at Avianca  the CEOs of two of the companies said 
The three airlines had said in November 2018 they would file for U S  antitrust approval  in the near term  in order to coordinate routes between South America and the United States  a bold move to expand their market share in the region  At the time  the carriers said they aimed to implement the agreements in 2020 
United said last week it wants to include Azul  in which it already has a stake  in the planned tie up with Copa and Avianca  the latest play by a U S  carrier for a region expected to have significant air travel growth in coming decades 
But almost a year after United  Copa and Avianca announced the preliminary joint venture plan  they have yet to file any paperwork with the U S  Department of Transportation  seeking antitrust immunity  Now  the regulatory process may begin as late as next year 
Copa s CEO  Pedro Heilbron  said the group expects to file in early 2020  while Avianca s CEO  Anko van der Werff  said it would file between late 2019 and early 2020  Both spoke to Reuters in separate interviews on Monday on the sidelines of the ALTA Airline Leaders  Forum in Brasilia 
Both said there was a delay on the original timeline 
United did not respond to a request for comment  Azul had no comment other than saying it was  always looking for opportunities with its partners  
The potential inclusion of Azul  which may be in the early stages of negotiations  has been one reason for the timetable slipping 
 Quite frankly  really completely open and honest  we haven t had many discussions   van der Werff said   I personally haven t had even one real  serious discussion at the CEO level about when to include  Azul  and what to include  
Both executives said they want Azul to be part of the joint venture   Brazil is by far the largest aviation market in the region   but its inclusion makes negotiations more difficult 
 It almost doubles the level of complexity   Heilbron said 
Avianca has also gone through corporate turmoil  In May  United Airlines ousted the chairman and controlling shareholder at Avianca  revamping leadership 
 We should have filed with regulators this year but everything got delayed because of what has happened at Avianca   Heilbron added ",2019-10-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/united-avianca-and-copas-south-american-deal-delayed-as-they-mull-fourth-partner-2006058,2006058

demand  taking a look at travel and leisure companies will be judicious  As bulk of the travel is expected to be via road  rental car giants are poised to be among the biggest gainers Higher travel

93 000 daily passengers this time around What s Boosting Travel This Thanksgiving A4A Vice President and Chief Economist John Heimlich said that  the popularity of air travel continues to soar this

Twidale  vice president  AAA Travel said that  Strong economic fundamentals are motivating Americans to venture out this holiday in near record numbers  Consumer spending remains strong  thanks to increasing wages  disposable income and household wealth  and travel remains one of their top priorities for the holiday season  5 Stocks to Ride the Thanksgiving RushWith the rise in income levels

194490,416006,UAL,Q4 Weakness Continues In Broad Based Selloff,opinion," Wednesday Market Close  Sometimes investors can find a sector to hide in when stocks take it on the chin  Not on Wednesday  as concerns about overseas economic weakness and trade wars ganged up on the market and took everything down with them 

Cyclical sectors that tend to fall in times of economic concern got slammed  but so did  defensive  sectors like Utilities and Consumer Staples as stocks suffered the worst day since late August  Small caps are getting hit hard  and are within a few points of bear market territory  Only bonds and gold really got a lift Wednesday as it looks like caution is back in a big way 
Consumers Still Running the Show 
Until this week  healthy U S  consumers appeared to keep the momentum flowing on Wall Street despite economic weakness in Europe and trade worries  The consumer has been carrying growth domestically  but with so much continued weak data elsewhere  there s growing fear it could start to hit U S  shoppers  That said  we haven t seen anything yet pointing to a weakening U S  consumer  only some hints that sentiment about the future might be coming down  We d arguably need to see a slowdown in wage growth or a drop in retail sales  and not for just a single report  to verify any change in the consumer picture here 
While many analysts believe recession concerns are overblown  we could get more clues about U S  consumer health in coming days  The payrolls report Friday might be paramount  If it shows wage growth declining  that could potentially lead people to believe economic problems are getting worse and send the market down again 
To keep things in perspective  this was only the second day of heavy selling  which is far from a trend  There s nothing unusual about what s happening  and major technical support levels didn t get breached  All of this might offer some hope for later this week  especially as investors await key jobs data from the government on Friday  
Heightened Economic Concerns Sparked by New Trade Fears
Growing economic worries  which got their initial spark on Tuesday from soft U S  manufacturing data Tuesday  appeared to get worse Wednesday  That was partly due in part to a World Trade Organization  WTO  decision that raised fears of more trade tension between the U S  and Europe even as the U S  grapples over trade relations with China  
The U S  plans to impose tariffs on  7 5 billion of E U  imports after the WTO s ruling  The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday  This added to trade trepidation and might have helped pressure the market after it posted some recovery from its lows earlier in the afternoon  By the closing bell  the Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  was down 800 points in just two days  It s a little like the quick descent we saw back in early August  which was also trade related  

Transports really put on the brakes  with some of the major airlines like United Airlines Holdings Inc  NASDAQ UAL  and Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  getting smacked around  Both fell more than 5  by late in the session  Auto manufacturers also had a bad day  On days like these  you d almost expect to see weakness in more aggressive parts of the market like transports  Technology and Energy  but it was a bit surprising to see Utilities fall 1 25   Health Care fall 1 5   and Consumer Staples fall nearly 2   Those are the places some investors tend to go when things get volatile 
Instead  it looks like people fled Wednesday away from equities and into bonds and gold  The U S  10 year Treasury yield fell back below 1 6   For reference  it was briefly above 1 9  in mid September  One point to potentially watch is 1 42   which is around the three year low that the 10 year yield posted back in early September  Some analysts think that barring a re test of that  the market won t necessarily fall out of bed 
Gold climbed 1  to back above  1 500 an ounce  That s still a ways from the early September highs up around  1 560  which could be another level worth watching if you re tracking investor sentiment 
Eyeing the Surface Cracks
The U S  economy has chugged along  growing around 2  even while some other economies see slower growth and grapple with negative interest rates  Now there appear to be a few cracks on the surface  which we saw early this week with a round of weak data from the U S  and overseas  along with political worries at home and geopolitical turmoil in Asia  the U K   and the Middle East  
With October a historically volatile and sometimes difficult month  it seems pretty natural that some people might approach things with caution here and lighten the load a bit  What s not really apparent yet is any major change in the pattern that would lead you to think it s a repeat of Q4 2018 when things really went south 
Some people are making comparisons to the Q4 washout last year  but that s not really all that valid  For one thing  rates are falling  not rising as they were then  Also  the market isn t as reliant on the fortunes of just a few big companies like it was a year ago  The rally since January has been pretty widespread  with Technology a leader but also with participation from lots of other sectors  

Some immediate cracks in the bullish thesis showed up with yesterday s U S  manufacturing data  auto U K  construction PMI  and growth warnings from Germany s leading institutes  Brexit jitters and China trade worries haven t gone away either  but they ve been out there all year and the SPX was up 20  in going into October 
As we noted earlier this week  October could have some bright spots despite the troubled start  Talks with China begin next week  Earnings season is getting close and could offer a welcome break from all the noise 
Getting Technical

Consider taking a breath and remembering the 2800 to 3000 range we ve been talking about for the S P 500  We re coming off the high end of that range and heading down  but unless the SPX takes out lows near the 200 day moving average which is around 2837 as of Wednesday you could argue we re still not technically in really bearish territory  A test of that level or a drop below it for a day or two might change sentiment on the Street in a major way 
That said  there s nothing wrong with being cautious or even taking some profit if you feel your exposure to stocks is higher than you originally planned  Where people might go wrong is by making seat of the pants trading decisions based on fear instead of their long term goals  The SPX fell to 2350 last December  and anyone who got nervous and sold then might be regretting it now  Sure  there s no rule that says the SPX can t fall back to that point  Even so  if you believe earnings can start to recover in coming quarters and we don t face any signs of an immediate recession  that might be a tough argument to make 
The Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  ran up some gains Tuesday and Wednesday to back above 20 for the first time since early August  Still  it s stayed below the August highs so far  That might bear watching  especially if it goes above 22 or 23  A move like that could potentially signal more concern and possibly more market turbulence ahead  because that s pretty much where things topped out in August

194538,416054,UAL,Foreign airlines to face new rivals on popular China routes as restrictions ease,news,By Brenda Goh SHANGHAI  Reuters    Foreign airlines that fly on 20 popular long haul routes to China will face fresh competitive pressure as Beijing begins to ease decade old restrictions on Oct  1  allowing more Chinese carriers to offer service  The change affects about 20 percent of Chinese long haul daily capacity  according to data compiled for Reuters by Chinese aviation data firm Variflight   It will turn up the heat on U S  and European carriers like United Airlines  O UAL  and Air France KLM  PA AIRF   which have higher costs  lower outbound demand from their countries and less cultural appeal to Chinese travelers   The North American and European airlines are no match for the Chinese carriers   said Corrine Png  chief executive of Singapore based transport consultancy Crucial Perspective  citing the majority of traffic being driven by Chinese customers   Some have already abandoned Chinese routes  with American Airlines  O AAL  recently planning to drop Shanghai Chicago service after also cancelling Beijing Chicago and describing the routes as a  colossal loss maker  that cost it  30 million a year  The  one route  one airline  policy had been in place since 2009  altering it now is a response to the changing aviation market  China s Civil Aviation Authority has said  Two of the routes  Shanghai Paris and Shanghai Frankfurt  already have two Chinese airlines flying them but can add one more   LITTLE INFLUENCE  Variflight s chief data analyst  Cong Wei  said Chinese airlines controlled about 50 percent of the seats on the 20 routes  which include Beijing Los Angeles and Shanghai London  and had the potential for a much higher share   These routes are divided up between state controlled carriers China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd  SS 600115   China Southern Airlines Co  SS 600029  and Air China Ltd  SS 601111    They compete against foreign airlines including Air France KLM  Lufthansa  DE LHAG    Air Canada   TO AC   British Airways  L ICAG   Virgin Atlantic  VA UL   Air New Zealand  NZ AIR   United Airlines  Delta Air Lines  N DAL  and American Airlines  An Air France KLM spokeswoman said the company was monitoring the regulation change but had  very little influence on how this rule could evolve     Competition between Europe and China is already present and increasing   the spokeswoman said   We continue to enhance our existing partnerships to offer the most attractive products and services at competitive fares to all our customers  This is undoubtedly the best response to this eventuality   Delta Air Lines said China continued to be an important market for its long term network and that it was well positioned because of its partnership with China Eastern  Air New Zealand said it was aware of the change and was constantly assessing new route opportunities  Lufthansa  Air Canada  British Airways  Virgin Atlantic  United Airlines and American Airlines did not respond to requests for comment   TIE UPS  The policy would also likely hurt incumbent Chinese airlines like Air China  which under the old rules had been able to dominate the Beijing Los Angeles route  Many Chinese airlines are already facing falling returns on their international business   Rivals like Hainan Airlines  SS 600221   China s fourth largest carrier  have been expanding their international business in secondary routes and could take on new ones  analysts said  Out of the 20 routes opening for competition  Hainan only flies between Beijing and Toronto   China Eastern and China Southern  headquartered respectively in Shanghai and Guangzhou  are also expected to launch new routes from the Beijing once the Chinese capital s new second airport opens in late 2019  giving the two state owned airlines secondary bases   The opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport was a catalyst for the government s decision to change the route policy  the Chinese aviation regulator said in May   China Southern said it supported the policy change  while China Eastern declined to comment  Air China and Hainan Airlines did not respond to requests for comment  Li Xiaojin  a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China  said foreign carriers could focus on developing services for the luxury end of the Chinese market or deepen recently forged tie ups with Chinese carriers to try to retain a competitive edge   Delta Air Lines and American Airlines respectively have small equity stakes in China Eastern and China Southern  while China Eastern owns a 8 8 percent stake in Air France KLM  But Li said the ultimate winner would be Chinese travellers   By liberalizing international air rights  airlines will put more capacity

194539,416055,UAL,New U S  FAA rules on airplane seat size may not create more leg room,news,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson CHICAGO WASHINGTON  Reuters    A bill that will regulate minimum seat size on U S  passenger airplanes for the first time is unlikely to lead to more leg or elbow room for cramped flyers  airline consultants said  The U S  Senate is taking up on Monday the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  reauthorization bill  which funds the agency for five years and sets other travel measures  Final passage is expected on Tuesday or Wednesday  Current rules say airlines must be able to evacuate passengers within 90 seconds of any emergency and do not set specific requirements on seat size or the space between other seats  If passed  the new rules would require a minimum standard based on a safety review   Flyer advocacy groups have demanded new rules to make air travel more comfortable  but experts said safety rather than comfort would likely continue to drive the standard  Currently  seat pitch   the distance from one seat back to the next   on low cost carriers  Spirit Airlines  Inc  N SAVE  and Frontier Airlines is among the industry s tightest at 28 inches  71 cm   The average for other mainline economy seats is 31 inches   But because the FAA has previously approved operations such as Spirit and Frontier s  it is unlikely to now call the 28 pitch unsafe  said Samuel Engel  vice president of aviation at consulting group ICF   It s a mistake to imagine this legislation will have a big impact on airlines or consumers   Engel told Reuters  In July  the FAA said in response to a petition filed with a federal appeals court that it would not regulate seat size  Airlines  margins could suffer if they had to reconfigure planes to create more space  Frontier declined to comment and Spirit did not reply   The FAA could decide the rules only apply to future aircraft and would have at least until late 2019 to write the rules  officials said   American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL  and United Airlines  O UAL  are configuring many of their newest aircraft at 30 inches  while adding premium economy seats at 34 inches  Among other measures in the FAA reauthorization  airlines must increase flight attendants  required rest time  which may create a need for more cabin crew and reduce airlines  flexibility to recover from delayed flights  ICF s Engel noted  The bill also requires the FAA to establish domestic landing and takeoff standards on noise for supersonic jets  a move that could kickstart the fledgling U S  supersonic jet industry despite resistance by European nations that want tough rules on noise

194565,416081,UAL,4 High Earnings Yield Stocks To Solidify Your Portfolio ,opinion,If you are uncertain whether to invest your money in bonds or stocks  an important parameter that can show you the right path is earnings yield  It is the reciprocal of the price to earnings  P E  ratio  This ratio is quite useful when it comes to determining undervalued stocks  Also  this ratio is effective for comparing stocks with the market or fixed income securities Earnings yield can be calculated as  annual earnings per share market price  x 100  While comparing similar stocks  the one with high earnings yield should generate higher returns This ratio is handy for comparing the performance of the market with the 10 year Treasury yield  When the yield of the market index exceeds the 10 year Treasury yield  stocks can be said to be undervalued in comparison to bonds  This implies that investing in the stock market is a better option for a value investor However  while T bills are devoid of risks  investing in stocks always involves some inherent risks  Hence  it will be wise to add a risk premium to the Treasury yield while comparing with the earnings yield of a stock or the broader market The Winning StrategyWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10  as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns  So  we have added the following parameters to the screen Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S P 500  This metric compares the 12 month forward EPS estimate with the 12 month actual EPS Average Daily Volume  20 Day  greater than or equal to 100 000  High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity Current Price greater than or equal to  5 Buy Rated Stocks  Stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment  You can see  Here are four of the 33 stocks that made it through the screen Columbus  OH based DSW Inc    NYSE DBI   designs  produces and retails footwear and accessories  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and an expected EPS growth rate of 15  for the next 3 5 years Maumee  OH based Dana Incorporated   NYSE DAN   is a provider of technology driveline  sealing and thermal management products  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and an expected EPS growth rate of 3 6  for the next 3 5 years Pittsburgh  PA based Koppers Holdings Inc    NYSE KOP   is an integrated global provider of treated wood products  wood treatment chemicals and carbon compounds  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and an expected EPS growth rate of 18  for the next 3 5 years Chicago  IL based United Airlines Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ UAL   is the holding company for both United Airlines and Continental Airlines  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and an expected EPS growth rate of 20 9  for the next 3 5 years You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for a 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software  You can also create your own strategies and test them first before making investments The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   ,2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-high-earnings-yield-stocks-to-solidify-your-portfolio-200436800,200436800
194566,416082,UAL,4 Stocks With Relative Price Strength To Enhance Your Gains,opinion,Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average If a stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid

194609,416125,UAL,Georgia lawmaker threatens to kill Delta state tax breaks over NRA stance,news,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK  Reuters    The lieutenant governor of Georgia on Monday threatened to block legislation that includes lucrative tax benefits for Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  because the Atlanta based airline dropped a partnership with the National Rifle Association after a public backlash in the wake of the recent Florida school shooting 
 I will kill any tax legislation that benefits  Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with  NRA   Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle  a Republican  wrote on Twitter   Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back  
The Feb  14 massacre of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  by a gunman with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle reignited the nation s long running debate over gun rights 
Several U S  companies are cutting ties with the NRA and gun manufacturers in the wake of the shooting 
On Saturday  Delta and United Airlines Inc  UALCO UL   N UAL  said they were no longer offering NRA members discounted rates and they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website 
Delta said its decision reflected a neutral stance in the heated gun control debate  It said it continues to support the Second Amendment  which grants Americans the right to bear arms 
Delta officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday  The airline is one of the largest employers in Georgia 
Cagle s tweet follows a wave of threats to boycott the carrier after Delta s Saturday announcement 
Neither Cagle s office nor the NRA were immediately available for comment 
The Georgia legislature is considering a proposed jet fuel tax exemption designed to benefit Delta  but as of Monday  several state Republicans have threatened to withdraw their support for the provision 
Emory University School of Law Professor Robert Schapiro said that the state has broad discretion in deciding which entities to tax or not tax 
 In terms of legality  the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions   Schapiro said   So it doesn t violate any constitutional principle  to pull support over the NRA debate

194615,416131,UAL,Is Avianca Heading Towards An Inverted H S Pattern Formation ,opinion,"Avianca s  NYSE AVH  performance has been somewhat chaotic  but rather depressing for most of its shareholders ever since it s ADR debut in late 2013  Investors who jumped into Latin America s largest airline and the second oldest in the world after KLM  experienced a tremendous downtrend in its stock during 2014 2015 seeing how the price fell from  17 to under  4 where it reached an all time low at  3 61 
During 2016 and 2017 the stock bounced back at around  10 in rumors that US giant airlines such as Delta or United would buy the Colombian airline to expand their operations and market share in Latin America  being United Airlines the most probable to close a deal with Avianca in the coming years 
However  2018 was not a good year in general for Colombia s Stock Exchange  Avianca was no exception  The rising dollar and low oil prices made investors see emerging markets with reluctant eyes  But  good news seems to appear on the horizon for Avianca and it s shareholders  at least from a technical point of view  A possible Inverted Head   Shoulders pattern formation 
For those of you who are not familiar with this formation  take a look at the following graph 
It shows the behavior of  in this case  a stock which has been down trending forming a left shoulder  a head and a right shoulder  Afterward  comes a bounce back that achieves a breakout and a trend reversal 
Now  take a look at this monthly chart of AVH  See the resemblance

194623,416139,UAL,Higher wages  fuel prices turn up cost pressure on airlines,news,"By Victoria Bryan BERLIN  Reuters    With inflation paramount in investors  minds at a time of rising wages and oil prices  the line separating winners and losers in the global airline industry this year looks likely to be drawn on how well they manage costs  especially on the labor side  Industry body IATA in December flagged higher spending on labor and fuel   which make up about half of airlines  operating expenses   as their members  biggest challenge in 2018  especially after several years of record profits  Labor costs surpassed fuel as global airlines  biggest single expense in 2016  at 22 percent of costs against just under 21 percent for fuel  That is expected to jump this year to 30 9 percent versus 20 5 percent for fuel  Back in 2013  when oil prices were much higher than now  fuel was 33 percent of expenses against 18 percent for labor  Staff costs are typically higher in North America and Europe than in Asia  where fuel remains the biggest expense   The crux of the issue is that amid signs of a global shortage of workers generally  in some regions there s also a scarcity of qualified pilots at a time of expanding fleets   As airlines have been making profit  the workforce has got market power  so that is pushing up the cost of labor   IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said in an interview   Overall  unit costs   the measure of how much it costs an airline to operate each kilometer and seat flown   will rise 4 3 percent this year versus 1 7 percent in 2017  IATA forecasts  In the highest profile example of the pressures  budget carrier Ryanair  I RYA  was compelled last year by pilot shortages to cancel thousands of flights  and in December recognized trade unions for the first time  The battle that forced Ryanair s hand could put wage pressures on other European budget carriers such as Wizz  L WIZZ   industry experts say   The bigger carriers feel it too  At Air France  PA AIRF   10 unions representing pilots  cabin and ground staff have called for a strike on Feb  22 to push a demand for a 6 percent pay rise   After three years of strong profitability improvements in the sector  we believe personnel and suppliers are asking for wage price increases and thus keeping non fuel costs under control will remain a challenge for the sector   Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Ruxandra Haradau Doser wrote  The wage issue has even extended to the United Arab Emirates  the Middle East trade and financial hub where labor disputes are rare and unions and industrial action are banned  The region s largest airline  Dubai based Emirates  is facing calls from cabin crew to improve conditions and benefits  Employees say management is considering their requests  Last week  brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux cut its rating on German flagship carrier Lufthansa  DE LHAG    already on its lists of stocks to avoid and least preferred in the sector   to  reduce  from  hold   In the United States  investors are worried that the three largest carriers   American  O AAL   Delta  N DAL  and United  N UAL    are heading for a price war just as higher costs from pay increases agreed last year start to bite  CONSOLIDATION  Lufthansa  British Airways parent IAG  L ICAG  and Air France KLM are all expected to report improved 2017 profits when they publish results over the next few weeks  All airlines will need to look at areas where they can save  however   The most successful airline managements are the ones that have been very cost focused every day   not just on staff costs but on aircraft costs  airport charges  distribution costs and so on   said aviation consultant John Strickland  The success of Ryanair  which boasts of having the lowest costs in Europe  is partly down to hard negotiating with manufacturers and airports to get good deals on orders and fees  those in the industry say   Strickland said that while pilot costs would rise  Ryanair was unique in having much lower overall costs than rivals   If they can continue to keep other items such as airport and aircraft costs down  then they will still be in a very strong position    Lufthansa has been taking a tougher stance lately both with staff and airports  Unlike in previous negotiations for its main brand in Germany  Lufthansa stayed firm during a series of pilot strikes from 2014 to 2016 and has now struck a deal to cut its cockpit staff costs by 15 percent  while an increase in ground staff s wages will be partly linked to company profits  Last year  it also put pressure on Frankfurt Airport operator  Fraport   DE FRAG  by moving planes to Munich  It predicts unit costs will fall by 1 2 percent this year  Analysts at  Barclays   LON BARC  say while such measures should help Lufthansa  the rate of improvement is not sustainable and progress still needs to be made at budget unit Eurowings  which earns less than half the margin of its nearest peer   There is a significant amount more work for the company to do on its cost base   they wrote in a note   Along with strong travel demand thanks to robust economies and low oil prices last year  European airlines have also benefited from some consolidation following the insolvencies of Air Berlin and Monarch  which helped lead to higher ticket prices  In addition  many European carriers hedged on jet fuel   unlike their U S  counterparts who got burned making the wrong bets when the oil price starting tumbling in mid 2014   meaning the impact of higher fuel prices will come through for European airlines later than U S  ones   EasyJet s  revenue per seat rose 6 6 percent at constant currencies in the quarter to end December  the no frills airline said  citing the struggles of rivals including Air Berlin  Monarch  Ryanair and Alitalia  It forecast a rise of 5 9 percent for the six months to March

194640,416156,UAL,U S  flight crews ill equipped for sexual harassment complaints,news,By Alana Wise and Jonathan Allen NEW YORK  Reuters    Many U S  flight attendants lack the training in how to deal with complaints of on board sexual harassment  an industry union and Democratic lawmakers say  raising questions about whether airlines are prepared to protect passengers from predatory men   The issue was thrust into the spotlight this week when Alaska Airlines  N ALK  promised to investigate a complaint by Randi Zuckerberg  a Silicon Valley executive and sister of  Facebook Inc   O FB  CEO Mark Zuckerberg  that a male passenger seated near her made lewd sexual remarks to her  Reuters could not independently verify Zuckerberg s allegation  Alaska Airlines did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Friday  Zuckerberg s complaint comes at a moment of reckoning in the United States over sexual harassment  with nearly daily headlines about rich and powerful men in entertainment  politics and media being felled by complaints of impropriety or worse   The Association of Flight Attendants  AFA   which represents employees of Alaska Airlines and several other carriers  said some airlines have guidelines specific to dealing with accusations of passenger on passenger sexual misconduct  But those policies are rarely highlighted and staff are often unaware of any specific guidance  it said  Last year  at the request of the U S  Congress  the group surveyed its members on their awareness of guidelines for dealing with accusations of sexual harassment and assault and found that more than half of the nearly 2 000 respondents had no knowledge of any specific policies    This is different than if someone punches you in the face   AFA spokeswoman Taylor Garland said   There can be shame associated with it  It s just a very unique crime   Democratic lawmakers in the Republican controlled U S  Senate have complained for more than a year about a lack of guidance given to airlines and their flight crews on how to deal with sexual harassment  Senators Bob Casey and Patty Murray  among others  wrote to the U S  Department of Justice and the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  in October last year urging them to do more to track incidents and to strengthen federal rules and guidelines  They also introduced a bill this year mandating better tracking and clearer rules  but it has not become law   It s clear this Congress needs to act sooner rather than later to truly address this issue and make sure survivors get the support and help they deserve   Murray said in a statement on Friday   GRAY AREA A committee on in flight sexual assault formed earlier this year by the U S  Justice Department met as recently as June  the FAA said  but declined to give details of any proposed guidelines  While airlines did not provide a number of complaints  the problem of onboard sexual misconduct is not new  even if its frequency is not well tracked  There have been a handful of successful prosecutions in recent years against people caught sexually harassing other passengers  but they typically involve physical contact   In 2015  a Catholic priest who groped a sleeping woman on a U S  Airways flight was sentenced to six months in federal prison after being convicted of abusive sexual contact  In 2016  a woman told the New York Times that President Donald Trump had groped her during a flight to New York around 1980  when she was 38  Trump denied the woman s claims  telling the newspaper  none of this ever took place   The policy for any potential criminal behavior onboard a flight  including acts of alleged sexual misconduct  is to reach out to law enforcement officers  who will meet the plane at the gate upon landing to investigate the incident   Airlines have different policies and training in place to deal with passenger disruptions   United Airlines  N UAL  said it encourages customers to report incidents of harassment to crew  American Airlines  O AAL  said its staff are trained to deal with all matters of passenger disruptions the same way  including separating involved passengers  and depending on severity  possibly diverting the flight to a different airport to summon law enforcement  The FBI said there was an increase in reports of sexual assault on aircraft in 2016  when it opened at least 58 investigations  compared with 40 in 2015  the New York Times reported  The bureau did not respond to requests for more recent data  Verbal sexual harassment as described in Zuckerberg s complaint falls into a legal gray area  said John Banzhaf  a public interest law professor at George Washington University  Even so  public opinion  not legal statutes  may shape how airlines respond to the alleged incident  In April  United faced international backlash after a video surfaced of a 69 year old passenger being forcibly removed from a parked plane to make room for additional flight crew  Afterwards  some airlines changed their policy on overbooking  But policing speech  even if it is highly offensive  may be more tricky  Banzhaf said    The law basically starts off with the premise that simply saying nasty things  propositioning women and so on by itself is not even a civil tort  much less is it a criminal action   he said in a telephone interview   But Thomas Demetrio  who represented the passenger removed from the United flight  questions whether  in the Zuckerberg incident   Alaska Air  staff erred in providing more alcoholic drinks to the man she said was harassing her  according to her account   They owe Ms  Zuckerberg the highest duty of care and that includes protecting her from an unruly seat mate   Demetrio said in a telephone interview   It s no different than any restaurant or bar  They re supposed to know when to cut a guy off

194699,416215,UAL,U S  airlines affirm aviation emissions deal after Trump s Paris pullout,news,"By Allison Lampert and Victoria Bryan
MONTREAL CANCUN  Reuters    U S  airlines on Tuesday affirmed their support for a plan to curb emissions from flights  under review by the administration of President Donald Trump who recently decided to take the country out of Paris climate change accord 
Several U S  airlines and industry groups said they back the global aviation agreement approved by 70 countries  including the United States  to curb greenhouse gases from international flights 
Trump said on Thursday the United States would withdraw from the landmark 2015 Paris pact to fight climate change  raising questions about whether he would also seek to back out of the 2021 voluntary phase of the airlines agreement 
Air Transport Action Group told reporters at an industry gathering in Cancun  Mexico  on Tuesday that the deal was less costly for carriers than navigating around multiple regional or national rules 
Airlines for America  the trade group for major U S  carriers  said in response to queries from Reuters that it remained committed to the agreement brokered by the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  
At the Mexico event this week  the International Air Transport Association  IATA  and carriers like American Airlines  O AAL  and United Airlines  N UAL  reiterated their support for the deal 
A U S  State Department spokeswoman said in an email that the aviation agreement was under review  as were all regulatory policies agreed by the Obama administration  There is no deadline for action  she said 
Under the global deal  airlines will buy carbon credits from environmental projects around the world to offset growth in emissions from international commercial flights 
The deal  known as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation  has a voluntary phase starting in 2021 and that would become mandatory  Without the pact  airlines would be charged for emissions by regions like Europe 
 We believe having a series of national or regional measures overlapping and contradicting each other increases costs  administration  complexity   said Michael Gill  executive director of the Air Transport Action Group 
 Having a single global approach brings significant financial and operational benefits   he told reporters in Cancun 
Citing ICAO figures  he said the industry estimates the deal will cost airlines to  1 5 billion to  6 2 billion in 2025  depending on future carbon prices  and no more than 1 8 percent of industry revenues by 2035 
According to ICAO  airlines from 70 States  which account for almost 88 percent of international flights  will be covered by the deal 
Russia and India have said they would not participate in the voluntary phase from 2021 to 2026 ",2017-06-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-airlines-affirm-aviation-emissions-deal-after-trump's-paris-pullout-492577,492577

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  4 Top Ranked Airline Stocks that Could Fly Higher in 2019The airline industry has struggled for the most part of 2018  thanks to rising oil prices  With fuel comprising a major chunk of the airline expenditure  an upswing in crude oil prices certainly does not bode well for the industry  Apart from escalating fuel prices  high labor costs have weighed on bottom line growth of individual companies  The airline employees  agitation against low pay scales has propelled frequent new labor deals across the industry However  this adversity was partly offset by strong demand for air travel  leading to higher passenger revenues and in turn  boosting the top line  Evidently  the top line of a majority of the carriers has shown a year over year improvement in the first nine months of 2018  To name a couple  United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines have shown top line improvements of 8 7  and 9   respectively The TurnaroundThe prime factor behind the airline industry s recovery can be attributed to the downward trend in oil prices since mid October  To add to it  the oil price retreat coincided with the record setting thanksgiving travel period  Backed by such an upbeat scenario  several major U S  carriers have provided bullish fourth quarter projections  Alaska Air Group anticipates fourth quarter revenue per available seat mile in the range of 12 70 12 80 cents compared with the previous guidance of 12 60 12 80 cents  The revised estimate represents a year over year change of 4 5   Notably  the carrier raised its unit revenue outlook twice within a few weeks  span Meanwhile  Spirit Airlines predicts the same to rise approximately 11   past view had called for an approximate 6  increase   Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  have also lowered forecasts for fuel cost in the final quarter of 2018  While Southwest Airlines expects fuel costs between  2 25 and  2 30 per gallon  earlier view was in the  2 30  2 35 band   Spirit Airlines estimates economic fuel cost to be  2 27 per gallon compared with  2 46 envisioned earlier Despite chances of oil prices rising again in 2019 and a global economic slowdown  the International Air Transport Association  IATA  has provided a positive outlook for the industry  The research firm predicts global net profit of  35 5 billion in

194721,416237,UAL,Owners of dead giant rabbit on United flight seek damages  probe,news,"By Dan Whitcomb
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    The owners of a giant rabbit named Simon who was found dead after a United Airlines flight demanded on Monday that the airline pay damages  order an outside investigation and re evaluate how it handles animals on flights 
Attorneys for Simon s owners  who purchased him in hopes of winning the title of world s largest rabbit at the Iowa State Fair this summer  said they would take legal action if United failed to respond within seven days 
The lawyers say it is possible the 3 foot long  1 meter  hare died after being placed in a freezer for 16 hours upon landing in Chicago on a flight from London  They say the airline then destroyed his remains without permission 
 United Airlines can issue any statement they like but their company s credibility is under question when they immediately cremate the giant rabbit Simon without anyone s consent   said Guy Cook  lead attorney for the three person investment group that owned the rabbit   They destroyed the proof  
United Airlines  UAL N  spokesman Charles Hobart denied Simon died in a freezer  He said in a written statement the company was reviewing a letter outlining the claims  was saddened by Simon s death and takes its responsibilities for transporting pets seriously  The statement did not say how much the owners were seeking in damages 
Hobart said the hare arrived in Chicago in apparent good condition and was seen moving around his kennel some 35 minutes later 
 Shortly thereafter  a kennel representative noticed Simon was motionless and that he had passed away   Hobart said  He did not address the cremation allegations 
Cook said it would be difficult to establish a cause of death because the rabbit s remains had been destroyed but  in the letter  demanded that United turn over all records of its investigation  including closed circuit television footage 
The attorney also requested an independent investigation as well as compensatory and economic and punitive damages 
Cook said that Simon  a Continental rabbit whose father is considered the world s largest hare  was expected to exceed his father s size to claim that title and that his owners should be compensated for their potential economic losses from exhibiting him 
The investment group purchased Simon from a breeder in England and was flying him to the United States  where he would have been displayed at the Iowa State Fair in August and ultimately crowned world s largest rabbit  Cook said ",2017-05-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/owners-of-dead-giant-rabbit-on-united-flight-seek-damages,-probe-481432",481432

YTD Price Performance

Reasons Behind the Lackluster Price Performance
High fuel costs have been the primary reason behind the company s dismal performance In fact  oil prices have increased roughly 10  on a year to date basis 
In the second quarter  high fuel costs are expected to limit bottom line growth at American Airlines as was the case in first quarter 2018  Average fuel price per gallon rose 23 6  year over year to  2 10 per gallon in the first quarter  Fuel prices are anticipated to be even higher  between  2 18 and  2 23 per gallon  in the second quarter 
Apart from high fuel costs  expenses pertaining to labor are expected to weigh on the bottom line in the second quarter  Consolidated cost per available seat miles  excluding special items and fuel  is anticipated to increase 3 5  in the second quarter of 2018 
American Airlines  high debt levels are added concerns  Apart from American Airlines  the rise in oil prices has also hurt other airline operators like Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   
Other Unfavorable Readings
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter and full year 2018 earnings moved south 8 5  and 7 9   respectively  in the last 60 days  This reflects investor s pessimism surrounding the stock  
Furthermore  the company s  of D highlights its short term unattractiveness  Undoubtedly  the above negatives substantiate the company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell

194771,416287,UAL,American Air lowers key revenue guidance  sending shares down,news,"By Alana Wise NEW YORK  Reuters     American Airlines Group  Inc  O AAL  on Thursday became the second major U S  airline this week to lower guidance on a closely watched revenue metric  sending shares of several major carriers lower  However  analysts said the forecasts for lower unit revenue at American and Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  had different causes  and were not a sign that the air travel market is hitting an unforeseen slump   American shares were down 3 48 percent at  43 33 at market close  while Delta and Southwest Airlines Co  N LUV  fell less than 1 percent and United Continental Holdings Inc  N UAL  closed down 1 2 percent on a day when U S  stocks gained slightly    Things are improving  but at a slower rate than airlines had hoped for   CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore said  blaming recent market dips on the slow trickle of reports on carriers  performance   American said on Thursday morning before market opening its unit revenue would rise 1 5 percent to 3 5 percent  cutting an earlier projection that total revenue per available seat mile would rise 2 5 percent to 4 5 percent   It s still trending positive   Revenue per available seat mile  is still rising  and that s the break from the negative trends we need to see   Corridore said  Share prices sectorwide also slipped on Monday following Delta s trimmed outlook  American said its unit revenue fell mainly because it canceled fewer flights last month than it did the year before  The company said it completed 98 9 percent of its mainline flights last month  compared with 97 7 percent in the same period last year   American s improved completion factor  the percentage of an airline s flights that were completed without cancellation  while good for customers  ultimately put a drag on the company s expected unit revenue rise  American said   Delta  for its lowered guidance  cited a  more moderate pace of improvement in February    
U S  carriers have struggled to mark positive increases in unit revenue  which measures sales relative to flight capacity  as cheaper fares and tougher competition have pummeled the industry  A positive increase in the metric would break a two year streak of flat to negative change  In the same statement  American reported February 2017 total revenue passenger miles fell 3 3 percent from a year earlier to 15 2 billion  The airline said its total capacity fell 3 7 percent to 19 6 billion available seat miles in the same period ",2017-03-09,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/american-air-lowers-key-revenue-guidance,-sending-shares-down-465090",465090
194772,416288,UAL,Air Tickets Get Cheaper In April Despite High Fuel Costs ,opinion,"Although fuel costs have been increasing  air fares in the United States declined in April according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Per the report  ticket prices decreased 2 7  on a month on month basis  making it the sharpest fall in four years 
Moreover  in April  average air fares  unadjusted  fell 6 9  from the comparable figure a year ago  Notably  the April reading comes after two successive months of increase in airfares  Even though  low air fares spell good news for fliers  it is likely to hurt the top line of airline companies 
Excessive Competition Pressurize Air Fares
The decline in airfares has been attributed to the intense competition in key markets  In fact  the low cost carrier  Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    had cited the competitive fare scenario as a reason for its disappointing first quarter unit revenues 
Moreover  the significant growth of low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines  Inc    NYSE SAVE   and Southwest Airlines has not gone unnoticed by legacy carriers including American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL    Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   
In a bid to combat the threat of low cost carriers and attract budget conscious travelers  both the above mentioned legacy carriers have been selling cheaper tickets  Basic Economy Fares  for quite some time  In a price conscious economy  it is not just the survival of the fittest  but of the cheapest  Keeping this in mind  big airline players are now looking to attract budget friendly travelers 
Capacity Overexpansion
Capacity overexpansion may lead to oversupply in the market and is one of the significant factors behind suppressed air fares  Fears that airline capacity would grow at a rate higher than the U S  GDP  thereby resulting in an oversupplied market  have been one of the main challenges in the airline space 
Moreover  the April traffic reports of most carriers  including the likes of Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    Southwest Airlines  United Continental and Hawaiian Airlines  the subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HA    have revealed that capacity expanded at a higher pace than traffic  Consequently  load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  declined in the month at the above mentioned carriers 
Airfares to Increase in Future 
Despite the significant decline in April airfares  we expect ticket prices to go up in the coming months  The obvious reason is the upsurge in expenses on fuel  Oil prices had increased 5 6  in April  U S  President Donald Trump s decision to withdraw from a nuclear deal with OPEC member Iran has further boosted oil prices 
Currently  oil prices are hovering at around  71 a barrel  It is a well documented fact that the health of airline stocks is inversely related to oil prices  This is because fuel costs represent one of the most significant expenses for carriers  Evidently  the rise in oil prices induces significant increase in operating expenses of carriers  thus limiting bottom line growth 
In fact  the first quarter earnings season  which is over for airlines  witnessed many stocks in the space suffering due to rise in fuel costs  Notably  oil prices were up approximately 8  in the January to March period 
In a bid to counter the challenges posed by surging oil prices  airlines are likely to increase air fares  Also  American Airlines  CEO  Doug Parker  has hinted at higher ticket prices  
Conclusion
Given the present scenario related to the increase in one of the largest input costs of airlines  we believe that the drop in April ticket prices is an isolated event  In the coming months  air travel in the country is expected to get more expensive as airlines look to pass on the increased costs to consumers  so that their profits are not dented Whatever be the actual outcome  we anticipate investor focus to remain on this burning issue of air ticket prices  going forward

194773,416289,UAL,What Does Southwest s  LUV  Dividend Hike Mean For Airlines ,opinion,"Last week  Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV       one of leading players in the airline space   announced a 28  hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 16 cents per share  annualized 64 cents per share   The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Jun 27  2018 to shareholders of record as of Jun 6 
This latest move highlights Southwest Airlines  commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects  going forward  Moreover  a look at past records reveals Southwest Airlines  stable dividend payment history  Notably  this marks the low cost carrier s 167th straight quarter of dividend payment 
Shareholder Friendly Measures Highlight Strong Balance Sheets
Apart from Southwest Airlines  its fellow airline companies like SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   and Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK   have raised their dividend payouts this year  Moreover  Hawaiian Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ HA    the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines  started paying dividends from October  2017 
Southwest Airlines  board of directors also cleared a new share buyback program worth  2 billion  The new program is set to begin on completion of the existing  2 billion share repurchase authorized in May 2017 
These investor friendly measures clearly highlight the financial prosperity of stocks in the airline space  The strong balance sheets of sector participants have made them invest substantially for promoting safety and enhancing productivity 
While Alaska Air Group carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   SkyWest has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Uptick in Shareholder Friendly Activities Likely
With the advent of the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   the financial health of airline players is likely to improve further  This is because  more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others due to the significant reduction in tax bills 
Consequently  an increase in the shareholder friendly measures  dividends  buybacks  is very much in the cards for the airline space  For example  we expect Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   to hike its dividend shortly  This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks 
As investors prefer an income generating stock  a high dividend paying one is much coveted  Needless to say  investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track record with respect to dividends buybacks 
Solid Demand for Air Travel Bodes Well with Approaching Summer 
Airlines  robust financial health has allowed them to make investments for improving onboard experience  Strong demand has also prompted airlines to add routes  For example  United Airlines   the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL     recently added routes from New York Newark and Washington Dulles 
Given higher demand for travel from New York  the carrier aims to attract traffic on the routes  Improvement in domestic economy has contributed to the upside  With consumer confidence remaining upbeat  more and more Americans are taking vacations 
With demand remaining strong  we expect airlines to rake in significant profits in the upcoming summer season despite the rise in oil prices  Summers usually represent a very busy time for airlines and this year is likely to be no different  In fact  despite high fuel costs air fares had  in April  according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Valuation Attractive Despite High Fuel Costs
Going by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio   which is often used to value airline stocks   given their significant debt levels  and high depreciation and amortization expenses  the industry does not look expensive at this point 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 6 2  the lowest point in the last six months   which compares favorably with the market at large as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is at 11 2  The industry s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside

194817,416333,UAL,U S  tells consumers to stop using fire prone Samsung phones,news,"By Se Young Lee and Jeffrey Dastin
SEOUL NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  government safety agency on Friday urged all consumers to stop using Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones  which are prone to catch fire  and top airlines globally banned their use during flights 
Following reports that the phones  batteries have combusted during charging and normal use  the U S  Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was working on an official recall of the devices and that users should turn them off in the meantime 
 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930  said it was working with the agency and asked customers to immediately turn in their Note 7 phones  It voluntarily issued a recall last week for 10 markets  including South Korea and the United States  and it said it was expediting shipments of replacement phones to customers in the United States 
The U S  government action heralds more fallout for the South Korean manufacturer  which may take a financial hit from the recall and lose customers who are concerned about the quality of its flagship phones 
Some analysts say the recall could cost Samsung nearly  5 billion in revenue  after accounting for expenses from the recall process 
For Samsung  which prides itself on manufacturing prowess  the scale of the recall is expected to be unprecedented  Some 2 5 million of the premium devices have been sold worldwide  the company has said  Its shares closed down 3 9 percent on Friday 
Samsung said users in the United States can exchange their phones for one of several models and receive a  25 gift card 
In a separate statement on Saturday  Samsung asked consumers in South Korea to discontinue the use of their Galaxy Note 7 phones and visit one of the company s service centers for the recall process 
 The cost of the recall is going to be astronomical   said product liability expert and chief executive officer of Real World Forensic Engineering  Jahan Rasty 
 They have to compensate people  fix the problem and give them a revised version of the product that doesn t have the same manufacturing or design defect 
 The longer this story lingers  the more it will etch itself in people s minds   he said 
AIRLINE BANS
One pain point is that the devices are now off limits in a typically high use setting  aboard planes 
Aviation authorities and airlines from North America to Europe and Asia have issued bans or guidance on the phones  On Thursday  the U S  Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  said travelers should not use or charge them while in the air  or stow them in checked luggage 
South Korea made similar recommendations on Saturday 
The FAA s action prompted the world s three largest airlines by passenger traffic   American  O AAL   Delta  N DAL  and United  N UAL    to start telling passengers at the gate and on board aircraft to keep the phones switched off until they deplane 
While experts say the bans may be tough for airlines to enforce  they nonetheless may deter would be customers of the Note 7 in addition to annoying existing customers 
That s because airlines have increasingly made movies and TV shows available free for streaming on smart devices in flight  to avoid the cost of installing new screens on seat backs  For now  Note 7 customers are cut off from this entertainment 
This is  a huge black eye for Samsung   TECHnalysis Research President Bob O Donnell said 
Companies ranging from Singapore Airlines Ltd  SI SIAL  and Qantas Airways Ltd  AX QAN  to Air France KLM SA  PA AIRF  have instituted similar bans on the device 
They are the latest in ongoing efforts in the airline industry to manage the use of lithium ion batteries  which are known to combust and are used in many devices  from phones and laptops to toys 
Top airlines banned hoverboards during the Christmas holiday season in 2015  Earlier this year  the U N  s aviation agency prohibited shipments of lithium ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes 
A January report from the FAA said at least 171 incidents of smoke  fire  extreme heat or explosion involving batteries have occurred since 1991 
In some instances  they have caused emergency landings  as when a camera short circuited and started a small fire in the overhead bin of an American Airlines flight in September 2013  Injuries were rare  the report said ",2016-09-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/u.s.-tells-consumers-to-stop-using-fire-prone-samsung-phones-425385,425385

194830,416346,UAL,Fly Higher In 2018 With These 5 Terrific Airline Stocks,opinion,On Feb 26  billionaire investor  Warren Buffett  continued to display his affinity for airline stocks  In an interview to CNBC  the  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company  thereby displaying his recent interest in the space once again Last year  the U S  airline suffered significant losses due to a plethora of headwinds like back to back hurricanes and higher fuel costs  However  the industry recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year  The resurgence of airline stocks is evident from the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 11 1  over the last 60 days Persistent demand for air travel outpacing the overall economic growth and the latest trend of airline operators adding capacity are likely to keep the momentum high in 2018 Growth Induced PolicesPresident Donald Trump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35  to 21  is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years  A large part of airline operators book much of their revenues within the United States  Consequently  a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by airliners would be immediately accretive to cash flow Bullish IATA Forecast for 2018In December 2017  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   provided an encouraging outlook for the global airline industry  IATA predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry in 2018  This is much higher than the profitability forecast of  34 5 billion for 2017  This bright projection can be attributed to strong demand for air travel Global net profit margin is expected to improve marginally to 4 7  in 2018 from 4 6  estimated in 2017  The top line is projected at  824 billion in 2018 compared with  754 billion expected for 2017 Optimism surrounding the air cargo business also improved  Cargo revenues are forecasted to increase to  59 2 billion in 2018  estimated revenues for 2017 are  54 5 billion   Per the forecast  air travel growth of 6  is expected for 2018  The estimated figure for 2018 is above the average growth of 5 5  in the last 10 20 years Moody s Maintain Stable 2018 OutlookIn December 2017  Moody s Investors Services maintains 2018 outlook for the global airline industry as stable  This stable outlook is driven by projections for 8 5  to 10  operating margins for Moody s rated airlines through 2019  with U S  carriers remaining the most profitable  Moody s projects industry revenues to grow about 4   offsetting higher labor and fuel costs  Steady global economic growth will support rising demand for air travel over the next 12 to 18 months Our Top PicksThe Transportation Services industry is currently in a strong position from the  perspective  The  is currently in the top 40   102 out of 256  of the Zacks Categorized industries

194831,416347,UAL,Load Factors Improve In February  Good News For Airlines  ,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that woes related to capacity overexpansion had plagued stocks in the airline space for quite some time  In this context  we note that United Continental Holdings  Inc  s   NYSE UAL   shares had declined significantly in January 2018  even after reporting better than expected results in the fourth quarter due to its commentary related to capacity expansion 
United Continental carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
In such a scenario  investors fear that capacity expansion might lead to oversupply in the market even as oil prices are well below the highs touched in 2014  Low ticket prices in the United States also hint at the capacity overexpansion issue  While low air fares attract fliers  it dents profits for carriers 
February Traffic Reports Offer a Glimmer of Hope
Despite the above mentioned headwinds  February traffic reports of most carriers seem to be encouraging  thus hinting at a decline in capacity related woes in the airline space  This is because load factor    of seats filled by passengers  has decreased at each of the above mentioned carriers as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion in the month 
At Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    load factor improved 40 basis points year over year to 81 5  in February  with traffic increasing 3 8  and capacity expanding 3 4   Higher traffic growth in the same month also led to 200 basis points  340 basis points  140 basis points and 190 basis points increase in load factor at Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV    GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S A    NYSE GOL    United Continental and Hawaiian Holdings  Inc  s   NASDAQ HA   subsidiary   Hawaiian Airlines  respectively 
In fact  Southwest s load factor expansion to 81  is a record figure for February 
Price Performance in February
In view of the favorable load factor readings  it is of little wonder that the  outperformed the broader market in February  While the S P 500 Index gained 3 7   the industry rallied 4 8  

The impressive February traffic reports are likely to keep the long standing capacity related fears at bay  at least for now  Let s take a look at some of the other factors which highlight the attractiveness of the sector 
Impressive Unit Revenue Projections 
For the first quarter of 2018  unit revenue views are impressive  highlighting the solid demand for air travel  For example  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   expects total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  growth between 2  and 4   Meanwhile  United Continental envisions consolidated passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2  year over year 
Delta anticipates total unit revenues  excluding refinery sales  to increase in the band of 2 5 4 5   on a year over year basis  for the current quarter  In fact  the company expects to perform well on this front throughout 2018  with passenger unit revenue growth estimated in each quarter 
Dividends Buybacks Bode Well
The likes of Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK   and SkyWest  Inc  have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018  We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  
Notably  huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others  This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks

United 
In a SEC filing that was made public today  United announced that it expects to post adjusted earnings between  6 50 per share and  8 50 per share in fiscal 2018  Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for the company to post earnings of  7 50 per share  which falls directly in the middle of United s latest guidance and would mark a 10 95  year over year surge 
Investors might be happy to the note that the airline s new high side EPS guidance comes in  0 46 above our current highest earnings estimate  This might signal that some optimistic analysts will soon up their estimates based on United s new EPS projections 
The company also provided initial 2020 earnings guidance and noted that its CAGR target for EPS is 25   United projects it will post an EPS figure between  11 and  13 in 2020  based on this three year growth target 
Along with these more long term projections  United upped its Q1 fiscal 2018 passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  guidance from between 0  and 2  to 1  and 3   This important metric is one that airline industry investors pay close attention to as it is a solid way to measure efficiency and profitability

Furthermore  American s bottom line is projected to expand at an annualized rate of nearly 17  over the next three to five years  which is strong for a company of its size and age  These estimates could climb even higher if recent American initiatives  such as its new  Basic Economy  options on some trans Atlantic flights  prove to be solid revenue drivers

During the opening quarter of Fiscal Year 2016  United reported earnings of  313 million or 0 88 per share  down sharply from net profits of  508 million or 1 32 per share over the same period a year earlier  The Chicago based airlines company  however  blamed the significant decline on a comparatively high annual tax burden from the previous year  In last year s opening quarter  United lowered its effective tax rate to 0 5   due primarily to an existing income tax valuation against its deferred income tax assets  By comparison  the company s effective tax rate last quarter rose to 36 6   representing a combination of federal  state and foreign taxes 
As a result  United finished the three month period in late March with pre tax earnings of  688 million  up considerably from  600 million a year earlier  The figure represents United s highest first quarter in terms of pre tax earnings ever  While the company topped analysts  forecasts with adjusted earnings of  435 million or 1 23 per share  its revenues still plunged by 4 8  to  8 2 billion 
 I am extremely proud of United s nearly 86 000 aviation professionals for their contributions to these strong results   including the improvements in our reliability  customer satisfaction and financial performance   said Oscar Munoz  president and chief executive officer of United Airlines   As we accelerate United s path forward  we will continue to focus on running a great airline today while innovating for tomorrow  
In addition  United settled a potential proxy fight with a pair of activist investors when it named Barney Harford  the former CEO of Orbitz Worldwide and Ed Shapiro  managing director of PAR Capital Management  to its Board of Directors  As part of the settlement  United also agreed to name former Air Canada CEO Robert Milton as its nonexecutive chairman at the company s annual meeting later this year 
Moving forward  United lowered its forward guidance for the current quarter by reducing a key industry metric following a series of weak bookings in April  For the quarter  United expected that its Revenue Per Passenger Per Miles Flown metric will decline by 6 5 to 8 5

2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Airlines  including Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   Industry  Airlines  Part 2Link  Airline stocks have rebounded nicely after struggling for most of 2017  Headwinds ranging from flight cancellations and the resultant loss of revenues due to hurricanes and other calamities  high costs and customer dissatisfaction contributed to the sector s struggles in the year gone by However  things are looking up for stocks in the space post hurricanes  The fact that the overall picture is brightening up for airlines can be made out from the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased 10 9  over the last three months Impressive Q4 Highlights TurnaroundThe ongoing Q4 reporting cycle has seen major sector participants like Delta Air Lines  American Airlines Group  Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings reporting better than expected earnings per share and revenues Moreover  their performances with respect to unit revenues  a measure of sales relative to capacity for a carrier  have been impressive  More heartening are the projections provided by these key sector participants with respect to this closely watched metric For example  American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat miles  TRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  to increase in the band of 2  to 4  in the first quarter of 2018  Southwest Airlines expects first quarter revenue per available seat mile  RASM  to rise between 1  and 2  Non Fuel Unit Costs Likely to Hurt Less Going ForwardApart from bullish unit revenues  the bottom lines of carriers are likely to be less severely impacted by non fuel unit costs going forward  This is evident from the improved outlook provided by the key sector players with respect to cost per available seat miles  excluding fuel  For example  Southwest Airlines expects unit costs  excluding fuel and oil expense  profit sharing and special items  to grow in the band of 0 5 1 5  in the first quarter of 2018  The projection is favorable compared with the 4 1  rise in the metric in the fourth quarter  American Airlines expects unit costs  excluding fuel and special items  to increase 2  year over year in 2018  which again is better than the reading in the fourth quarter of 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to Boost AirlinesAirlines are expected to get a significant boost from the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   The optimism can be made out from the fact that the likes of American Airlines  Southwest Airlines  Alaska Air Group and others declared bonuses following the tax reform American Airlines stated on its fourth quarter conference call that it expects to receive cash tax refunds to the tune of approximately  170 million in both 2019 and 2020 pertaining to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax Moreover  in the new tax scenario  companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately  which was not allowed earlier  This provision will benefit airlines hugely as they spend extensively on this front Furthermore  the huge savings due to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others  This means good news for shareholders too as dividend hikes and more buybacks are likely going forward Improving Domestic Economy Bodes WellWith the domestic economy on a solid footing

194871,416387,UAL,Is United Continental  UAL  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  United Continental has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  the current level stands way below the highs for the stock  indicating that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that United Continental has forward PE of 11 5x  so it is fair to expect a slight increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  United Continental has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  United Continental currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes United Continental a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 2  which is far better than the industry average of 6 2  Clearly  UAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall While United Continental might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives UAL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen NINE estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has also seen nine up and none down in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has increased nearly 4 9  in the past one month  while the next year estimate has moved up by 8 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below United Continental Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus   Even though the company has better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineUnited Continental is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  The stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 37   indicating that broader factors are favorable for the company  Further  over the past three months  its industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re

194885,416401,UAL,U S  DOJ files suit against United to thwart Newark take off slot deal,news,"Investing com    The U S  Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit on Tuesday against United Continental Holdings Inc  N UAL  in an attempt to scuttle the airline carrier s acquisition of two dozen take off and landing slots from Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  at Newark Liberty International Airport earlier last month  
The Justice Department s Antitrust Division  in a lawsuit filed in the U S  District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark  alleged that United s proposed acquisition of 24 Delta slots could enhance the airliner s already dominant position at the airport and provides another competition barrier for rival companies looking to expand travel options for customers in the New York New Jersey metropolitan area  The resulting transaction could provide the airport s 35 million annual travelers with higher ticket prices and fewer options  according to the Justice Department  
United currently controls 902 of the 1 244 or 73  of the slots allocated to commercial airlines companies at Newark Airport by the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA   None of United s closest competitors control more than 100 of the landing or take off slots at one of the nation s busiest airports  In addition  United grounds as many as 82 flights per day  according to the complaint  in effect depriving customers of other flight options that could be available if the slots were owned by other airlines companies  
 A slot is essentially a license to compete at Newark   said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Justice Department s Antitrust Division    United already holds most of them  and as a result  competition at Newark is in critically short supply   United is already extracting a  Newark premium    Airfares at Newark are among the highest in the country while United s service at Newark ranks among the worst   Allowing United to acquire even more slots at Newark would fortify United s monopoly position  and weaken rivals  ability to challenge that dominance  leaving consumers to pay the price  
For instance  the Justice Department outlined significant decreases in the cost of airline prices in five travel routes out of Newark last year after Southwest acquired 36 slots from United  The transaction resulted in a 27  decline in prices for flights from Newark to St  Louis and a 17  reduction in prices for flights from Newark to Houston  
Last month in what essentially amounts to a slot swap  United assumed control of Newark slots formerly owned by Delta in exchange for handing over slots at John F  Kennedy International airport  The  14 million sale took place following United s decision to move cross country flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco out of JFK and into its Newark hub  
A United spokesman said Tuesday that the company will vigorously defend its ability to operate  efficiently  effectively and competitively   at Newark Airport ",2015-11-10,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-doj-files-suit-against-united-to-thwart-newark-take-off-slot-deal-370687,370687

194896,416412,UAL,Airline Stock Roundup  AAL To Strengthen Canadian Footprint  UAL In Focus   More,opinion,"The Thanksgiving holiday period hasn t been very eventful for the airline space  However  a few developments concerning big names like American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   are worth a mention 
In line with the efforts to expand its presence  American Airlines announced its intentions to start operating additional flights to Canada  Also  United Continental s subsidiary   United Airlines   stated that it performed exceeding well in the Thanksgiving travel week  with respect to many key metrics like on time performance 
Meanwhile  the long standing dispute between U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts got uglier with Etihad reportedly voicing concerns over a provision in the Senate s tax reform bill  According to the provision  certain foreign carriers including the likes of Etihad would have to pay U S  corporate tax under certain conditions 
We note that major U S  carriers like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    American Airlines and United Continental had complained to the U S  administration that the massive subsidies and other benefits enjoyed by the three state owned carriers   Qatar Airways  Etihad and Emirates   are unfair as they deny a level playing field to the carriers in the United States 
Also  according to the Air Travel Consumer Report released by the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT   service related complaints from customers in April 2017 were comparatively more than that in April 2016 and March 2017

Recap of the Past Week s Most Important Stories 
1  On Nov 16  the  1 5 trillion tax reform bill was passed by the House Republicans by a vote of 227 to 205  This further threatens to ignite the dispute between U S  carriers and their Gulf counterparts  A provision  introduced by Johnny Isakson   a senator from Delta s home state Georgia   might hit the pockets of some foreign carriers hard  
According to the proposal  some foreign carriers will have to pay U S  corporate taxes on their income earned in the United States  However  two conditions need to be fulfilled   These include the absence of a reciprocal tax agreement between the United States and the country where the foreign carrier is based and second  less frequent flights from the United States to the concerned nation  less than two weekly departures arrivals by U S  carriers   In the next few days  the tax cut bill will be debated and voted upon by the full Senate 
2  In a bid to expand its operations  American Airlines announced that it intends to add flights to Canada from its hub at Chicago O Hare International Airport  next year  Toward this end  the carrier aims to start operating daily flights to Vancouver from May 4  2018 
Moreover  flights on a seasonal basis to Calgary are expected to be operational from June 7  2018  American Airlines also intends to increase frequencies from the U S  East Coast to Eastern Canada apart from extending seasonal service to popular destinations in Canada  American Airlines carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
3  It hasn t been a successful 2017 for United Airlines so far due to various issues like the infamous David Dao incident  But  recently the company has something to cheer for  The carrier performed exceedingly well in the Thanksgiving travel week  Nov 19 to Nov 26  smashing various records  For example  with respect to on time departures the company established a company record of 89 1  on Thanksgiving Day  The next day United Airlines improved the record with the measure rising to 89 8  
4  According to the June Air Travel Consumer Report released by the DOT  the rate of cancelled scheduled domestic flights increased to 1 6  in April 2017 from 0 9  recorded a year ago  The figure  however  compared favorably to the reading of 1 8  in March 2017 
According to the report  78 5  flights operated by U S  carriers  mentioned in the report  arrived on time in April 2017  This represents a deterioration from the comparable figures of 84 5  a year ago and 79 9  in March  Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA   secured the top spot with 88 8  of its flights arriving on time in April  The carrier was followed by United Continental and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK

194898,416414,UAL,Clear Skies Ahead For Airlines  3 Stocks To Scoop Up  ,opinion,"It seems that airline stocks are back in favor after facing multiple challenges for the greater part of 2017  Sector participants have been hampered by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back to back hurricanes  the devastating earthquake in Mexico  issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs  labor as well as fuel  
The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below  The chart clearly indicates that the  had underperformed the S P 500 Index in the above mentioned period  While the S P 500 index gained 11 9   the industry rallied 8 8  
Airlines Laid Low in Q3
It is a well documented fact that airline stocks struggled in the third quarter of 2017 due to the negative impacts of the recent natural calamities  Even though most sector heavyweights like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   topped earnings estimates  the outperformance was primarily owing to the conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
In this context  let s consider the case of American Airlines  In the third quarter  the consensus estimate for the carrier s earnings was pegged at  1 39  much lower than the year ago figure of  1 68  The conservative nature of the Zacks Consensus Estimate has made it easier for transportation companies to surpass them in the quarter 
In fact  higher costs led to a decline in quarterly earnings on a year over year basis for most carriers  thus revealing the sorry state of affairs for the sector  While the bottom line fell 7 6  and 5 4  at Delta and Southwest Airlines  respectively  at United Continental the metric was down 28 6   American Airlines also reported a significant reduction in earnings in the same time frame 
Moreover  multiple flight cancellations and continued soft demand for air travel to and from the affected areas due to the recent natural calamities hurt third quarter results  For example  United Continental s pre tax income was hurt to the tune of approximately  185 million 
Improved Unit Projections Hint at Brighter Q4
Post hurricanes  things are looking up for stocks in the airline space  This is evident from the fact that major players in the sector like Southwest Airlines and United Continental issued improved unit revenue views for the fourth quarter on the back of buoyant demand for air travel and improving yields 
United Continental now expects fourth quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  in the band of down 2  to flat on a year over year basis  The projection compares favorably with the earlier view that the metric might drop in the band of 1  to 3  
Southwest Airlines expects operating revenue per available seat miles  RASM  a key measure of unit revenue  to increase between 1  and 2   earlier view had called for the metric to be up slightly to 1 5    in the final quarter of 2017  Hawaiian Holdings anticipates fourth quarter RASM to improve between 1 5  and 3 5   up from the previous view of down 1  to up 2  
Dividends Buybacks Attest Solid Financial Health
Financial prosperity of the sector participants is reflected in the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines  Delta Air Lines and SkyWest Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year 
Carriers have also indulged in share buybacks that substantiates their solid financial health yet again  For example  United Continental recently announced a new  3 billion share repurchase program  The company s previous  2 billion share repurchase program announced in July 2016 is expected to be completed by 2017 end 
In addition to the existing  100 million authorization  Hawaiian Holdings unveiled a new share repurchase program worth  100 million through Dec 31  2019 
Notably  the robust financial health of most carriers has prompted them to invest substantially in improving flying experience for travellers  in a bid to stay afloat in the competitive airline space 
Bullish Projections
Of late  the bullish projections revealed by the International Air Transport Association   IATA   and Airlines for America  A4A  for 2017 profitability and the upcoming winter holiday season  Dec 15 Jan 4   respectively  further highlights the optimism surrounding the space 
According to A4A  the winter holiday season is expected to be a busy one for U S  carriers  The organization expects 51 million passengers to opt for air travel during the period  reflecting a 3 5  increase from the 2016 figure 
An improving domestic economy and affordable air fares have resulted in the bullish forecast for this year  The rosy projection for the winter holiday period comes close on the heels of the robust performance of U S  carriers in the Thanksgiving holiday period 
Even on the global front  the picture seems to be a bright one for airlines  This is signified by the bullish projection issued by the IATA with respect to the profitability level for 2018  The research firm predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry  This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of  34 5 billion  increased from the  31 4 billion predicted in June   
The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be  8 90 per passenger in 2018 compared with  8 45 in 2017  Additionally  the improved projection for full year 2017 by Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes   NYSE GOL   is indicative of the improving Latin American economy

194911,416427,UAL,United Airlines plans  3 billion buyback  but expects unit revenue drop,news,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Sweta Singh
 Reuters    United Continental Holdings Inc  N UAL  on Thursday forecast a drop in unit revenue and trimmed plans for capacity growth as the U S  dollar weighs on demand abroad  but it announced new share buybacks because its profit continues to rise 
The Chicago based airline said it expects passenger unit revenue to decrease between 5 and 7 percent in the third quarter  Capacity will only grow between 1 and 1 5 percent in 2015 compared to a year earlier  it said  lowering a prior forecast for growth of as much as 2 percent 
Shares rose more than 2 percent in early trade on news of United s plans to buy back  3 billion of its stock  The capacity trim comes as a relief to investors too  who have called on U S  airlines to limit their growth to match weaker demand 
 Management appears concerned about the decline in unit revenue and is being responsive to weaker demand in some markets   Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note  adding that capacity in Brazil  Japan and Scandinavia took some of the largest cuts 
United s outlook reflects the challenging revenue environment that U S  airlines continue to face as the strong dollar lowers foreign travelers  spending power in the United States  Rival Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL  said last week that it expects passenger unit revenue to decline between 4 5 percent and 6 5 percent in the third quarter 
Despite this  United said it expects a pre tax profit margin between 13 5 percent and 15 5 percent in the third quarter  excluding special items 
 The  3 billion share repurchase program we announced today demonstrates the confidence we have in our future   Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smisek said in a news release 
Sterne Agee CRT analyst Adam Hackel said the move  three times larger than United s last buyback plan   signals that the stock is undervalued  and added that United likely will pay out dividends once valuations improve

that stocks in the airline space have been plagued by multiple headwinds like weather related disruptions  pricing issues and high costs  The turbulence in the sector is largely responsible for the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declining 2 5  over the last three months  With Q3 earnings season coming up  the ongoing turbulence may result in airlines performing disappointingly  Let s delve into the details Harvey  Irma Ground Airlines   Q3 Unit Revenue Views CutHarvey  which wreaked havoc on America s fourth largest city  Houston  with heavy rainfall  has negatively impacted airline operations and caused multiple flight cancellations  In fact  air travel was hurt with two Houston airports  George Bush Intercontinental Airport  IAH  and William P  Hobby Airport  HOU    remaining closed for a few days  since the noon of Aug 27  due to Harvey induced heavy rainfall  The airports are operational now United Continental Holdings  NYSE       the parent company of United Airlines  was the worst hit  as Houston is the carrier s second largest hub  In September 2017  company trimmed its views with respect to pre tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter mainly due to Harvey  The carrier now expects PRASM to decline between 3  and 5  year over year  the earlier guidance provided in July was  1  to   1   In fact  Harvey has impacted the third quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points  The carrier now expects pre tax margin between 8  and 10   previous guidance was 12 5  and 14 5   Spirit Airlines  Nasdaq       which also has significant exposure to Houston  expects its top line to shrink to the tune of approximately  8 5 million in the third quarter due to the natural calamity  Currently  Spirit Airlines anticipates total revenue per available seat mile  TRASM  to decline between 7  and 8 5   the previous guidance was 2  and 4    In fact  per the company  100 basis points of the trimmed guidance can be attributed to the negative impact of Harvey  Also  aggressive competitive pricing in its key markets contributed to the bleak forecast Southwest Airlines  NYSE       which had to call off approximately 2 800 flights due to Harvey  now expects operating revenue per available seat mile  RASM  for the third quarter in the range of down 1  to slightly up  on a year over year basis  The metric was earlier projected to increase approximately 1  from the year ago quarter Close on the heels of Harvey  came another natural calamity  Irma  which also hurt airline operations  American Airlines Group  Nasdaq       which has significant exposure to Florida including its hub at Miami International Airport  had to cancel multiple flights due to Irma  The natural calamity also caused it to trim its third quarter TRASM view High Costs Likely to Hurt Q3With labor deals in vogue in the aviation space  labor costs have escalated  thereby hurting the bottom lines in the last few quarters  The picture is likely to be no different in the third quarter   For example  labor costs shot up significantly at Alaska Air Group  NYSE      following the amendment to the pay related pilots  contract at its subsidiary  Horizon Air Following the agreement  the company expects third quarter cost per available seat mile  excluding fuel and other special items  between 8 cents and 8 05 cents  You can see  Moreover  increasing fuel costs do not bode well for airlines  Oil prices are currently hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  way higher than the lows of around  26 a barrel touched in February last year  The rise in fuel costs  which again may be Harvey induced  are also likely to distort the Q3 earnings picture for airlines Strong Stocks that Should Be in the

the third quarter of 2017  results of which are around the corner  Multiple headwinds of late have prevented the space from flying higher This scenario is reflected in the latest three month performance of the NYSE ARCA Airline Index  The sector tracker has shed value to the tune of 2 5  in the period  The headwinds are likely to negatively impact third quarter results of airline stocks Let s delve into the challenges confronting this key sector Back to Back Natural CalamitiesHurricane Harvey  followed by Irma  caused airline stocks like Delta Air Lines       and United Continental Holdings       to call off multiple flights  United Continental was the worst hit by Harvey  as Houston is the carrier s second largest hub The Chicago based carrier cited Harvey as one of the reasons for trimming its views with respect to pre tax margin and passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a key measure of unit revenue  for the third quarter  In fact  Harvey is expected to hurt third quarter PRASM to the tune of approximately 150 basis points  American Airlines Group       also trimmed guidance for the third quarter due to the devastating impact of Irma That said  recent comments from management teams suggest that the hurricane impact may be a lot less severe than had been expected  This has helped the stocks recover some of their earlier losses High CostsHigh fuel costs are also likely to limit third quarter earnings growth  Harvey contributed to an increase in fuel prices due to gasoline shortages caused by the storm  Fuel costs have been on the rise lately  with oil prices hovering around the  50 a barrel threshold  This upsurge can be attributed to an improving demand outlook for the commodity and OPEC deal extension talks United Continental projects

Escalation in fuel cost apart  the surge in labor costs is also expected to distort the earnings picture of airlines  With airline companies inking pay related deals with various labor groups  costs on this front have spiked  Escalated labor costs have hurt the bottom lines of carriers in the last few quarters  and the third quarter of 2017 is unlikely to be any different Soft Air Fares   Capacity IssuesDeclining air fares are hurting the top lines of carriers  Low air fares bring good news for fliers but are a bane of airline companies According to   air fares  roundtrip  in the United States are likely hit a low of  216 in October  Problems related to capacity over expansion are also hurting carriers  This is highlighted by the fact that the likes Spirit Airlines

factors for most carriers Other HeadwindsThe price war between low cost carriers like Spirit Airlines and legacy carriers like United Continental is another cause for concern in this sector  Issues

Bridgewater s Latest Form 13F Filing
One of the better kept secrets in investing is a form called the 13F HR that all institutional investors who manage over  100 million in assets must submit to the SEC  In the Form 13F  managers have to disclose their holdings giving intelligent observers a sneak peek into their strategy and investments 
Last month  on August 10th  2017 to be exact  Dalio s firm Bridgewater Associates filed their quarterly   We reviewed the 13F filing to get a sneak peek at holdings in Bridgewater s massive portfolio 
Portfolio Overview and Statistics
Bridgewater s stock portfolio totals nearly  11 billion according to the latest filing Quarter over Quarter Turnover  QoQ Turnover  is a measure used to gauge the level of trading activity in a portfolio  QoQ Turnover is calculated by taking the lesser of the total value of new securities purchased or the total value of securities sold over the last quarter and dividing it by the total value of holdings 
Bridgewater s QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was over 25   so the firm appears to trade a significant percent of its portfolio each quarter 
Bridgewater s Largest Holdings
The Ideas section of finbox io tracks top investors and trending investment themes  You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below   The following table summarizes Bridgewater s Largest Holdings reported in the last filing 

The firm s largest positions were mostly ETFs with the Vanguard Emerging Markets index fund  Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets  NYSE VWO   ranking at the top of the list and accounting for 29 5  of the portfolio  Since we were mostly interested in the businesses Mr  Dalio and his team find most promising in the current market environment  we also created a ranking of holdings excluding ETFs

194992,416508,UAL,Iceland Volcano Eruption Could Spell Trouble For Air Travel,news,"By    Another volcano is rumbling in Iceland    and the airlines are quivering  The Bardarbunga volcano  located directly below Iceland s largest glacier  is threatening to erupt  A  swarm  of earthquake activity has been detected in the area since Saturday morning 
There are  very strong indications of ongoing magma movement   Iceland s Meteorological Office said in a statement Monday   Presently there are no signs of eruption  but it cannot be excluded that the current activity will result in an explosive subglacial eruption  leading to an outburst flood and ash emission  
As a result of this new activity  the meteorological office issued an orange alert    the second highest warning level    to the aviation industry on Tuesday  The aviation color codes are used by the industry to measure how dangerous a volcano could be to air travel  The orange level signifies  heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption  
In 2010  the Eyjafjallajokull volcano eruption in Iceland wreaked havoc on aviation  emitting an ash cloud that grounded or rerouted flights over the North Atlantic for six and a half days  Losses to the industry totaled  1 7 billion  according to the International Air Transport Association  a trade group  Some 10 million passengers and 100 000 flights were affected 
Some 50 passenger and cargo airlines regularly fly routes that take them across the North Atlantic  Major international carriers like Delta  Air France and Lufthansa are monitoring the situation closely  reports Bloomberg 
But the number of airlines that could be affected by an eruption is hard to predict  said Henry Harteveldt  an airline industry analyst   A lot will depend on  if there s an explosion  the magnitude and the wind patterns that would disperse the ash   he said 

 We do know that  since 2010  airlines and air traffic organizations learned from the experience of the first ash cloud and have invested in technology that tracks any explosion   he added   They are also able to determine if there are other viable routes that can be kept open  That may mean routing aircraft further north or south of Iceland to go across the Atlantic  The airlines have operation centers that have gone into high alert  
For now  operations are continuing as normal at the three biggest U S  carriers    American Airlines NASDAQ AAL  Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL and United Airlines NYSE UAL    that fly to Europe  representatives told Bloomberg 
But they are aware that anything could happen to disrupt things quickly   The good news for air travel is that both these clusters are away from the heart of the main volcano  as it s in the heart that the kind of magma is produced which leads to highly explosive eruptions that produce the abundant fine ash capable of being transported long distances through the atmosphere   said Dave McGarvie  an expert on volcanology   But we know so little about this volcano that she could surprise us  ",2014-08-20,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/iceland-volcano-eruption-could-spell-trouble-for-air-travel-304570,304570

194994,416510,UAL,Venezuela airline crisis makes travelers ever more inventive,news,"By Girish Gupta  CARACAS  Reuters    Buses across jungle borders  boats through Caribbean waters and private flights from small airfields have become a new norm for departing Venezuela as a multi billion dollar pay dispute turns the country into something of a  no fly  zone   Major international airlines have slashed seat availability by half since last year  pulling many routes entirely in a spat with Venezuela s socialist government about the repatriation of  3 6 billion in ticket revenue   The dwindling supply has sent prices spiraling for available seats  and led to a surge of more inventive travel itineraries via circuitous routes and other means    I ve never flown private but I had to because you just can t get a normal flight   said Orinda Pamfil  23  at the small  exclusive Charallave airport in hills outside Caracas   Unable to find a commercial ticket to the United States  she was lucky to be traveling to Houston in a spare seat on a small plane owned by a friend of a friend   It s impossible for normal Venezuelans to travel   she said  clutching designer luggage   Hiring a seven seat private plane  such as a Learjet 55  costs upwards of  2 500 per hour  said private pilot Carlos da Silva  Used to flying super wealthy clients  he is now receiving calls from groups of middle class Venezuelans looking to share costs    There s been a surge in demand because people are desperate   added another pilot Nicolas Veloz who estimated demand was up at least 20 percent in recent months    They have business  school  health issues abroad  Sometimes people just have to get out in an emergency    Venezuelans unable to afford private planes or find a rare seat on a commercial flight are taking more laborious trips across land and sea   On a recent morning at Caracas  tiny Rutas de America bus terminal  39 year old Yane Gonzalez was about to take a four day trip across the Andes via Colombia to the Peruvian capital Lima thousands of kilometers away    Of course I d rather fly   said Gonzalez  who was giving up her work selling snacks at a kiosk in Caracas to begin a new life in Peru   But we go to the airline and they have no seats    CURRENCY COMPLICATIONS  The airline problem  the latest manifestation of multiple strains across the Venezuelan economy  derives from a government requirement that domestic ticket sales be in local currency   Some 24 airlines have built up the equivalent of  3 6 billion in bolivars but are unable to convert that money into hard currency  according to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   This is due to delays in authorizations from the government which  for over a decade  has operated strict foreign exchange controls    The country unfortunately is disconnecting from the world economy and runs the risk of deeper isolation   said Jason Sinclair  an IATA spokesman   It simply is not sustainable for the airlines to fly to a country where they cannot be paid    Negotiations are underway and around a third of the airlines have reached agreements in principle but the terms are incomplete and  lack any form of guarantees   Sinclair said   International airlines have cut seat availability in and out of Venezuela by 49 per cent on last year  IATA said   Major airlines including Air Canada  TO ACb  and Alitalia earlier this year suspended all flights  citing safety concerns and difficulty in repatriating revenue   Alitalia began flying again earlier this month  though with a limited service   A plethora of others  including American Airlines  O AAL   Delta Airlines  N DAL  and United Airlines  N UAL   slashed most but not all flights earlier this year  European airlines including Lufthansa  DE LHAG  and Iberia have also cut routes   CAPITALIST  WAR   Caracas was American Airlines  first destination in South America more than a quarter century ago but the carrier cut almost 80 percent of its weekly flights to Venezuela in June   The airline said it is owed  791 million  It still runs 10 weekly flights to Venezuela from Miami  though these can now only be paid for abroad in hard currency   A Miami to Caracas return on American Airlines   a six hour flight   for next month is listed at  2 000  A comparable flight from Miami to Bogota  in neighboring Colombia  is around  750   Though his ministers are in discussions with the airlines  President Nicolas Maduro has cast the problem as part of an  economic war  against him by capitalist foes and has threatened airlines that pull out with permanent expulsion    Whoever leaves Venezuela in the midst of this economic war doesn t return     because Venezuela must be respected   said Maduro   He has kept the socialist policies and currency controls of his predecessor Hugo Chavez  who died of cancer last year  but he faces a plethora of problems from shortages of goods to high inflation and an economy that analysts say is in recession   Venezuela s domestic carriers are also struggling because they find it hard to obtain dollars to import parts for maintenance  This has led to a severe shortage of flights  adding to angst for travelers    There are aircraft just sitting on the tarmac  at public airports  because they don t have parts   pilot Veloz added   Some travelers are finding friends or companies with boats to take them to the nearby Caribbean islands such as Aruba  Curacao and Trinidad where onward flight availability to popular destinations like New York or Miami is much easier   One travel agent struggling to find a customer flights to the nearby tourist islands of Los Roques suggested hiring a private catamaran instead   Many travel agents are struggling to make a living  They protested earlier this year outside the tourism ministry and some have given up their work   Others are up for the challenge

194995,416511,UAL,U S  flight woes linger after Chicago air traffic center fire,news,"By Laila Kearney  Reuters    U S  airports reported hundreds of residual flight cancellations on Saturday  a day after a fire at a Chicago area air traffic control center that authorities said was set by an employee who then tried to take his own life 
The incident forced the evacuation of the Federal Aviation Administration control center in Aurora  Illinois  and severely snarled air traffic on Friday  when an estimated 2 100 flights were canceled at major airports across the country 
The impact stretched into Saturday with a further 1 100 flight cancellations nationwide  more than double the number of cancellations for the entire day before the fire  according to tracking website FlightAware 
A storm carrying heavy winds also disrupted travel at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  leading to about 20 cancellations and temporarily halting takeoffs and landings  the airport said 
Nearly 60 percent of the cancellations took place at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  one of the world s busiest and located near the damaged flight center 
O Hare is the largest hub of United Airlines  N UAL  and a major hub for American Airlines  O AAL   The airport averaged about 2 700 flights a day in August with a daily average of about 220 000 passengers in the month  according data posted on its website 
Brian Howard  36  who lives in the Chicago suburb of Naperville  was charged on Friday in U S  District Court in Chicago with one felony count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities  prosecutors said 
Howard  who has worked at the control center for eight years  is suspected of starting the fire in its basement at about 5 40 a m  local time  0640 EDT   according to an affidavit attached to the complaint 
Howard had recently been told he was being transferred to Hawaii  it said 
Shortly before the fire  a private message was posted to Howard s Facebook account that said he was  about to take out  the control center and take his own life  the affidavit said  A relative forwarded the message to police 
Arriving at the scene of the fire  which was quickly extinguished but not before causing damage  paramedics followed a trail of blood and encountered Howard shirtless with cut wounds on his arms and saw him slicing at his own throat  the affidavit said 
Howard remains hospitalized and no court date has been set  prosecutors said  He could face up to 20 years in prison and a  250 000 fine if convicted 
The FAA was assessing the damage caused by the blaze  which may be significant  but hoped to restore air traffic to relatively normal levels over the next few days  officials said 

Air traffic was being handled by other control centers in the region

194996,416512,UAL,United Continental Holdings  Is UAL A Solid Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  United Continental has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 19  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 85  If we focus on the long term PE trend  United Continental s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 9 54 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands much below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Transportation sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 89  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that United Continental s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  United Continental has a P S ratio of about 0 54  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 13 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  United Continental currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes United Continental a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for United Continental is 3 77  a level that is lower than the industry average of 4 48  Clearly  UAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though United Continental might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade and Momentum score of B  each  This gives UAL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased roughly 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below United Continental Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus    Thanks to this bullish trend  the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineClearly  United Continental is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Along with a solid Zacks Rank  the stock possesses a strong industry rank  Top 13  out of over 250 Zacks industries   Incidentally  over the past one year  the industry has clearly surpassed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains

194997,416513,UAL,3 Best Airline Stocks To Buy Right Now,opinion,"When video emerged online showing a passenger being dragged off a United Continental   NYSE UAL   flight earlier this year  consumers  analysts  and investors alike reacted in horror  Shares of the Chicago based carrier took a huge hit as a result of the incident  and the legacy airline s market cap lost upwards of  950 million 
In a statement  United said four crew members needed to get to a flight departing from Louisville otherwise it would be canceled  and passengers were asked to voluntarily give up their seats  However  no one volunteered  and four passengers were then selected at random  including David Dao  the man who was forcibly removed 
What happened onboard in April was not United s last PR mess that surfaced  Soon after  the airline  two teenage girls from boarding a flight after a gate agent decided the leggings they were wearing were inappropriate  The incident was first reported by a fellow passenger on Twitter   NYSE TWTR    and subsequently went viral 
But the girls were apparently  pass travelers   a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis  leggings violated this specific dress code  since pass travelers are  representing  the airline 
Incidents like these began popping up all over the Internet and traditional news sites  detailing the poor customer service experienced on flights across the industry  From an American Airlines    NASDAQ AAL   crew member yanking away a mother s stroller and almost hitting her child to the death of a giant rabbit named Simon on a United flight  viral stories about flying nightmares were nonstop 
Industry Outlook
Despite one public relations disaster after another  the airline industry kept chugging along  and right now  Transportation Airline sits in the top 8  of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank  the sector has also returned over 10 5  year to date  which is on par with the S P 500  and 36  over the past 12 months 
Historically  airline stocks were and they still are a turbulent investment  closely tied to fluctuating oil prices  But during periods of low oil prices and steady economic growth  like the type of environment we re in now  airlines see their profits rise  Since 2014  U S  airline stocks as a group  almost 90  
The International Air Transport Association  IATA  expects the global airline industry to bring in  30 billion in profits this year  with 4 billion projected travelers  The earnings represent a 4 1  net profit margin on top of total revenue of  736 billion 
Even Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   CEO Warren Buffet  who publicly denounced airline investments in the past  sees promise in the industry  Last year  the famous investor bought stakes in all four major U S  carriers  United  American  Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL    and Southwest   NYSE LUV   
Given this overall bullish sentiment  let s take a look at three airline stocks investors should consider for their portfolio 
SkyWest   NASDAQ SKYW   operates one of the larger regional airlines in the U S   and provides passenger and air freight services  The carrier sits at a  2  Buy  on the Zacks Rank  and boasts a VGM score of  A   with individual Style Scores of  A  in Value and Growth 
SkyWest expects year over year earnings growth of 18 59  for the current year  and three analysts have revised their estimates upwards in the last 30 days compared to none lower  The company has an average earnings surprise of nearly 13   while SkyWest has also beaten expectations in the past four consecutive quarters  In the past one year  SKYW has given its investors a solid return of over 30  
Delta is one of the country s fastest growing international carriers  and has added more international capacity than all other U S  airlines combined  Sitting at a  1  Strong Buy  on the Zacks Rank  Delta also has a Value Style Score of  A   with an overall VGM score of  B  
The Atlanta based airline anticipates year over year earnings growth of about 3 6  for the current year  with three positive estimate revisions in the last 30 days compared to only one negative revision in the same time frame  Delta has beaten expectations in three of the past four consecutive quarters  and has an average earnings surprise of almost 2   Shares of DAL have surged over the past year  gaining over 35  
Despite its many PR setbacks  United is actually looking to be a pretty promising pick  The airline is one of the largest in the world  and is the holding company for United Airlines and Continental Airlines  United is currently a  2  Buy  on the Zacks Rank  and has a VGM score of  A   with Value and Growth Style Scores of  A  and  B   respectively 
While United expects earnings loss of about 9  for the current year  the airline s earnings do appear to bounce back next year  with United projecting year over year growth of over 12 5   This  however  does not come as a surprise  as the airline was hit hard financially earlier this year  Historically  United has beaten earnings in the past four consecutive quarters  and has an average earnings surprise of 5 4   Over the past 12 months  UAL has gained almost 39

emerged online showing a passenger being dragged off a United Continental  NYSE       flight earlier this year  consumers  analysts  and investors alike reacted in horror  Shares of the Chicago based carrier took a huge hit as a result of the incident  and the legacy airline s market cap lost upwards of  950 million In a statement  United said four crew members needed to get to a flight departing from Louisville otherwise it would be canceled  and passengers were asked to voluntarily give up their seats  However  no one volunteered  and four passengers were then selected at random  including David Dao  the man who was forcibly removed What happened onboard in April was not United s last PR mess that surfaced  Soon after  the airline  two teenage girls from boarding a flight after a gate agent decided the leggings they were wearing were inappropriate  The incident was first reported by a fellow passenger on Twitter  and subsequently went viral But the girls were apparently  pass travelers   a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis  leggings violated this specific dress code  since pass travelers are  representing  the airline Incidents like these began popping up all over the Internet and traditional news sites  detailing the poor customer service experienced on flights across the industry  From an American Airlines   NASDAQ      crew member yanking away a mother s stroller and almost hitting her child to the death of a giant rabbit named Simon on a United flight  viral stories about flying

were and they still are a turbulent investment  closely tied to fluctuating oil prices  But during periods of low oil prices and steady economic growth  like the type of environment we re in now  airlines see their profits rise  Since 2014  U S  airline stocks as a group  almost 90  The International Air Transport Association  IATA  expects the global airline industry to bring in  30 billion

194999,416515,UAL,Delta Air Lines  A Winner Among Legacy Carriers,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE  NYSE DAL  appears to have fundamental strengths that are not currently reflected in its stock price  In the second half of 2016  all legacy carriers including American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   United Continental  NYSE UAL  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  saw a rapid increase in their stock valuations as market sentiment improved for the entire sector  Even Warren Buffett  who has been a long time skeptic of the sector  ended up investing billions in major airlines  However  these legacy carriers have been on a roller coaster ride year to date and have underperformed the broader S P 500 index 
Fundamental Strengths of Delta Air Lines
Delta Air Lines has a strong management team that has increased their focus on profitability in the last few years  This has allowed the company to post healthy margins while keeping its debt at a reasonable level  While other carriers like American Airlines have gone on an aircraft buying binge  DAL has been much more conservative in its capacity expansion 
Within the airline industry  one of the most important metrics is passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM   Delta has started posting quality improvements in this metric  The company showed 3 5  PRASM growth in May  2 5  gain in June and 2 7  growth in July  compared to the year ago period  Management has also forecasted 2 5  4 5  growth in PRASM in Q3  On the other hand  rival United has forecast  1  to 1  PRASM growth due to higher competition on its most profitable routes 
Healthy operating margins act as a long term competitive advantage within the airline industry  Superior margins vs  peers help an airline adjust more easily to new competitors and a changing pricing environment  In the past few quarters  Delta and Southwest have consistently outperformed other legacy carriers in this metric 

EBITDA less capital expenditures is a measure of free cash flow  FCF  and is useful for comparing companies that are  CapEx  intensive such as airlines  Delta and Southwest clearly have superior EBITDA less CapEx margins to American Airlines and United Dealing With Gulf State AirlinesIn the past few years  one of the biggest threats for American carriers has been the growth of Gulf state airlines  The chief offenders among them are Qatar  Emirates and Etihad airlines  American and European carriers have alleged that these Gulf state carriers are getting enormous subsidies from their government who want to transition their economy s dependence away from oil  It is alleged that these subsidies have allowed Gulf carriers to provide luxurious services at cheap rates and expand at a rapid pace on international routes 
In short  Delta has suffered due to the growth of these gulf state carriers  However  Delta has also started building a strong defense against these carriers through partnerships with other international airlines  It recently extended a partnership with Air France KLM through an investment of  411 million for a 10  equity stake  It has also committed to increasing transatlantic joint ventures with Virgin Atlantic  Air France  KLM  and Alitalia  Delta works closely with Air France to manage fares and schedules on US Europe flights 
Besides strengthening the partnership with outside European carriers  Delta is also ramping up its media initiatives to make a case against gulf state carriers  It has recently launched its  Our Future Our Fight  campaign where employees show the impact that unfair competition has on the company and themselves  The main argument of the campaign is that unfair expansion of gulf carriers hurts American jobs  American national security  and the wider economy  It is stated that every international route that Delta surrenders leads to a loss of 1 500 American jobs  This campaign may bring support from both sides of the political spectrum which could limit the ability of gulf carriers to undercut American carriers going forward Attractive Valuation
Delta is trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its peers considering the better operational and financial metrics it boasts 
source  finbox io
Delta has also increased its dividend to  0 305 per share from  0 203 per share lifting the dividend yield to 2 6   In comparison  American Airlines offers a mere 0 88  yield  Southwest provides a 0 93  yield and United does not currently pay a dividend  In terms of long term debt  Delta and Southwest again look most attractive having a debt to total capital ratio of 20 8  and 11 8   respectively  While Delta has limited its capital investments over the last few years  carriers like American Airlines have invested billions of dollars in new airplanes  Delta s low debt level should allow it to selectively invest in future growth options and also reduces the total risk to the stock dividend 
Furthermore  Delta shares currently have over 30  upside according to finbox io s DCF model  which applies the consensus forecast from Wall Street analysts 

source  finbox io
Even with low single digit revenue growth and declining EBITDA margins  Delta offers value investors a healthy margin of safety 
Conclusion  Delta Offers Long Term Upside
Long term investors who want to invest in a legacy carrier should find a good option in Delta Air Lines  Operationally  the airline is a much stronger carrier than either United or American  It has a strong capital structure and provides a healthy dividend yield to investors  At the same time  the stock trades at a discounted valuation to other carriers  Finbox io calculates that Delta has over 30  upside relative to its current trading price offering investors a quality margin of safety ",2017-08-22,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delta-air-lines-a-winner-among-legacy-carriers-200208757,200208757
195000,416516,UAL,Airline Stocks Sink As WOW Air Expands Into The Midwest,opinion,"WOW Air  an Iceland based low cost airline  announced on Wednesday that it will expand into four Midwest cities  causing major airline stocks to tumble 
The Icelandic company known for its cheap tickets to Europe is adding service to St  Louis  Cleveland  Cincinnati  and Detroit  This will bring the company to a total of 12 U S  destinations 
One way tickets to Iceland will start at  99 99 from all four cities  Connecting flights to WOW s other European locations will begin at  149 99 
When asked if there was enough demand in the Midwest for the new non stop flights to Iceland  WOW Air founder and CEO Skuli Mogensen said yes   With those kind of prices  we have seen in other markets that we enter that we have stimulated the market significantly  
 Our unique opportunity is to use Iceland as a hub  We can then distribute to our main destinations in Europe  be it London  Paris  Amsterdam  Frankfurt  Berlin  Copenhagen  etc    Mogensen said   That s really the key  Instead of having a single point to point flight  we actually give you a very affordable flight to multiple destinations  
In reaction to this news  major airline stocks fell  Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   stock closed 2 06  lower at  46 18   American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   stock tumbled 3 17  to  43 97  Meanwhile  shares of United Continental   NYSE UAL   tumbled 2 89  to  62 83  and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   stock went down 3 22  to  51 72 
WOW s new routes will launch in the spring  with tickets going on sale Wednesday 
4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on

195002,416518,UAL,Airline Scandals Don t Mean Cheaper Flights,opinion,"Starting a few months ago  airline scandals started to populate our news feeds  The United  NYSE UAL  is the most notorious  but the event created a micro genre of the meme economy  outrage at the incompetence and poor service of various airlines 
This outrage is nothing new  but the immediacy of the internet and social media brought each new offense into the public consciousness  The events have been spread out across multiple airlines   seemingly every single one  in fact  However  this hasn t resulted in customer service or value improvements that you might have hoped for  with a couple of notable exceptions 
Airlines that have avoided the scourge of scandal have capitalized on the opportunity  Frequent flyer programs like Southwest Airlines or Canada s Aeroplan offer  that are sure to save you a pretty penny when booking a flight etc 
Airlines recovering from scandal  however  are not greatly motivated to improve services following public scandals for a variety of reasons 
Brand Loyalty   Among most travelers  there is not a great deal of brand loyalty  airline to airline   at the time of ticket purchase than by any other factor  As scandals have become more ubiquitous  among seemingly all commercial airline companies  the distinction between airline competitors is obscured  It seems all an airline has to do is offer savings  and ticket sales will improve 
Lack of Consumer Options  Even though there is competition in the airline space  a consumer can be only so choosy  With only a handful of airlines available at the consumer s price point at a single airline  the options are limited  Even if a consumer is angry with one or two airlines  they still need air travel to get to their destination  This motivates most consumers to bury the hatchet and go with an airline that will get them where they need to go  according to the price considerations mentioned above 
Airline Margins are Tight  At the end of the day  an airline can t simply slash prices to recover lost consumer goodwill    Airlines like United that have significant negative media attention are already suffering immediate losses in the short term  From a corporate standpoint  it can be much better to just wait out the media storm for passengers to return  rather than doubling losses by offering discounts that eliminate the slim profits the airlines already have to deal with 
At the end of the day  air travel is a remarkable industry that has inconveniences and inefficiencies baked in  As always  the best way to find a cheap ticket is to look for it well ahead of time 
It s also important to remember that major problems while traveling by air are infrequent  Sure  we all know someone who has had misplaced luggage or who had a flight cancelled due to mechanical delay  These problems are baked into the system and will not result in reliable savings  Consumers are best served when they use the tools available to them to locate cheap tickets many months in advance of their travel date ",2017-07-23,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/airline-scandals-don’t-mean-cheaper-flights-200202780,200202780
195003,416519,UAL,Hawaiian Holdings  HA  Stock Plunges After Earnings  Lowered Price Target,opinion,"On Wednesday  shares of Hawaiian Airlines parent company Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA   are plunging  down over 9  in late morning trading to  40 12 per share as a result of its second quarter financial results yesterday after the bell and a new lowered price target 
Hawaiian reported earnings of  1 58 per share  excluding 9 cents from non recurring items   which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 53 per share  Total revenues came in at  675 million  lagging just behind our consensus estimate of  676 million but growing over 30  year over year 
The airline reported a solid 7 6  increase in revenue per available seat mile  RASM   an important airline industry metric  This allowed Hawaiian to fully offset significant increases in fuel prices and non fuel unit costs  and resulted in the company s adjusted pre tax profit to jump 17  year over year 
During Q2  Hawaiian Holdings announced some new routes and increased frequencies  including extended seasonal non stop service between Los Angeles International Airport  LAX  and Kaua i s Lihu e Airport  LIH  to year round non stop service  The company also announced expanded service for 2018 between North America and Hawai I  which capitalizes on the introduction of the A321neo to Hawaiian s fleet 
These expansions are a good sign  as United Continental   NYSE UAL   notably plans to significantly increase its service to Hawaii next year 
 Our string of outstanding results continued into the second quarter   said Mark Dunkerley  Hawaiian Airlines president and CEO    These results have come courtesy of strong demand for the Hawai i vacation  low fuel prices  moderate industry capacity  and an excellent job done by my colleagues in finding new ways to strengthen our performance  
Looking ahead  Hawaiian Holdings expects adjusted non fuel unit costs to increase 7  10  in the third quarter  The company also projects RASM to rise 4 5  7 5  year over year  However  Hawaiian is lowering its guidance range for economic fuel cost per gallon for full year fiscal 2017 
And today  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  lowered its price target on Hawaiian Holdings to  52 from  64  with the firm maintaining a Hold rating  DB also expects RASM growth to slow sequentially based on  Sep Q RASM guidance despite an easier y o y comp lower capacity growth at HA  
Currently  HA is a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  Shares of Hawaiian have lost over 21  in value year to date

195029,416545,UAL,Chart Of The Day  Investors Unite Behind United Airlines Holdings,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
On July 12  United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL  shares gapped up  opening 2 35 percent higher than the previous close  and closed higher on the day by 4 7 percent  at  80 53  The surge occurred on the news that the airline s consolidated traffic in terms of revenue per passenger mile rose 3 4 percent  while consolidated capacity rose 5 percent YoY 
The airline also released an upward revision of an important industry metric  passenger unit revenue  which the airline expected would rise 2 percent  meeting the company s average guidance 
The company s President  Scott Kirby announced 

 Last month s performance capped off an exceptional first half of our operation  and we look to continue the momentum through the second half of the year and beyond  

This most recent data led analysts to raise their estimates on the stock  ahead of the company s report  which is scheduled to occur later today  Consensus estimates for earnings were shifted up from  2 47 to  2 71 EPS  vs   2 61 YoY 
Turning Lemons Into Lemonade
On July 13  the following day  United unveiled its  flex schedule  program  to deal with overbooking problems  by reselling overbooked passenger seats 
The program is a juicer  meaning it will help the company turn sour lemons into refreshing lemonade  The airline is clearly working on how to solve problems that have been dogging them as well as the industry bad publicity  four figure payouts to passengers willing to relinquish their seats at the gate  or being forced to lower their sales while simultaneously turning a profit 

On June 2  the airline s stock reached an all time high of  83 04 and  82 03 record close  The much lower close formed a bearish shooting star  which preceded a 10 37 percent decline to the July 5   74 43 low  The all time high shooting star proved to be the head of a H S top  after the May left shoulder and the June right shoulder 
On June 29  the price completed the pattern when it crossed below its reversal line  at  76 35 per its angle at the time  closing at  75 44  However  its year long uptrend line and 100 dma  blue  provided it support on July 5  from which point it climbed from the low of  74 43 to the July 13   81 39 high  In doing so  it crossed back above the H S neckline  rendering the pattern s bearish nature a failure  turning it into a bullish consolidating pattern 
Fundamentals and Technicals Don t Align
The initial news  the data upward revision  occurred on July 12  but the stock price had already been climbing since July 5  five sessions earlier  Was that a coincidence  or had  informed money  already acted on it  Note  the bearish H S top was completed  but the news changed the picture on its head and shoulders 
The second piece of news  about the a flex schedule  was released the following day  But while the stock advanced  it still closed below the previous day s close  It should have been surprising that such promising news something that had the United executive board estimating how much would be added to the bottom line would not have helped the stock price at all  Unless  of course  informed money had already driven the stock up before the news became public 
The H S was real  This can be confirmed with the falling MACD  but more importantly with volume  The formation of the head was accompanied by diminishing volume on the upside and rising volume on the downside  making it clear that participation was on the downside  The formation of the right shoulder was accompanied by diminishing volume on the upside and rising volume on the downside 
Finally  the return above the neckline  which rendered the pattern a failure  was accompanied by rising volume  while the short term declines within the July 5 to July 13 rally  two red candle pairs  were accompanied by diminishing volume  suggesting the declines are merely corrections within the rally 
The MACD had been rising from an oversold condition its shorter MA rising above its longer MA suggesting recent price data is rising higher than longer price data  providing a buy signal 
The Volume Oscillator confirms the direction of the rising volume  Yesterday  it reached the support of its uptrend line since the H S formation 
Price has crossed above the 50 dma  green  after the upward data revision on July 12  while the 100 dma  blue  guards the H S pattern  and the 200 dma  red  is guarding the 2 year uptrend line 
Target Implication
The size of the pattern is  6 50  or 7 85   though targets are derived based on a point measurement  not a percent  It provides a minimum target price of  89 50 or 7 25  
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders may wait on a long for overcoming the June 2   83 04 top resistance  as well as for a downward correction  which should be above the July 5  74 43 low  This would constitute a viable uptrend  That requires two series of rising peaks and troughs 
Moderate traders would rely upon the pattern failure but may wait for a further correction toward  79 before going long  Alternatively  they could rely on a close above the June 12   80 53 close   if not a close above the July 13  81 39 high

Analyst Joseph DeNardi of Stifel Financial Corp  downgraded HA to a  sell  rating with a 12 month target price of  40  down from a  hold  rating and a  60 price target

Besides increasing its services on 11 routes  United Airlines is also changing their service quality  The airline says lie flat seats will be added to four routes  including Hawaii to Denver  as they try to compete with rival airlines who have already added such seats to overnight flights 
DeNardi cited this move by United Airlines for HA s downgrade  He told investors in a research note that competitive capacity is  finally coming   The analyst said that United s announcement shifts Hawaiian s competitive capacity outlook as United increases their capacity by 20  next year 
HA remains a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Our current consensus estimates suggest that the company still has positive EPS and sales growth for the current quarter  The competition is increasing for Hawaiian Airlines  but the company s stock still has strength

195081,416597,UAL,Shares Of Spirit Airlines  SAVE  Tumble After Flight Cancellations  Airport Chaos,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of discount airliner Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   are tumbling  down about 3 8  in late morning trading after the company had to abruptly cancel nine flights Monday evening  with passenger frustration culminating in fights with Spirit employees at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport in Florida 
In the latest incident of airline chaos  multiple videos were posted online showing altercations that had broken out between travelers and airline employees  with authorities doing their best to restore order  While some passengers were pulled aside from the crowd  others were forcibly taken to the ground or placed in handcuffs 
 Passengers erupted in anger overnight after Spirit Airlines canceled  nine  flights at   WATCH     CBS This Morning   CBSThisMorning  But problems have certainly been building for Spirit  as the airline had to  over the past seven days due to its lawsuit against its own pilot union  The airline alleges  an unlawful job action by Spirit pilots   and said that the Air Line Pilots Association  APLA  and some of its members are  purposely and unlawfully disrupting  its  operations  
CNN notes that just on Sunday  the airline had to cancel 81 flights   comprising 17  of the carrier s scheduled flights for the day   And  Spirit estimates roughly 20 000 customers have been affected by the lawsuit 
  you re a mess in ft lauderdale  Employees give no answers and rude to passengers    tees32      TinaStawinski   The Spirit pilots  concerted refusal to accept junior assignments or pick up open time flying has dramatically impacted Spirit s operations leading to cancellations throughout its system  and most particularly for flights departing from Fort Lauderdale  Chicago O Hare  Detroit  and Las Vegas   said the airline

195097,416613,UAL,Why United Airlines Is Dumb    Dumb    Dumb,opinion,"We all love to hate the airlines 
The cramped seats  The lousy food  Delayed or cancelled flights  And now we have this week s incident at United Continental Inc  NYSE UAL  
By now  virtually everyone knows the story  To avoid cancelling a flight the next morning  United needed to find space for four employees on a sold out flight from Chicago s O Hare International Airport 
Yet not enough passengers would volunteer to give up their seats 
So the gate staff chose an onboard passenger at random   Dr  David Dao   and told him to get off the flight 
Dao refused 
So the airline called the police  And in a video that has been viewed millions of times on YouTube  security drags him  bleeding from the mouth  off the plane 
In the annals of PR fiascoes  this may have set a new low  Especially after CEO Oscar Mu oz   though he later issued an abject apology   initially made flimsy   CYA  excuses for the outrage  even referring to Dao s  ahem  reaccommodation 
The sad thing is United  a company with a troubled history   including the largest bankruptcy ever by an airline and the sixth largest by a U S  corporation   has recently enjoyed a string of successes 
Its shares have nearly doubled since last summer and tripled over the last five years 

But this week s events gave the company a black eye  And gave plenty of ammunition to anti business populists who would like to fine the airline  outlaw the practice of overbooking  and drag Mu oz before Congress for the ritual public humiliation   Recall a stammering John Stumpf last year at the hands of Elizabeth Warren  
A friend of mine   Hal   lost no time chiding me for regularly praising the private sector and criticizing the government 

 See   he said   This week s incident shows everyone how corporations really feel about their customers  

Except Hal has it exactly backward  What United Airlines did was stupid   and outlandish   precisely because the company behaved like a government agency  using brute force to achieve its objectives 
In a free market economy  every transaction is supposed to be voluntary  If you don t like a company  you don t have to supply it  work for it  buy from it or own its shares 
It s governments   not businesses   that require peaceful  law abiding citizens to accede to their demands whether they want to or not 
What United did was especially foolish since there is a simple  quick  free market solution to overbooked flights  It s called a gate auction 
For example  imagine 211 people show up for a flight with 200 seats  The airline would offer a voucher for a certain amount  say  300  for 11 volunteers to surrender their seats  If it can t get 11 people to accept that  it has to raise the price to  400  then  500 and  ultimately  to whatever amount it takes to get 11 people to agree to give up their seats 
Trust me  That solution is far cheaper than the eventual settlement with Dao and his attorneys will be 
Many of the things we don t like about airlines are actually market driven solutions  For example  airline executives learned years ago that the overwhelming majority of passengers are interested in one thing and one thing only  the cheapest price 
Most fliers will give up additional legroom  checked luggage  drinks and snacks  and other frills for a lower ticket price  So airlines make flights as cheap as possible and then charge for the extras 
The ultimate beneficiary is the flier  You get less expensive flights  And if you want more  you can pay for it 
As for overbooking  the practice is legal  makes good economic sense  and doesn t inconvenience many passengers 
The Department of Transportation reported that 41 000 fliers were involuntarily bumped from flights last year  That sounds like a lot until you realize that there were 660 million passengers in 2016 
So we re talking about 0 006  of fliers 
Yes  airlines overbook to boost sales and earnings  But it also saves you money 
If your flights regularly had tons of empty seats   thanks to all the cancellations and changes   your ticket price would be higher 
Airlines actually do a pretty good job of getting us from Point A to Point B  Flying is considerably safer than driving   And it s a long swim to Europe or Asia  
So let s hope that United   and its competitors   smarten up about overbooking and use a gate auction every time 
If they want us to fly their friendly skies  they need to give us the treatment we deserve 
Paying customers are indispensable assets  Markets work better than force

195098,416614,UAL,Hot Stocks  After The Scandal  Now Might Be A Good Time To Buy United ,opinion,"There s a saying by Warren Buffett that we bring up a lot around here   Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful  If you ve taken that on as one of your personal investment mantras then your ears might have perked up a little when you first heard about the   Oh you didn t hear  Allow me to inform you 
A few days ago  a Dr  Dao was aboard a United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL   already buckled up and ready to get in the air  He had paid for his seat just as you d expect  However  the airline decided to put 4 United employees on the already fully booked flight  meaning that 4 passengers would have to leave  The airline offered volunteers  800 apiece  but no one volunteered 
Airline representatives asked Dr  Dao to step forward  but he refused saying that he had patients who needed his care the next day  After repeated requests  the airline decided to force the issue  and Dr  Dao was literally beaten and dragged from the plane  He suffered a broken nose  damaged sinuses  a concussion  and other injuries  The whole event was recorded on multiple passenger devices  even the part when Dr  Dao rushed back onto the plane  bleeding profusely  babbling in his concussed state about how the airline people were going to kill him 
Then What Happened 
United s CEO responded by doing exactly what you shouldn t do in a situation like this  He doubled down  reporting that the passenger was disorderly  By that time  UAL had tumbled  with more than  1 3 Billion in dumped shares at the time of this writing 
 The CEO has since relented  going on the record that the video of the event caused him  shame   but is the damage done  or is this a good time to snap up some cheap UAL 
No  Don t 
That s right folks  By the look of it  the United Airline scandal is far from over  With Dr  Dao s lawyer announcing that his client will need reconstructive surgery  and video recordings of the brutal event available from multiple angles  I think we have not seen the full extent of this stock s punishment  Stay tuned for next week when I think we ll see what the damage really is  both to the stock and to Dr  Dao  
It s not just that this unfortunate event happened  or that it was reported  The major factor is the fact that the internet latched onto this story  then latched its teeth into United  If you spend any time at all on Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR   or Reddit  you saw a gruesome outpouring of bile at United and everything they represent 
For many internet people  especially those who do not travel frequently by air  one airline is very much like the next  The public  especially those who live most of their waking hours online  now know United as  that airline   and this impression is going to stick 
United sits as a price point shared by several other airlines  The next time you  and a million travelers like you  go online and see their ticket offered by 4 airlines at about the same price  they re going to see United and remember Dr  Dao s bloody  terrified face 
If I had to guess  I d be we see a 10  drop in UAL by next week and  eventually  the sacking of Oscar Mu oz  This is one of the great corporate scandals in recent memory  and easily the most significant in terms of contemporary internet culture 
UAL s fundamentals are actually fairly good  Their P E ratio and revenue trends are noteworthy  but not enough to pull them out of this public relations tailspin 
If you ve got UAL  dump it now if you haven t already  If you want to play the short game  UAL is probably as safe a bet as you re gonna get ",2017-04-16,Modest Money,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/hot-stocks:-after-the-scandal,-now-might-be-a-good-time-to-buy-united-200183022",200183022

Delta was one of of the top performing U S  airlines in 2015 and the first half of 2016 despite mixed earnings in the past two years  However  last quarter the airliner missed bottom line expectations by 2 cents  recording a YoY decline in growth of 45   Revenues however impressed  coming in around  100M higher than anticipated  but flat on a year over year  YoY  basis 
Revenue has been the airline s biggest problem  continually coming in flat or negative YoY  Choppy domestic pricing on top of weaker business travel trends had a material impact on results in fiscal 2015  Moreover  key metrics including PRASM  passenger revenue per available seat mile  continue to fall short of expectations  Just last week Delta cut its Q1 unit revenue forecast to  0 5   blaming weakened ticket sales closer to departure

The Labor Department s JOLT survey  or Job Openings and Labor Turnover  shows job openings rose 2 1 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted 5 7 million  While more employers are seeking workers  hiring fell 2 percent compared to January to 5 3 million  Job openings have increased 3 2 percent over the past 12 months 
More than 2 5 million people quit their jobs in February  but that was a sharp 19 6 percent decline from January  More people quitting their job is a positive sign because workers typically only quit one job when they have another job  or are optimistic they can find one  And the reason workers change jobs is typically motivated by better pay  So  this is where optimism meets reality 
The  said its monthly sentiment gauge fell 0 6 point to 104 7  Small business optimism declined as sales expectations and earnings came back to earth after a post election surge 
In March  some warning signs appeared  The uncertainty index rose to 93  its second highest reading on record  Bill Dunkelberg  the groups  chief economist  noted 

More small business owners are having a difficult time anticipating the factors that affect their businesses  especially government policy 

But pessimism was widespread in March  Of 10 survey components  only three notched an increase  Owners say they re still struggling to find qualified labor  85  report few or no qualified applicants for open positions  More survey respondents said finding qualified workers was their single biggest business problem  more than those citing weak sales  Economic expectations remain  very elevated   with 46  expecting better conditions six months from now

In the United States  farmers facing a fourth straight year of declining incomes and rising debts are hanging on to grain in the hope of higher prices later  They may be waiting a long time  The overflow in the United States has prompted a rush for temporary storage 
The USDA has approved permits for more than 1 2 billion bushels of temporary and emergency grain storage  such as tarp covered piles and open air mounds  That s a record amount  according to the USDA  The USDA forecasts net farm income will fall 8 7 percent this year to  62 3 billion  the lowest level since 2009 
 lawmakers have approved a plan to make attending public colleges and universities free for students from middle class families  New York is the first state to offer free four year tuition  Previously  Tennessee and Oregon created programs that made community college tuition free 
Altogether  the program is expected to cost New York  163 million and is expected to benefit roughly 940 000 families  although it might require a college degree to understand the details  The New York plan  nicknamed the Excelsior Scholarship  will be phased in over three years  Families earning up to  100 000 a year will qualify in 2017  families making up to  110 000 per year can participate in 2018 and families with income up to  125 000 can take part in the program in 2019 
Students must first apply for  and use  other money like federal Pell Grants  before turning to the scholarship  By zeroing out tuition  low income students won t be able to use their other scholarship and grant money to cover living expenses  Books  fees  food  housing and incidentals aren t covered by this scholarship  so students without family support must work or borrow 
The Excelsior Scholarship is good for two years for a two year program like an associate s degree  or four years for a four year program  Only about one third of students earn a degree in 4 years or less  There will be deferments for graduate school and  extreme hardship  
The plan also requires students to work in New York state for at least two years after they receive an associate s degree  or four years post bachelor s  If they leave  the full grant retroactively becomes a loan  This is how New York taxpayers will be repaid for their investment in a more educated workforce 
It s only April  and nine retailers have already filed for bankruptcy since the start of the year  as many as all of last year  Annual retail bankruptcies peaked at a total of 20 in 2008  a level that the U S  could reach by September if the current rate of filings continues 
Payless ShoeSource  hhgregg Inc  OTC HGGGQ   The Limited  NASDAQ NCTY   RadioShack  BCBG  Wet Seal  Gormans  NYSE GRC   Eastern Co  NASDAQ EML   and Gander Mountain are among the retailers that have filed for bankruptcy so far  this year  and most are closing hundreds of stores as a result  On top of those closures  retailers that are staying in business  at least for now  are shutting down a record number of stores  More than 3 500 stores are expected to close over the next several months 
Traditional retailers with large fleets of physical stores have been hit the hardest  Visits to shopping malls have been declining for years with the rise of e commerce and titanic shifts in how shoppers spend their money  Visits declined by 50  between 2010 and 2013  Malls across the country are struggling to stay open as stores close in droves  But it s getting increasingly more difficult to find replacements for lost tenants 
By now you ve seen the video of the United Airlines  NYSE UAL  passenger dragged off the plane  This is a case study that will be re lived in textbooks for years  an example of how not to do it  United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz today released another statement regarding the violent removal of a fare paying passenger from one of his airline s flights over the weekend 
After two poorly received releases on Monday  Munoz has finally apologized to the customer  The tone of Munoz s latest statement is a departure from his first  which apologized only for having to  re accommodate  certain passengers  Yea  I remember watching Mike Tyson re accommodate his opponents in the ring  but I never saw it on an airplane 
In a later letter  Munoz reaffirmed his support for his employees  their work just got much more difficult  And the apology would have resonated better if it had come out before United shares lost close to  1 billion in value intraday  shares closed down 1 1   a loss of about  250 million   The incident is not all that surprising  rather it seems like a sign of the times 
Yesterday  we talked about the Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  report on its fake accounts scandal  which included  75 million in clawbacks from 2 key executives who were earlier fired  The chairman of the board was also making the media rounds trying to persuade skeptical newscasters that having Stumpf retain 3 4 of the pay he d earned when the abuses were underway was adequate 
The New York Times depicted the report as  scathing   In fact  it is a carefully crafted document to dump all responsibility on Stumpf and Toldstedt  both of whom clearly are culpable  and shield the board and the new CEO  Anyone who knows much about banking will see clear footprints that the board ignored basic risk management failures and poor governance structures 
The report describes the glaring risk management failures  But the report tries to normalize them as being unfortunate features of how Wells did business that worked out badly rather than glaringly obvious control failures where not only top executives but ultimately the Board is responsible 
Even worse  the report proves the board s negligence by indicating it had noticed a major deficiency  that control functions were reporting to unit profit center managers like Tolstedt  in 2013  yet was leisurely about addressing it  Keep in mind that is the same kind of deficient structure that led to the JP Morgan London Whale scandal 
It is a basic risk management failure to have control staff report to profit center managers 
The fact that the total hard dollar customer losses were small despite the brazenness and scale of the fraud was the big reason the former CEO thought he could brazen this out  And given that sanctimonious Wells had taken vastly more from customers via foreclosure abuses  this lackadaisical effort might have otherwise seemed reasonable 
After all  the traditional check on this kind of nickel and dime grifting  class action lawsuits  have become almost as rare as the dodo bird thanks to the successful efforts of Corporate America to cut them back 
Several prosecutors are supposedly still considering further action but don t expect much  Whistle blower retaliation claims and other types of wrongful termination suits could be affected to add up to more serious payouts  and even more important  continued media focus on Wells  bad conduct  Wells is not out of the woods  but sadly it is more likely to suffer the drip  drip  drip of individual cases than a prosecution or even a nice juicy civil suit against Stumpf or board members derelict in their duties 
And that is the problem   airlines can beat a passenger senseless and drag him like a slab of meat off the plane  banks can lie  steal and cheat   and in an extreme example  someone gets fired  they lose their multi million dollar bonus  and that is that  Nothing much more  Business as usual ",2017-04-12,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/business-as-usual-200182384,200182384
195113,416629,UAL,Asia Markets Seek Safe Havens,opinion,"The G 7 Nations acting like the League of Nations seems to have finally opened the floodgates as markets seek safe havens ahead of the Easter break 
As expected  in all honesty  the G 7 officials meeting about a recalcitrant Russia produced nothing new on the sanctions front  Talk of vested interests amongst the G 7 members is perhaps a bit harsh when cool heads should prevail  It did give an overall look of appeasement though  and this seems to have stirred the U S  markets into action with the theme of the session being seeking safe havens anywhere 
Gold rose 20 USD to 1275  U S 10 year yields fell below 2 30   and the USD JPY dropped 100 points and finally broken the crucial level at 110 00  Elsewhere the US Dollar Index pushed slightly lower  and the Korean Won fell to just shy of the psychological 1150 level 
The theme continues in Asia with equities generally in the red to start the session  Most notably the Nikkei 225 and KOSPI  Precious metals continue to be bid across the board  the U S  10 Year trades at 2 28  and both Brent and WTI have moved higher  Tensions in Europe  the Middle East and the Korean Peninsular have made the geopolitical situation more complicated than re writing the United Airlines Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  customer service manual 
As Easter approaches Asia  in particular  is focusing on this Easter Friday which is the anniversary of the birthday of the North Korean founder  Kim Il sung  The North would normally do  something  on this day  as is their want  This year  it s an almost global holiday  and given the present backdrop  it will have more poignancy  This should ensure that Asia remains solidly in a risk off mode for the rest of the week  come what may in other centres 
Looking at the markets in Asia today 
FX
USD JPY
The story of the night as repatriation flows turned to a deluge and USD JPY finally cracked the 110 00 level  The USD JPY continues to trade heavily in Asia with the Nikkei  However  those expecting a wholesale collapse may be disappointed as the USD JPY enters oversold territory on the RSI 
The 110 00 level is now resistance followed by 111 50 
Support appears initially at the 50  Fibonacci at 109 13 and then the 200 day moving average at 108 55

EUR JPY
It is reasonable to assume that every cross ending in XXX JPY didn t have a great night  EUR JPY being no exception with its 2nd consecutive close below its 200 day moving average  However  I do note that the cross is now very oversold on it RSI and Stochastic 
Resistance is at the top of its downward parallel channel at 117 80 which is also the area of the 200 day moving average  Initial support is around 80 points away at the bottom of the channel at 115 50  A breakout from here would set the
Initial support is around 80 points away at the bottom of the channel at 115 50  A breakout from here would set the scene technically for a move sub 114 00 

EUR JPY Daily
USD CNH
Quietly appreciated against the USD in the Asian session as the PBOC refrained from open market operations yet again  A slightly softer than expected CPI read of  0 3   M M saw a small reversal as the edge was taken of tightening expectations 
With USD CNH trading at 6 9020 as I write  the key levels continue to be 6 8400 and 6 9300 with the cross continuing to range 

PRECIOUS METALS
Gold
Precious metals were big movers overnight including gold  The 1 60  move higher to 1275 where we are now trading is significant because we have finally had a close above the 200 day moving average after failures all year 
Apart from being an obvious beneficiary of the delayed safe haven trade  from a technical perspective  the charts point to a move above 1300 now 
Support is clearly delineated at the 200 day moving average at 1257 50 and 1240 
Resistance is at the Asia session high of 1280 before a triple top from October at 1308  However  traders should keep an eye on the RSI and Stochastics for signs of bearish divergence 


Silver
Rose 2 40  in overnight trading to 18 3250 following gold as a safe haven darling  Asia has had another look at the upside to 18 4400 before falling back to roughly unchanged at 18 3250 
Silver has key resistance just above here at 18 4500 where it has failed multiple times  most recently last Friday  A close above clearly opens a technical move to 19 0000 on the charts 
Support meanwhile  lies at 18 0725 the 200 day moving average and then yesterday s lows at 17 9000 

ASIA INDICES
Nikkei 225
The Nikkei has fallen over 1 0  today as the large move up in the USD JPY saw exporter stocks sold  The ongoing situation with Toshiba Corp   T 6502  and its non endorsed accounts continues to weigh as well  with delisting a real possibility  The YEN appreciation on safe haven flows and a compressing of the US Japan yield spreads will continue to weigh on the index  The Nikkei continues to bump along its four month lows 
The Nikkei has intraday support at 18 585 with a daily close below suggesting a move to the next support around 18200  We have traded below this level today  but a recent bounce to 18626 means it is the daily close we must watch 
The Nikkei has resistance at 18945  Monday s high and then the 19145 19225 zone  the 100 and 200 day moving averages

SUMMARY
Global tensions and a rush to safety ruled the New York session  and this has followed through to Asia  The break of 110 in USD JPY is extremely significant  With a long weekend globally nearly upon us and further North Korea risk this Friday  the safety first theme is likely to continue ",2017-04-12,Jeffrey Halley,https://www.investing.com/analysis/asia-markets-seek-safe-havens-200182397,200182397
195114,416630,UAL,This Is Why Delta  DAL  Stock Surged Today,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   surged as much as 4 49  to  46 89 per share on Wednesday  and it was not the result of United Continental Holdings    NYSE UAL   overbooking scandal but the company s upbeat guidance from its 2017 first quarter earnings report 
The Georgia based airline company reported earnings of  0 77 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 73 per share  Revenues  however  fell short of expectations  coming in at  9 14 billion 
Delta s positive forecase for its fiscal 2017 second quarter  though  is what is keeping investors confident in the airline giant  Delta expects its passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  to grow 1  to 3  year over year and its operating margin to increase between 17  and 19  in the second quarter 
Revenue guidance included the impact from the April storm that recently hit Atlanta  The company estimated that the storm would probably  reduce its June quarter pre tax income by  125 million  as the company canceled around 4 000 flights due to the dangerous weather conditions and  subsequent operation recovery  
 Delta s 1Q17 earnings report and 2017 outlook is likely to be received well by investors   said Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth   Additionally  2Q17 PRASM guidance is in line to somewhat better than expectations  
Delta closed the day with 0 53  drop to  45 05 per share

195116,416632,UAL,United  UAL  To Refund 3411 Flight Passengers For Fiasco,opinion,The horrific incident on flight 3411 at Chicago s O Hare International Airport continues to haunt United Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    In a bid to make up for the misbehavior  the carrier has offered to refund all the 70 passengers on board the infamous flight  A Painful RecapOn Apr 9  a passenger  David Dao  a 69 year old doctor of Asian origin  on the overbooked flight 3411 was forcefully removed after he refused to voluntarily give up his seat and get off the plane  Given that the flight was overbooked and United Airlines needed to make room for four of its crew members  the carrier initially asked for volunteers from among the paid passengers to get off the plane    the carrier offered  400 per passenger as compensation and subsequently doubled the amount  However  the move failed to elicit any response from the passengers as no one was willing to evacuate his her seat  Subsequently  four passengers were randomly selected and asked to get off the jet  Three of these passengers got off  but the Kentucky based physician refused to oblige  citing his need to urgently reach destination due to professional requirements  However  his pleas went unanswered as aviation department police officers grabbed the man and dragged him down the aisle of the Kentucky bound flight  Currently  he is being treated at a Chicago hospital The incident  which was captured by fellow passengers on mobile and uploaded on social media  earned the carrier grave criticism from across the globe  The carrier was also alleged of racial discrimination  In fact  Dao was heard screaming that his Chinese origin was responsible for the inhumane treatment meted out to him Statements of Varying Emotions from the CEOUnited Continental s CEO Oscar Munoz has issued multiple statements ever since the passenger fiasco became public  In fact  his initial reaction in a letter to his employees on Apr 10  was anything but apologetic  He  said that the incident was  unfortunately compounded  and even referred to Dao as  disruptive and belligerent   Surprisingly  the carrier s shares gained on Apr 10 The incident  however  began to affect United Continental on Apr 11  as the world began to take greater notice of this barbaric incident  On Apr 11  the company s stock price fell 1 13  and as its market value dropped sharply  Moreover  the outrage in China as the video went viral is extremely unfavorable for United Continental as China is one of its key markets Following the stock s disappointing performance and the outrage  Munoz appeared to be more apologetic for the incident in his third response  The CEO called for an in depth review of the company s policies  particularly regarding overbooked flights  Results of the review are expected to be available by Apr 30 Subsequently  the CEO said in an that there will be no repetition of the incident in any United Continental flight  going forward  He also said that police officials will no longer be summoned to evacuate paid passengers  He even changed his stance about Dao when he admitted that was not at fault  virtually retracting his comment that the doctor was  disruptive and belligerent  Why the Decision to Refund Passengers In a bid to pacify the masses and prevent the stock from sliding further  the carrier announced that all passengers on the concerned flight would be provide a full refund  Passengers have the option to avail the compensation in cash  travel credits or miles United Continental is leaving no stone unturned to put an end to this sordid episode and shift the focus to its first quarter earnings report  scheduled for Apr 17  However  only time will tell how successful the carrier is in its efforts  We note that United Continental will be the second major carrier to release quarterly results this earnings cycle  Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL

195123,416639,UAL,Is United Continental A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  United Continental has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 60  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  United Continental s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Transportation  Airline industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 9 75  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should also point out that United Continental has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 25  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company s share price will likely appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  United Continental has a P S ratio of about 0 65  This is fairly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is around the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  United Continental is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  United Continental currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes United Continental a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 33  which is far better than the industry average of 4 88  Clearly  UAL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though United Continental might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives UAL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period This has also had an impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen substantially in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  United Continental Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineUnited Continental is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 22   and strong Zacks Rank  United Continental looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Transportation  Airline industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock

195124,416640,UAL,Gogo Stock Soars 17  On Strong Guidance After Turbulent 2016 Forced Innovation,opinion,"Gogo Inc    NASDAQ GOGO   just released its fourth quarter and full year financial results  and its stock skyrocketed 18 37  to  10 80 on Monday in early afternoon trading  Gogo beat both earnings and revenue estimates despite posting a  26 9 million fourth quarter loss  This quick upward climb comes as great news for the company since its stock had fallen 11  over the last 12 months 
The Chicago based company  which first began providing phone service for business flights in 1997  officially went public in June 2013  Gogo stock has slowly declined since Dec  2013 
But in the wake of a turbulent 2016  Gogo posted a better than expected fourth quarter and announced a positive outlook for the future 
Gogo posted an earnings loss of  0 34 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 46  Gogo reported revenue of  160 million  beating our estimate of  153 million and increasing 16  year over year 
Gogo reported full year 2016 revenue of  597 million but lost  1 58 per share overall  Still  the in flight internet provider expects to have a positive free cash flow in 2019  a full year earlier than it previously projected 
Turbulent 2016 
American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    one of its biggest airline partners  sued Gogo in Feb  2016 to break its contract because it felt Gogo offered an inferior product  American Airlines pointed to its competitor ViaSat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   as a better in flight Wi Fi provider 
The news caused Gogo  
 only a week later and Gogo rebounded a bit  In June  to provide Wi Fi for a new fleet of planes  Gogo still provides services to American Airlines 
For years  the company faced complaints about its slow internet service  But the American Airlines lawsuit might have helped propel the company forward because it prompted Gogo to install or upgraded more than 1 100 aircraft in 2016 
The Chicago based company had not conducted a substantial upgrade to its services since it first launched its in flight internet services in 2008  Gogo has raised its prices in recent years   The company currently offers in flight internet services ranging from  7 00 for one hour to  719 00 for a full year across multiple airlines 
Gogo announced plans to upgrade its 2Ku satellite broadband service in Summer 2016  The new service will be able to provide in flight Wi Fi at speeds upwards of 100 Mbps  Just last week  Gogo made its intentions for its 2Ku technology clear in a press release   There are now more than 100 2Ku aircraft flying with our first generation modem utilizing existing wide beam satellite technologies   CEO Michael Small said 
 Under these conditions  the technology is already delivering industry leading performance  With the new modem and HTS satellites  we are setting a very high bar for the industry  We are going to deliver this technology upgrade to our airline partners without needing to take an aircraft out of service  which is incredibly important for their operations  
Gogo announced its new upgraded modems will be installed starting in mid 2017  The proprietary features have increased throughput and reliability  And it will be installed in more than 1750 airplanes on 13 different Gogo supported airlines 
The upgraded speed promises users they will be able to stream video and live television through the company s new Gogo TV  which could prove to be vital going forward 
Gogo services  and controls roughly 80  of the in flight Wi Fi market  Air Canada   NYSE AC    Alaska Airlines   NYSE ALK    American Airlines  Delta   NYSE DAL    United   NYSE UAL   and Virgin America   DE VA   are all Gogo partners  The company provides in flight internet services to  
Overall  the company has partnerships with 16 commercial airlines and has pushed heavily into the Asian markets in the last few years 
Gogo provides services to Japan Airlines  Japan Transocean Air and Vietnam Airline  The company recently announced it had received approval to provide service to aircrafts flying in Chinese airspace  Gogo also began working with China Telecom Satellite 
The company announced in early Feb  it hired Patrick Carroll as regional president in Asia Pacific  APAC    As the growth of connected aviation in Asia Pacific expands  Gogo is committed to serving our airline partners in that region along with cultivating new growth opportunities for our 2Ku satellite technology in this market   COO John Wade said in a press release

195128,416644,UAL,Forget United  Buy These 3 Airline Stocks Instead,opinion,"Investor sentiment finally caught up to shares of United Continental   NYSE UAL   after video emerged online that showed a passenger being dragged off a Chicago Louisville flight  Shares are down about 4  in Tuesday morning trading  and the legacy carrier s  by more than  750 million so far to  21 8 billion 
United said four crew members needed to get to a flight departing from Louisville otherwise it would be canceled  and passengers were asked to voluntarily give up their seats  However  when no one volunteered  four passengers were then selected at random  including the man who was forcibly removed 
The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that the incident  was not in accordance with our standard operating procedure and the actions of the aviation security officer are obviously not condoned by the department  
United s CEO Oscar Munoz has stood by his decision to remove the man who refused to give up his seat on the overbooked flight  describing the passenger as  disruptive and belligerent  
Not United s First PR Mess
Just last month  United found themselves in another public relations disaster when the airline  two teenage girls from boarding a flight after a gate agent decided the leggings they were wearing were inappropriate  The incident was first reported by a fellow passenger on Twitter   NYSE TWTR    and subsequently went viral 
But the girls were apparently  pass travelers   a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis  leggings violated this specific dress code  since pass travelers are  representing  the airline 
Industry Outlook
Looking beyond United  the airline industry as a whole is looking hot right now  The International Air Transport Association  IATA  expects the global airline industry to bring in  30 billion in profits this year  with 4 billion projected travelers  The earnings represent a 4 1  net profit margin on top of total revenue of  736 billion 
Historically  airline stocks were and they still are a turbulent investment  closely tied to fluctuating oil prices  But during periods of low oil prices and steady economic growth  like the type of environment we re in now  airlines see their profits rise  Since 2014  U S  airline stocks as a group  almost 90  
Even Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   CEO Warren Buffet  who publicly denounced airline investments in the past  sees promise in the industry  Last year  the famous investor bought stakes in all four major U S  carriers  United  American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    Delta   NYSE DAL    and Southwest   NYSE LUV   
The  industry sits in the top 42  of all 265 industries ranked by the Zacks Industry Rank  While it s only gained 4 77  so far this year  the industry has pulled in solid returns over the last 1  3  and 5 years compared to the S P 500  Given this overall bullish sentiment  let s take a look at three airline stocks investors should consider 
SkyWest   NASDAQ SKYW   operates one of the larger regional airlines in the U S   and provides passenger and air freight services  While the carrier sits at a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  it boasts a VGM score of  A   SkyWest expects year over year earnings growth of 11 6  for the current year  and has an average earnings surprise of over 34   The airline has also beaten expectation in the past four consecutive quarters  In the past one year  SKYW has given a solid return of over 68  
Gol Linhas Aereas   NYSE GOL   provides regular and non regular flight transportation services for passengers  cargo  and mailbags in Brazil and internationally  The carrier is a  1  Strong Buy  on the Zacks Rank  and has a VGM score of  B   Shares of GOL have gained over 125  year to date  and over 365  in the past 12 months 
While Gol Linhas expects a year over year earnings decline of about 89  for the current quarter  the company has seen one positive estimate revision for the same time frame  Gol Linhas also has an average earnings surprise of over 52   and posted earnings beats in three of the past four quarters 
Alaska Air   NYSE ALK   provides passenger air  freight  and mail services within the state of Alaska and on the West Coast  The carrier is a  3  Hold  on the Zacks Rank  and has a VGM score of  B   Alaska Air became one of the first U S  airlines last year to return to unit revenue growth  with revenue per available seat mile  RASM  up 1 5  year over year 
For the current year  Alaska expects year over year earnings growth of 8 77  on top of year over year sales growth of 37 07  for the same period  The carrier has beaten expectations in the past four consecutive quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 5 5

195142,416658,UAL,Investors Brace For Storm Of Uncertainty Around Gold  Equities,opinion,"As Winter Storm Niko blanketed the Northeast in snow last week  disrupting scores of flights in the U S   airline executives convened in Washington to talk shop with President Donald Trump 
Back in November  I wrote that domestic carriers are likely to see the new president himself the former owner of the now defunct Trump Airlines as a strong partner in several key areas  Although a couple of airline CEOs have recently expressed strong opposition to some of Trump s protectionist immigration policies  Thursday  s meeting appeared to be constructive  with the president telling the group he would soon be announcing something  phenomenal in terms of tax and developing our aviation infrastructure  
Details of the tax plan  he said  would likely be announced sometime in the next two or three weeks  This rejuvenated some of the spirit that swept through the market soon after his election  reassuring investors that  would come sooner than expected 
Among other topics discussed at the meeting were the need for airport infrastructure improvements  industry deregulation  air traffic control and U S  carriers  competitive disadvantage to heavily subsidized Persian Gulf carriers  Three state owned Gulf carriers in particular have received as much as  50 billion in subsidies from Middle Eastern governments since 2004  which allow them  to operate without concern for turning a profit   according to a  addressed to Rex Tillerson  the new Secretary of State  and signed by three U S  airline CEOs  including Doug Parker of American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   Edward Bastian of Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  and Oscar Munoz of United Airlines  NYSE UAL  
U S  airlines  obviously  do not have the same privilege  putting them at a competitive disadvantage in the international market  Encouraging the Gulf states to end subsidization  as the CEOs hope  would be a huge win for domestic carriers and their workers 
The market seemed to like what it heard  as the NYSE ARCA Airline Index rallied close to 2 3 percent Thursday  This was the biggest one day move for the group in about a month  during which Trump s executive immigration ban grounded airline stocks 
The selloff following the executive order was overdone  I think  but it gave airline investors such as Warren Buffett an attractive buying opportunity 
Speaking of which  we learned last week that Buffett was convinced to bet big on the industry  reversing his famously negative opinion of the group  after being in attendance at one of Doug Parker s investor presentations last March  Parker told attendees that consolidation had fundamentally transformed the industry  making it efficient and focused on demand 
Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks
Airlines got another boost last week after a federal appeals court  in a unanimous decision  struck down Trump s travel ban  This prompted the president to tweet  SEE YOU IN COURT   presumably meaning the Supreme Court 
With respect to Trump  I m reminded of a statement former president George W  Bush made back in 2010  less than a year after leaving office   Here s what you learn   he said   You realize you re not it  You re part of something bigger than yourself   The buck might stop with the president  but the office is so much greater than one man 
This point was made by David Gergen  former advisor and senior official to a number of presidents  including Nixon  Ford and Reagan  He s now a CNN political analyst  and it was my pleasure to hear him speak at Harvard recently  Trump is learning the hard way  Gergen said  that the Office of the President cannot be run like the Trump Organization  or any other private company  In public office  there are checks and balances  and there s blindingly harsh transparency all of which the billionaire president  aged 70  has never had to deal with 
Trump ran largely on his dealmaking expertise  and I m still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he can negotiate good deals for the U S  But it s important to remember that successful deals  in business and in government  often can t occur without a judicious amount of compromise  If he truly believes in the value and necessity of imposing a temporary immigration ban on seven mostly Muslim countries  his administration will need to go about it in a way that pleases the courts 
But then  none of us should be surprised if he insists on the ban in its current form   My style of dealmaking is quite simple and straightforward   he wrote 30 years ago in Art of the Deal   I aim very high  and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I m after  
Hedge Fund Managers Sound Off
Meanwhile  the president s unpredictability and Twitter outbursts has inevitably engendered quite a lot of market uncertainty  which  as you know  investors don t like  This has prompted several big name hedge fund managers to weigh in 
One such manager is value investor Seth Klarman  who oversees  30 billion as head of Boston based Baupost Group  He tends to be media shy  but Klarman is no slouch  In the last 34 years  he s lost money in only three  He s one of the very few money managers to receive open praise from Buffett himself 
Anyway  in his annual letter to investors  Klarman raised concerns that Trump s protectionist policies and deep tax cuts could seriously hamper economic growth  both domestically and abroad  by isolating the U S  from global trade and adding significantly to the already bloated national debt 
 Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts  while mostly ignoring the risks from America first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers   he wrote  You can read more of Klarman s letter over at Andrew Ross Sorkin s 
Managers at hedge fund firm Carlson Capital  which controls over  8 billion  share many of the same concerns  telling investors recently that Trump s trade policies could  cause a global depression and a major equity market decline  
Even for some money managers who were initially excited by Trump Ray Dalio and Jeff Gundlach among them reality is beginning to set in 
Gold Gains on Uncertainty
Last year  central bank policy and negative real interest rates drove the gold rally  This year  it seems to be uncertainty over Trump and  which is convincing the smart money to make wagers on the yellow metal  often seen as a safe haven during shaky times 
So far in 2017  it s up close to 7 percent  compared to the S P 500 s 2 6 percent  In fact  if you compare this year s price action to last year s  they look remarkably the same  with a dip in December before the Federal Reserve raised rates  Although past performance is no guarantee of future results  gold could gain another  100 an ounce this year if it continues to follow the same trajectory 

Among those who are bullish on the yellow metal is Stanley Druckenmiller  the legendary hedge fund manager who dumped his gold the same day he learned Trump had been elected  Before that  it was the number one holding in his family office account 
Now he s back  telling Bloomberg he  wanted to own some currency and no country wants its currency to strengthen  Gold was down a lot  so I bought it  
Higher demand has been good for both junior and senior gold miners  which recently crossed above their 200 day moving averages 

The NYSE ARCA Gold Miners Index was up for an incredible seven straight days ended Monday  while the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners has made positive gains in eight of the nine previous days 
Germany Brings Home More of Its Gold
Hedge fund managers aren t the only ones whose demand for gold is strong  For the sixth straight year  central banks continued to be net importers of the metal in 2016  with China  Russia and Kazakhstan leading world consumption 
Although it might not have purchased any gold in 2016  the Deutsche Bundesbank  Germany s central bank  ramped up its repatriation program  bringing home some 216 metric tons from vaults in New York  according to the Wall Street Journal  In 2011  former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke said central banks held gold simply because it s tradition 
I think the reason goes much deeper than that  Gold is money it has been ever since the first gold currency appeared in China more than 3 000 years ago and Germany s efforts are proof of that

195143,416659,UAL,Gold Gets Shot In The Arm From Inflation  China,opinion,"Inflation just got another jolt  rising as much as 2 5 percent year over year in January  the highest such rate since March 2012  Led by higher gasoline  rent and health care costs  consumer prices have now advanced for the sixth straight month  In addition  January is the second straight month for rates to be above the Federal Reserve s target of 2 percent 
Air fares are also climbing  and speaking of air fares  billionaire investor Warren Buffett added to his domestic airline holdings  we learned last week  Buffett s holding company  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   is now the second largest holder of American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   with an 8 79 percent share of the company  It also increased its holdings in Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  by over 800 percent  to 60 million shares  The company now owns 43 2 million shares of Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   and it increased its stake in United Continental  NYSE UAL  to about 28 million shares 
A March rate hike now looks all but imminent  Many economists including those at Goldman Sachs  I had the pleasure to hear speak this week expect to see at least three such hikes this year alone 

Gold responded accordingly  closing above  1 240 for the first time since soon after the November election  Below you can see the gold price charted against the inflation adjusted 10 year Treasury yield  which is now in subzero territory 

The question I have is  Why would an investor deliberately choose to lose money  But that s precisely what s happening now with inflation where it is 
These were among some of the topics addressed by former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan  who spoke with the World Gold Council  WGC  for the winter edition of its 

 Significant increases in inflation will ultimately increase the price of gold   Greenspan said   Investment in gold now is insurance  It s not for short term gain  but for long term protection  

He also reiterated his view  which I share  that gold is much more than just a metal but a currency  I view gold as the primary global currency  It is the only currency  along with silver  that does not require a counterparty signature  Gold  however  has always been far more valuable per ounce than silver 
No one refuses gold as payment to discharge an obligation  Credit instruments and fiat currency depend on the credit worthiness of a counterparty  Gold  along with silver  is one of the only currencies that has an intrinsic value  It has always been that way  No one questions its value  and it has always been a valuable commodity  first coined in Asia Minor in 600 BC 
Although major stock indices continue to hit fresh all time highs on hopes of tax reform and fiscal stimulus  it s important to temper the exuberance with a little prudence  The bull market  currently in its eighth year  is facing some significant geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty  and we could be getting late in the economic cycle  This makes gold s investment case even more attractive  For the 10 year period  the yellow metal has shown an inverse correlation to risk assets such as stocks and high yield bonds  It might be time to ensure that your portfolio has the recommended 10 percent in gold that includes 5 percent in gold coins and jewelry  the other 5 percent in quality gold equities and mutual funds 
China and India to Lead World Economy by 2050
The long term investment case for gold looks just as compelling following bullish reports last week from PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  and Morgan Stanley   China and India are the world s top two consumers of gold  and both countries are expected to make huge economic gains in the next few decades  This is likely to boost gold demand even more  which has a high correlation with discretionary income growth 
China alone consumed approximately 2 000 metric tons in 2016  or roughly  of all the new gold that was mined during the year  according to veteran mining commentator Lawrie Williams  who based his estimates on calculations made by BullionStar s Koos Jansen  The 2 000 metric tons is a much higher figure than what analysts and the media have been telling us  but I ve always suspected China s annual consumption to run higher than  official  numbers 
According to PwC s models  China and India should become the world s number one and number two largest economies by 2050 based on purchasing power parity  PPP   China  of course  is already the largest economy by that measure  but PwC sees the Asian giant surpassing the U S  economy on an absolute basis by as early as 2030 
As for India  it  currently comprises 7 percent of world GDP at PPP  which we project to rise steadily to over 15 percent by 2050   PwC writes   This is a remarkable increase of 8 percentage points  gaining the most ground of any of the countries we modeled  
I think it s also worth highlighting Indonesia  which is expected to replace Japan as the fourth largest economy by midcentury  E7 economies  in fact  could end up dominating the top 10  with Mexico moving up to number seven and France dropping off  You can see the full list 
China Set to Become High Income Nation by 2027
Then there s Morgan Stanley s 118 page report   Why we are bullish on China   The investment bank sees a number of dramatic changes over the coming years  the most significant being China s transition from a middle income nation to a prosperous  high income nation sometime between 2024 and 2027   The high income threshold is a gross national income  GNI  of around  12 500 per capita   This would make China one of only three countries with populations over 20 million that have managed to accomplish this feat in the past 30 years  the other two being South Korea and Poland 

This trajectory is supported by a number of expectations  including  most importantly  Morgan Stanley s confidence that China will manage to avoid a debt related financial crisis  as some investors might now believe is forthcoming  The bank s view is that the Chinese government will successfully provide  adequate policy buffers and deft management of the policy cycle  to ensure the growth of per capita incomes 
Other key transitions will additionally need to take place for the country to reach high income status by 2027  including transitioning from a high investment economic model to high consumption and implementing meaningful state owned enterprise reform  Although China is currently transitioning from a manufacturing economy to one that s focused on consumption and services  the country will also need to emphasize high value added manufacturing 

In addition  since President Donald Trump has officially withdrawn the U S  from the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP   China could very well use this as an opportunity to take the lead in global trade  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  writes  This view aligns with comments I ve previously made  China is already reportedly weighing its options with two alternative free trade agreements  FTAs   one that includes the U S   the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific  and one that does not  the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership  
It s probably safe to say  however  that given Trump s opposition to FTAs  trade negotiations involving the U S  are unlikely to happen anytime soon 
Investors Underweight China
 Taken together  this is all good news for gold  Again  when incomes rise in China and India  gold demand has historically benefited 
But it also makes China a compelling place to invest in  And yet investors have tended to be shy  underweighting the country for at least a decade in relation to the broader emerging markets universe

195151,416667,UAL,IATA Unveils Tepid 2017 Profit Forecast On Rising Oil Prices,opinion,"The International Air Transport Association  IATA  has provided a lackluster view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2017  The research firm predicts global net profit for the industry of  29 8 billion  This is much lower than the 2016 profitability forecast of  35 6 billion  The gloomy projection may be attributed to the anticipation of rising oil prices 
In fact  IATA has not only issued a disappointing 2017 outlook  but the forecast for 2016 profitability has been trimmed as well   The organization now expects the industry to end the current year with global net profit of  35 6 billion as against  39 4 billion predicted in June 
2017 Forecast
The bulk of the global profits   18 1 billion  is expected from the North American region  However  the estimated figure is lower than  20 3 billion expected in 2016  The North American region  which boasts carriers like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK   and Hawaiian Holdings   NASDAQ HA    is likely to witness an average profit of  19 58 per passenger and net margin of 8 5  in 2017 
Traffic is expected to grow at 2 5   a tad below the projected capacity expansion of 2 6   We note that Hawaiian Holdings sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
The other regions  such as Europe  the Asia Pacific  Latin America and the Middle East are expected to generate post tax net profit of  5 6 billion   6 3 billion   0 2 billion and  0 3 billion  respectively  The expected 2017 profitability of each region is lower than the 2016 estimate  African carriers too are expected to continue their dismal performance in 2017 due to losses of approximately  0 8 billion Transportation   Airline Industry Price Index
 

Global net profit margin is expected to shrink to 4 1  in 2017 from the 2016 estimate of 5 1   The top line is projected to come in at  736 billion next year  with cargo revenues projected to increase slightly to  49 4 billion  Cargo demand is expected to grow to 3 5   with cargo industry volumes touching record highs of 55 7 million tons  53 9 million tons expected in 2016  
According to the forecast   air travel growth of 5 1  is expected in 2017 compared with 5 9  growth this year  Capacity is projected to rise by 5 6  in 2017 as against 6 2  increase projected in 2016  According to the forecast  load factor  percentage of seats filled by passengers  for 2017 is expected to decline 40 basis points to 79 8  as capacity expansion is likely to outweigh traffic growth  According to the report  yields are expected to stabilize for both cargo and passenger operations 
The research firm has also predicted that airline companies will retain  7 54 per passenger in 2017  The firm projects that jet fuel prices are likely to escalate around 24 6  to  64 9 per barrel next year 
We note that there is an inverse relation between crude prices and the value of aviation stocks  Naturally  rise in oil prices is unfavorable for carriers as it will result in significantly higher operating expenses  This is because fuel costs represent a significant chunk of the total expenses for airline companies 
The recent decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  or OPEC  to cut oil production has prompted a surge in oil prices  The move aims to trim output to 32 5 million barrels per day  Oil prices are likely to continue their upward march in 2017  contributing to the tepid view for airlines

195152,416668,UAL,Mere Mortals  Leave Airline Investing To Buffett ,opinion,"Do not get us wrong  this is not a critique of Warren Buffett s judgement  Who are we to criticize him  after all 
In November  Berkshire Hathaway s SEC filings revealed that the company has opened positions in four major U S  airlines   American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   United Continental Holdings  NYSE UAL   Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV   However  in our opinion  investors should not blindly follow anyone  not even the greatest investor of all time  And Buffett is the ultimate long term investor 
Among other things  he is famous for saying that his  favorite holding period is forever   So  if you are not ready to follow this mantra  you should not be copying him  For example  Buffett is not worried if a major market correction is going to occur  Unfortunately  for mere mortals like us  holding a stock through a bear market could be a problem  And if the Elliott Wave analysis of the two airline indices shown below is correct  holding airline stocks is not a very good idea right now 
As visible  the monthly charts of the U S  Airlines Index  DSAR  and the Airline Index NY  XAL  look strikingly similar  Both of them bottomed out in March  2009  Both have been rising ever since  And both have been drawing a five wave impulse to the north during the last 8 years  which is precisely why you might be better off without airline stocks in your portfolio  According to the Wave Principle  every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  This means that once the fifth waves in both indices end  a significant decline to the support area of wave 4 should follow  In terms of price  this translates into 170 for DSAR and 70 for XAL  The relative strength index also supports the negative outlook by showing a bearish divergence between waves 3 and 5 on both charts 
Turns out  airline indices might lose 30  40  from now on  If you are not planning to own such stocks forever  why own them now ",2016-12-14,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mere-mortals-should-leave-airlines-to-buffett-200169720,200169720
195153,416669,UAL,Here s Why Warren Buffett Likes Airlines Again,opinion,"Last month we learned that Warren Buffett bought shares of American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  and United Continental Holdings  NYSE UAL   according to Berkshire Hathaway s  NYSE BRKa  third quarter regulatory filings  He also confirmed that he purchased Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  stock as well 
If we look at the Dow Jones U S  Airlines Index year to date  these allocations appear to have been well timed 

Buffett is universally recognized as one of the most influential investors of all time  so his decision to book a flight on airlines  after blasting the industry for years  is worth examining more closely 
Protected by an Economic Moat
We ll mention a couple of things upfront  Most everyone knows Buffett is a value investor  He seeks equity in companies that the market has undervalued including airlines  As I ve pointed out before  if we use price to earnings as our valuation metric  airlines are among the least expensive in the industrials sector 
He also likes companies that are protected by what he calls a  moat   the  something  that prevents new competitors from disrupting the industry  giving the veteran players a clear advantage in the marketplace  This is why Buffett has always been attracted to railroads  Because rail is prohibitively capital intensive  the barriers to entry are high and competition is limited  giving companies greater market power 
We see a similar moat protecting U S  airlines  Since the industry consolidated a decade ago after a wave of bankruptcies  a vast majority of the market share is now concentrated in the big four carriers  In 2015  American  Delta  United and Southwest controlled about 77 percent of U S  airline revenue 
These are pretty high level factors to consider  When we delve deeper into the factors Buffett uses to assess equities  the airlines group becomes even more attractive 
Airlines Crushed the Broader Market
What you see below are the top 10 U S  airlines compared to the S P 500 Index  using four of Buffett s favorite financial metrics  return on equity  cash flow return on invested capital  net income margin and free cash flow per share  As of the third quarter  the airlines group trounced the broader market in all four areas for the 12 month period  This might have contributed to Buffett s decision to rotate back into a space he spent a couple of decades deriding 

You can find the definitions of these factors on Investopedia  but they re pretty self explanatory 
Return on equity  ROE  measures how much profit a company generates with shareholders  money  Whereas the S P 500 returned about 14 percent during the 12 month period  airlines returned 36 percent of equity 
Cash flow return on invested capital  CFROIC  tells investors how much cash flow a company produces as a percentage of its total capital  CFROIC was 35 60 percent for carriers  14 90 percent for blue chip stocks 
Net income margin  simply put  is the percent difference between a company s sales and its net profits  In the past  airlines were notorious for having razor thin margins  That s all changed thanks to industry consolidation  restructuring of businesses and the addition of new revenue streams  The top 10 airlines saw margins of more than 12 percent  while S P 500 margins were 9 8 percent 
Finally  free cash flow per share is exactly what it sounds like  It s sometimes used as a proxy for earnings per share  but it specifically measures a company s ability to pay back loans  taxes and other expenses on a per share basis  Airlines beat the S P 500   4 1 per share to  3 3 per share 
Airlines have definitely come a long way since Buffett invested in and lost money on US Airways back in 1989

United s ROIC does not look highly attractive when compared to its publicly traded peer group  Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK   Delta Air Lines  Inc  NYSE DAL   Southwest Airlines Co  NYSE LUV  and American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL   The company s ROIC of 13 3  is slightly above AAL  13 1   and below ALK  20 6    DAL  23 8    and LUV  21 2   
These return figures  in part  help explain why the company s  trade at a discount to this same comparable company group 
United s forward EBITDA multiple of 4 1x is well below all of its peers  ALK  5 6x   DAL  4 7x   LUV  6 1x   and AAL  4 8x  
However  note how the airline s returns have generally improved since its 2008 low of  30   Compare this to United s fiscal year 2015 ROIC of 18    a big improvement 
The company s financial performance has improved over the last several years and is expected to continue improving 
When inputting consensus Wall Street projections into finbox io s various discounted cash flow  DCF  analyses and   United appears to be fundamentally undervalued 
The chart below compares our calculated margin of safety for each peer company vs Wall Street s 
Note how Wall Street s generally bullish on this entire airline group  However  our unbiased analyses concludes that only United and American Airlines are materially undervalued 
Furthermore  just this morning S P Capital IQ reiterated its Buy rating on United and noted its positive fundamental outlook on the US airline industry  The research firm believes that

195171,416687,UAL,Like Buffett  Why You Should Find Value In Airline ETF,opinion,"Who doesn t want to invest likethe Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha or Warren Buffett  After all  this Wall Street guru has successfully put his money in the right place and continues to reap huge returns  Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa   is up about 19  so far this year  as of November 16  2016  and added over 115  in the last five years compared to the S P 500 s 6 5  gains this year and an 87 9  five year return 
Following an investor of this aptitude will surely be anybody s dream  Normally  Buffett takes interest in companies trading below what he believes is their intrinsic value  He aims long term outperformance and apparently ignores short term downturns 
Probably this is why this investment veteran recently picked up some  that are currently overlooked by investors  The sector is in the bottom 39  of the Zacks Industry Rank at the time of this writing  read    
The stocks that Buffett bought are American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    Delta Airlines   NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings Inc    NYSE UAL    As per sources  Buffett also bought     NYSE LUV   recently 
Why Buffett Catches Airlines 
This shows a tectonic shift in preference as Buffet has stayed away from airline stocks for long  But the latest surge in interest can be credited to a decent level of share buybacks by airlines  as per   The industry s profitability and efficiency ratios have also improved in recent times  barring some exceptions 
In the latest reporting cycle too  the beat ratios show that the corporate strength in the airlines industry is not as bleak as the stock trend  Plus  most of the airlines are restraining   which should improve unit revenues  read    
Investors should also note that UAL  AAL and DAL carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  each with a VGM score of A  which is a combination of value  growth and momentum characteristics  The trio especially has a Value score of  A   Though LUV is not in our favored list with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   it still has a VGM score of B with the same value score  Since Buffet is a fan of value investing  his sudden interest in airline stocks is self explanatory 
Below we elucidate how cheap these four stocks are compared to the air transportation industry and the S P 500 using various valuation metrics 

If these were not enough  airlines expect a 2 5  surge in travelers in the thanksgiving weekend and accordingly beefed up the number of flights and seats  All in all  investors intending to follow Buffett s latest move on airlines stocks and having faith in the industry fundamentals may find U S  Global Jets ETF  an intriguing choice  see   
JETS in FocusThe  49 7 million fund holds over 34 stocks in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities  United Continental  13 26    Delta Airlines  13 11    Southwest Airlines  12 78   and American Airlines  12 61   are the top four elements in the basket  The product charges 60 bps in fees  The fund gained about 5 2  in the last five trading sessions  as of November 17  2016

The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share for  1 66 on  10 61 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and about in line on the top 
Delta expects key PRASM metrics to fall 7  with 1  coming by way of the August outage that resulted in 2 000 flight cancellation
The airline industry  Delta included  has faced significant headwinds including foreign currency pressure  mounting terrorist threat  weaker business flight demand  and increasing competition
Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  is the first of the airlines to report this earnings season and will kick things off Thursday afternoon  Its scheduled third quarter report is expected to set the tone for major airlines like United Continental  NYSE UAL  and American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL   which take the stage the following week  It appears as if Delta s troubles won t be easing with tomorrow s report  Early signs are pointing to a continued slowdown on the top and bottom line 
Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of  1 66  down 4  compared to the same period last year  That estimate has declined 5  since Delta s most recent report in July  Revenue for the period is anticipated 4  lower to  10 61 billion  marking a 5th consecutive quarter of negative sales growth  Investors can take comfort that the stock typically pops 1 5  in the 30 days following an earnings report 

Major airlines have faced significant headwinds lately from foreign currency pressures  mounting terrorist threats  weaker last minute business flights and a simple reluctance to fly  Delta  in particular  has seen both revenue and earnings decline as a result  Last quarter printed a 16  jump on the bottom line  down from 193  the quarter prior  and a 2  decline on the top  Passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM   the key metric all airlines are measured by  fell 4 9   These ongoing woes have played a role in share prices falling 22 5  this year 
The above issues are likely to play a role in Thursday s pivotal report  Meanwhile  Delta is expected to see pricing pressure due to the highly competitive market  Low budget airlines such as Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  and Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ SAVE  have captured greater market share through a more consumer friendly pricing model  Delta has already indicated that Q3 PRASM could decline by as much as 7   with 1  coming from the outage it experienced in August  The disruption resulted in more than 2 000 flight cancellations and just as many refunds 
On a positive note  Delta will start flight services to Cuba  which is expected to provide the airline with a much needed source of revenue  Delta also indicated that traffic figures for September 2016 were impressive  Any indication that Q4 guidance could be lifted is sure to put a smile on shareholders  faces ",2016-10-12,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-airline-stock-won’t-take-off-after-its-earnings-report-200158331,200158331

195213,416729,UAL,Forget American Airlines  Buy These 4 Airline Stocks Instead,opinion,"Fort Worth  TX based American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   with market capitalization of  18 63 billion is among the most well known players in the U S  airline industry  However  the carrier  like most of its peers in the airline space  is facing tough times 
Recently  the carrier fell out of favor as far as Raymond James is concerned  Analysts at the firm downgraded the stock to  Market Perform  from  Outperform  on valuation concerns  The downgrade contributed to the stock losing value on Sep 21 and closing at  34 67  
Opinions of broker s  analysts on a particular stock serve as an important pointer for investors  Analysts attend company conference calls presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  Naturally  more often than not investors pay heed to such well researched information  Hence  it comes as no surprise that the stock plunged 1 37  following the downgrade 
Why the Downgrade 
Analysts at Raymond James believe that American Airlines is more expensive compared to its peers Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    Given the challenges that American Airlines is currently facing  this expensive valuation is not justified  Analysts are also concerned about the carrier s balance sheet  which is weaker than its abovementioned peers 
American Airlines exited the second quarter of 2016 with a debt to capitalization ratio in excess of 83   which is very concerning  The ratio for Delta Air Lines and United Continental at the end of the second quarter were much lower  36 2  and 56   respectively 
Raymond James analysts believe that the recent pay related deal of American Airlines with its mechanics might serve as a dampener to its profits in the short term  Moreover  they expect the carrier to reduce its annual buyback levels in 2019 due to an increase in costs associated with debt repayment  pension payments and others  This is likely to hurt the carrier s performance in the long run 
Apart from the downgrade  American Airlines faces other headwinds like the surge in terrorism and unit revenue issues to name a few  Moreover  American Airlines has a significant exposure to UK  This makes it highly vulnerable to the Brexit induced uncertainty 
Given this backdrop  it is best to look elsewhere in the airline space for better investment opportunities  We note that American Airlines is not a Buy rated firm according to the Zacks methodology either  The carrier currently carries a Zacks Rank   3  Hold  
How to Identify the Outperformers 
The airlines industry is deeply entrenched in a bearish territory  as evidenced by the Zacks industry rank of 184  out of more than 260 groups  carried by the Transportation Airline segment  Hence  it is by no means an easy task to arrive at winning stocks in the space 
Though it is a daunting task to find the most attractive picks at the moment  Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy

195222,416738,UAL,3 Airline Stocks To Buy Despite Headwinds,opinion,"The second quarter 2016 earnings season has ended for airline companies  Although quite a few companies in the space including key players like Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL    American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings  Inc    NYSE UAL   delivered better than expected earnings  the fact remains that the sector is plagued with multiple headwinds 
Headwinds Overshadow Earnings Beats
The sector is amid severe stress at the moment and it is evident from the fact that despite the earnings outperformance  stock prices of the companies have remained passive  For example  Delta  in spite of the bottom line outperformance  continues to carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and has seen its stock price go down by over 11  since its earnings release on Jul 14 
The headwinds vary greatly  from the surge in terror attacks  uncertainty following the Brexit vote in June  unit revenue issues  technical glitches to name a few  The unfortunate escalation in the frequency of terror attacks has affected airline stocks massively due to the associated security fears resulting in a decrease of air travel demand  Additionally declining ticket prices too have the potential to hurt revenues of carriers 
Moreover  the Brexit vote and the subsequent uncertainty put airline stocks at risk  particularly those with considerable exposure to the U K  due to fears related to slackening demand for business travel  The aftermath of the Brexit vote are well exhibited by the projection of Lufthansa   OTC DLAKY    another Zacks Rank  5 airline stock  that travel demand to Europe has been waning following multiple terror attacks and the uncertainty following the Brexit vote  The German carrier also stated that advance bookings  especially on long haul Europe bound routes  have been impacted 
Apart from the abovementioned issues  unit revenue related problems continue to hurt stocks in the space with very little signs of any respite  Furthermore  computer glitches have also proved to be a nuisance disrupting operations and causing undue harassments to passengers  
The headwinds are well displayed by the fact that the NYSE ARCA Airline index has declined over the past six months  The Zacks Industry rank of 244  among 260  groups  carried by the Transportation Airline segment is further evidence of the tough times being endured by the stocks in the space  In view of this gloomy backdrop  it is no surprise that the bottom line outperformaces for carriers have failed to find favor among the investors 
Some Tailwinds Remain
Despite the challenges enveloping the space  we highlight some positives for investors interested in the sector  Cheap oil has been a huge benefactor for airline stocks for quite some time  Cheap oil has aided the bottom line of carriers significantly in the form of huge savings  This has strengthened carriers  balance sheets leading to increased investments aimed at improving flying experience of passengers apart from hiking dividend payouts buybacks along with profit sharing payments 
Although oil prices have been weak for quite some time  since mid 2014  and consequently have been priced in  this major tailwind continues to be the main factor behind the considerable year over year earnings growth for carriers  Currently  oil prices are hovering around the  45 a barrel mark  a long way off the  100  a barrel witnessed two years ago  With oil prices not anticipated to touch the highs of mid 2014 anytime soon  this factor will continue to aid carriers  bottom lines going forward 
The bullish  by the International Air Transport Association for the airlines industry for the full year 2016 is also driven by the assumption of weak oil prices  Moreover  Airlines for America expects that U S  carriers will make hay in the upcoming Labor Day holiday period  Aug 31   Sep 6  with travel demand projected to increase 4  on the back of low air fares 
We are also positive on the U S  Department of Transportation s decision to allow major US  based carriers to operate flights to Cuban cities  Once operational  the top line of the concerned carriers will be benefitted immensely due to new route additions as Cuba is a favorite tourist spot 
How to Pick Winners 
The above commentary clearly reflects that despite headwinds all is not lost for airline stocks and there exists few hidden gems in the space which investors can unearth  The stocks have the potential to generate handsome returns 
However  given the vastness of the airline space and with most stocks struggling  it is by no means an easy task to identify the few bright spots  We have utilized our   to pinpoint such stocks  The   which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy 
Our Choices

Skywest Inc    NASDAQ SKYW    headquartered at St  George  UT  operates as one of the major regional airlines in the U S  SkyWest reported impressive numbers for the second quarter 2016  comfortably beating both the earnings and revenue estimates  The carrier holds a Zacks Rank  2  The forward P E ratio for the current financial year is 10 54  The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved 4 7  to  2 65 per share over the last 30 days

195223,416739,UAL,LA City Council OKs Delta s  1 9B LAX Modernization Plans,opinion,"Good news flowed in at the Atlanta  GA based Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   regarding its efforts to modernize its terminals at the Los Angeles International Airport  LAX   The airline behemoth s lease and license agreement to relocate to terminals 2 and 3 from terminals 5 and 6 at the airport received approval from Los Angeles City Council  The carrier plans to invest  1 9 billion for the upgradation purpose  The agreement aims at expanding Delta s gates at this key hub 
The sanction marks a huge step toward fulfilling Delta s aim to upgrade its facilities at the busy airport where it has grown considerably over the years  An extent of its growth at LAX can be measured from the fact that departures  on a daily basis  are currently in excess of 175 compared to 70 in 2009  By relocating to terminals 2 and 3  Delta aspires to carve out  a premier space  for its operations at the busy airport along with its partners in the airline space like Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia DELTA AIR LINES Price
 

   The  1 9 billion plan has already gained authorization from Los Angeles World Airports  Board of Airport Commissioners  The City Council s approval has removed a big hurdle as far as the materialization of Delta s plan is concerned 
An environmental impact review process will now take place  In the event of Delta succeeding in its efforts to modernize its LAX operations  passengers will be the greatest benefactors and it will pave the way for Delta in becoming a dominant carrier at LAX   In fact  Delta is not the only carrier looking to expand at LAX  Earlier this year  American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   had announced its expansion plans at LAX 
Apart from Delta and American Airlines  almost all major US carriers including United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   operate at LAX   Consequently  we expect investor focus to remain on updates regarding Delta s efforts to beat the competition and become a dominant player at LAX 
We note that carriers are making huge investments for infrastructural developments driven by cheap oil  Soft oil prices have resulted in huge savings for carriers thereby improving their financial status tremendously

American Midstream Partners LP  NYSE AMID  had a very good day on Tuesday  Looking at the long term chart  you ll see that AMID got whacked in 2014  going from 32  all the way down to the 2016 low at 4 00 
It then recovered after forming a wedge  coiling type base pattern  moved up sharply in April  consolidated for several months  and on Tuesday it popped 1 00  or 8 1 4   to 13 10  on 3 million shares traded 
That s really good volume for this stock  and the biggest day I ve ever seen on an up day  with an almost vertical OBV going straight up  It took out resistance  and has some work to do by taking out 14  If it does get through that  the targets are 16  and perhaps the high teens  low 20 s eventually 
BroadSoft Inc  NASDAQ BSFT  had a big day  a nice day  on Tuesday  up 1 41  or 3   to 46 27  on 484 351 shares traded  It took out a little bit of resistance here  and may be headed for a test of the all time highs at 47 1 2 near term  which may happen on Wednesday 
Then it has the top of the channel at 48 1 2 49  Ultimately  mid 50 s may be doable  or even something much higher than that  For now  though  you can see the rising channel  increasing OBV  and increasing volume as well  It has 6 37 days to cover 
LeMaitre Vascular Inc  NASDAQ LMAT   a swing trade of ours is looking good  It has a breakaway gap  formed a beautiful flag  held the prior highs  and it s been up for three days in a row  On Tuesday  it popped 42 cents  or 2 3   to 18 46  on 190 103 shares traded  For targets I am looking at 21  and then high 20 s beyond that to 28 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ RIGL  with some big drug news on Tuesday  exploded 1 20  or 48 86   to 3 93  on a whopping 59 569 million shares traded  That s unheard of volume  and has never been anywhere near that before Tuesday 
More importantly  it closed at the upper end of the range  which I find very positive  Despite the fact  it came off the 4 06 high  it finished at 3 93  That s really good performance  I would not be surprised to see more upside on Wednesday that gets this upward of 4 40  and then I m looking at 5 00

195232,416748,UAL,Here s Why American Airlines  AAL  Stock Is Popping Today,opinion,"On Friday  shares of legacy airline American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL   are popping  up almost 3  in late afternoon trading after the company announced it has reached a deal with 30 000 ground employees that  according to unions  will increase pay by an average of 22  
However  this has added  75 million to the company s pre tax costs in its third quarter  and  120 million in the fourth quarter 
Working with the TWU IAM Association  the deal covers 12 organized worker s groups in maintenance  fleet service  and other ground services    negotiators said the deal has made American s compensation comparable or even slightly ahead of positions at top rivals United Continental   NYSE UAL   and Delta Airlines   NYSE DAL   
 Association members at American Airlines will receive the industry best wages they deserve now   said Association Chair and Vice Chair Sito Pantoja and Harry Lombardo  respectively   The process of bargaining joint contracts after a mega airline merger like American and US Airways is complex and time consuming  Association members will not have to wait to share appropriately in the success of their airline while their Negotiating Committees bargain hard to complete the process  
The pay raises will go into effect immediately  Union negotiators are continuing to argue for a bargaining agreement for the association  as they represent roughly a third of American s total workforce 
In their own   American elaborated on the pay increases  saying maintenance and related workers will receive a raise of 15  36   fleet service employees will get 24   tower planners will get 31   and weight and balance planners will get 55  
 We are pleased to reach this innovative and unprecedented agreement   American Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom   Today s interim agreement is unique  and thanks to the experienced leadership of Association Chair Sito Pantoja  Association Vice Chair Harry Lombardo  and two extremely motivated and capable negotiating committees  we have joined together to put the interests of our co workers and Association members first  We will continue to work toward a single agreement that accommodates the unique needs of each of these diverse groups  and remain committed to reaching that single agreement as quickly as we can

United Airlines  the Chicago based unit of the company  has gone through a turbulent few months owing to labor issues  macroeconomic woes and staggering demand  Also  the company s challenges seem to be increasing  It will be paying fine related to an issue with a Newark flight  The company will however not be charged for it  The company had reached a tentative agreement on a labor contract for which voting is currently underway  Scheduled to close on Aug 12  a negative result could put operational efficiency in disarray 
In addition to internal issues  the global rise in terrorism has been a key reason behind plunging airline stock prices  Recent incidents of terrorism  such as the Bastille Day attack in Nice  France as well as the caf  attack in Dhaka have had an extremely unfavorable impact on the company s business  Other companies like Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   and Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL   too had to bear the brunt of these issues  Also  the effect of Brexit on the upcoming earnings remains to be seen 
However  positives like low fuel prices  focus on business travelers with new initiatives like United Polaris and some headway in negotiations on employee contracts should boost the company s results and lead to margin expansion  Also  the company finally saw some improvement in June with growth in traffic 
Improved Guidance by the Company
The company recently raised its guidance for the second quarter  United Airlines expects consolidated PRASM in the second quarter to decline 6 50 6 75   compared with previous band of 6 50 7 5    Pre tax margin is expected in the band of 14  to 14 5   Fuel Price  inclusive of all cash settled hedges  is projected at  1 44 per gallon  old guidance   1 45 to  1 50  UNITED CONT HLD Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that United Continental is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below Zacks ESP  The Most Accurate estimate stands at  2 54  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 53  Hence  the ESP is  0 40  Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

195270,416786,UAL,3 Key Takeaways From Carnival s  CCL  FQ2 Earnings Report,opinion,"Carnival  LON CCL  Corporation   NYSE CCL   released their FQ2 earnings report before the market opened on Tuesday  in which they reported earnings that beat expectations 
The Miami based Carnival is the largest company in the cruise industry  currently operating 10 global brands as well as over 100 ships  CCL reported FQ2 earnings of  0 49 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  0 10  The firm also announced revenue of  3 71B  beating estimates by  30M 
Important to note is CCL s guidance for this fiscal year  which ends in November  This is up to an expectation of a net yield of 3 5  year over year  up from March s guidance of 3   CCL management noted that second through fourth fiscal quarters  bookings are  well ahead of last year s totals  and at higher prices   signaling their confidence in continued strength 
CCL has authorized the buyback of another  1B worth of stock  of which the firm has already bought  1 9B since October  signaling their confidence moving forward 
FQ2 earnings continue CCL s trend of beating expectations  with an average EPS surprise of 27 84   It gives us further reason to draw some conclusions about the firm and as well as the Leisure industry as a whole  Before getting overly optimistic  let s take a look at three key takeaways from today s report 
Inputs Play a Key Role 
As per CCL s press release   changes in fuel prices and currency exchange rates contributed  0 04 per share to FQ2 earnings   It has been two years now since the cost of oil plummeted from the over  100 per barrel price at which it traded  The energy industry has felt the pain associated with this  but for a company like Carnival  it has served to help increase profit margins 
Net cruise costs excluding fuel expenses decreased 1 9  compared with estimates for an increase of between 0 5  and 1 5   However  if oil prices continue to rise  companies like CCL will be directly and negatively impacted 
Oil s volatility stems from many moving parts  one of which is supply and demand  Depending on how many barrels are expended weekly  the market reacts  As   factors such as a looming worker strike in Norwegian oil firms and rebel attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria have brought prices up 
The point stands that the macroeconomic atmosphere is very volatile  and major shifts could continue to benefit or severely cripple CCL 
Carnival Relies on Europe and Good Weather
CCL has three major business markets  the Caribbean  Alaska and Europe  As  reports  consumer activity in the Caribbean has decreased from nearly half of all bookings to a third of them  As a direct result  dependence on revenue from Europe has increased 
  Brexit has positive effects for U S  tourists looking to travel to Europe  but not for European tourists  British and European travelers will have to spend more on everything  including CCL cruises  Because CCL is so heavily exposed to Europe and not the U S   Brexit could negatively bring down revenues from here on out 
Like any other cruise business  CCL is heavily exposed to changes in weather  FQ3  which encompasses summer  is generally the largest source of revenue for these companies  In CCL s case  current FQ3 EPS estimates sit at around  1 98 per share  dramatically higher than this fiscal quarter 
Things may appear smooth sailing at this point  but it is important to consider that 67  of earnings estimate revisions for this fiscal year have been downward  Although that estimate is still a positive one at an EPS of  3 39  CCL is entirely subject to macroeconomic headwinds as described above 
Travel Industry Outlook
Although CCL s earning reports is a good sign  the broader picture in the travel industry could be a bit grimmer  As our team s tourism report continues  travel in the EU will become hampered by British exit from the EU  particularly due to the  Open Skies  policy that made it free for any EU airline to fly between two points within Europe 
The travel industry is subject to the same macroeconomic factors that CCL is  input costs  consumer spending  currency strength  etc  This means that factors that would drag CCL down will drag other travel companies down as well  In the short term  this next fiscal quarter should be good for most major firms that are not overly or solely exposed to Europe 
Brexit has great potential for U S  tourists  with the dollar up and the pound trading at a 32 year low along with a weak Euro  It is a reasonable assumption that international tourism in Europe could increase  This could potentially benefit U S  based firms such as United Airlines   NYSE UAL   and Delta Airlines   NYSE DAL   
Bottom Line
Carnival s strong earnings report is a reason for investors to rejoice  as they have been and are continuing to beat expectations  Although inventory is limited for the rest of the year  CCL management has positive  narrowed expectations  All in all  current signs point towards a fairly solid performance this fiscal year for CCL

The firm also slashed its price target on shares of the airliner to  42 from  64 
Credit Suisse analyst Julie Yates argued that free cash flow will begin to disappear in 2017 for the Chicago based company  as aircraft capital expenditures rise   Fading free cash generation slows further delivering progress and stifles the prospect that buybacks continue anywhere near the 2016 level   Yates added 
In terms of management  Yates believes that they are headed down the right path  addressing sources of financial underperformance as well as outlining cost and revenue strategies to help bolster growth by 2018

195274,416790,UAL,8 Airlines  10 U S  Cities Awarded Flights To Havana,opinion,"On Thursday  the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  announced that it has given the green light for eight U S  airlines to fly to Havana from 10 different U S  cities  The decision gives the airlines at least one weekly nonstop flight to Cuba s capital  and overall  the DOT has approved 14 different daily routes to Havana in addition to one Saturday only route 
 Today we take another important step toward delivering on President Obama s promise to reengage Cuba   said Anthony Foxx  DOT secretary  in a  revealing the routes   Restoring regular air service holds tremendous potential to reunite Cuban American families and foster education and opportunities for American businesses of all sizes  
The move is one of many in a chain of events that began with President Obama and President Castro announcing a new course in relations between the U S  and Cuba on December 17th  2014  Travel to Cuba has increased this year due in part to the efforts of the Obama administration  As  points out  travel by Americans to Cuba has increased by 77 percent within the last year   
The DOT had already approved flights to other Cuban cities back in June  through which six airlines can fly from five U S  destinations to nine Cuban cities other than Havana  Tentatively  the eight airline companies that will receive the flights are Alaska   NYSE ALK    American   NASDAQ AAL    Delta   NYSE DAL    Frontier  JetBlue  Southwest   NYSE LUV    Spirit   NASDAQ SAVE   and United   NYSE UAL   
Each of the aforementioned companies  stock is up today on the news  Although relations with Cuba are still metaphorically under construction  the progress appears promising  and could result in more flights down the road 
As it stands  only 20 daily round trip flights are allowed between the U S A  and Havana  However  demand from airliners is apparent  with three times that volume requested from the government 
The DOT believes it will have its final list ready  later this summer  ",2016-07-07,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/8-airlines,-10-u.s.-cities-awarded-flights-to-havana-200140630",200140630
195280,416796,UAL,Why Are Airline Stocks Crashing Today  ,opinion,"A quick glance at the stock market s biggest movers on Tuesday reveals that the airline industry is getting absolutely hammered  Major carriers like American Airlines   NASDAQ AAL    United Holdings   NYSE UAL    and Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   are down more than 4 5   and regional fliers like Alaska Air   NYSE ALK   and Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   are also showing big dips 
A lot of the activity surrounding the airline sector can be attributed to this weekend s shooting in Orlando  Fifty people were killed and 53 more were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in American history at a gay nightclub early Sunday morning  and the shooter allegedly called 911 and pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State prior to the attack 
While the attacker s motives and possible connections to foreign terrorist organizations are still being investigated  acts of terror do tend to have an impact on consumer behavior  Notably  travel based stocks can dip on the assumption that people are less likely to travel because of safety concerns 
On top of the Orlando attack  there was a bombing on Sunday afternoon at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport that left five people injured  That case is being attributed to a frustrated migrant worker with gambling debts  but in the wake of the Orlando shooting  it could be contributing to fears as well 
Furthermore  plenty of airline stocks have received analyst downgrades recently  Alaska Air was bounced down to  outperform  from  strong buy  at Raymond Jones  and its price target was cut to  88 from  105 
Raymond Jones also cut its price target for American Airlines  The firm now has a target of  46 for the airliner  down from its previous  48 mark  AAL is down over 20  on the year  Barclays  LON BARC  and Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  recently issued  equal weight  ratings for Southwest 
Bottom Line
Terrorism attacks tend to send airline stocks into a dip based on the assumption that travelers will opt to stay home instead  It s important to note that this is based on assumptions  and we do not have any data yet that suggests that the Orlando attack has had an effect on travel behavior 
 Time will tell  but the investigation and response to the attack may hold the final answer  If no connections to international terror organizations appear clear  perhaps travelers will feel fine going around the world 
Consumer behavior is tricky  and the market can sometimes overreact  With that said  major events do have an effect on people  Right now  the airline sector is volatile on this news and may take some time to calm down ",2016-06-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-are-airline-stocks-crashing-today-200135929,200135929

Why the Downgrade 
Shares of Delta  like its peers including American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   and United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL    have been suffering greatly due to the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando and the explosion at the Shanghai Pudong airport on Jun 12

Moreover  the explosion at Shanghai s Pudong International Airport highlights the necessity to tighten security at airports 
Outlook
Moreover  Delta issued a below par guidance while reporting its May traffic figures  The carrier now expects passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  a measure of unit revenue  to decline around 4 5  in the second quarter of 2016  The earlier projection had called for a decline in the band of 2 5  to 4 5   Delta expects operating margin near the lower end  i e  near 21   of its previous view in the band of 21  to 23  for the second quarter

In a customer friendly move  the Fort Worth  TX based American Airlines Group modified its AAdvantage Loyalty Program  Following the modification  the elite members of American Airlines  AAdvantage

195304,416820,UAL,Major Airlines Bump Up Dividends  More Hikes On The Way ,opinion,"It was not too long ago that stocks in the airline space were struggling on the financial front  many of them even filing for bankruptcy protection  Airlines were struggling to stay afloat in the early part of the century  grappling with issues like high fuel costs  among others  Moreover  the U S  terror attacks in Sep 2001 dealt a severe blow to airlines  To deal with such adverse factors  airlines resorted to cost cutting measures like headcount reduction 
Gloomy Backdrop
Given this gloomy background  it is no surprise that big players in the space like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   had filed for bankruptcy  The Atlanta  GA based company had slipped into bankruptcy in 2005 and eventually managed to come out of it following its merger with Northwest Airlines  United Airlines had also filed for bankruptcy in 2002  The company in its current form    United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL      was formed in 2010 following the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines 
Meanwhile  American Airlines had filed for bankruptcy in 2011  The subsequent merger of AMR  American Airlines  parent group  and US Airways in 2013  which resulted in the formation of American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    proved advantageous 
Oil Price Dip  A Godsend 
The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in 2014 hurt stocks immensely in the airline space   However  Ebola related fears subsided gradually and this coincided with the free fall in oil prices  With costs associated with fuel being one of the most significant expenses for airlines  soft crude prices have resulted in massive savings for carriers  thereby boosting their financial health  Naturally  this caused a massive rebound in the fortunes of airline stocks helping carriers like American Airlines and Delta Air Lines  which had filed for bankruptcy protection not too long ago  rake in huge profits 
The current financial prosperity in the airline space has prompted carriers to pay out dividends apart from engaging in activities like share buybacks and sharing of profits  Earlier this year  employees of Delta Air Lines received the highest payout in the history of corporate profit sharing programs  Low cost carrier  Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV   made its highest profit sharing payment   620 million  this year  
American Airlines  which was earlier opposed to profit sharing  reversed its stance and embraced the scheme in Mar 2016  The much improved balance sheets of the airlines have also seen a surge in buybacks 
Uptick in Dividend Payouts
The massive savings due to cheap oil has led to major players in the space paying healthy dividends to its shareholders  a development which did not seem feasible in the days of financial crisis for carriers 
In 2015  Delta Air Lines raised its cash quarterly dividend to 13 5 cents per share  54 cents per share annualized   representing an increase of 50  over the previous payout of 9 cents per share  Last year  Southwest Airlines too raised its quarterly dividend  The payout was increased 25  to 7 5 cents per share  30 cents per share annualized   The trend of hiking dividends continued with the Seattle  Washington  based Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK   announcing in Jan this year a 38  hike in its quarterly dividend to 27 5 cents  SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   too announced a 25  increase in its quarterly dividend payout earlier this year 
Will More Hikes Follow 
With oil unlikely to touch the highs witnessed in mid 2014 any time soon  airlines are expected to maintain the healthy run going ahead  Despite the recent rally  crude prices have been hovering around the  45 a barrel mark  This represents a significant decline from the approximately  105 per barrel in Jul 2014 
The encouraging 2016 profitability forecast issued by the International Air Transport Association  IATA  further justifies our bullish stance on airline stocks  The trade association expects the airline industry to register profits of  36 3 billion in 2016 with a net profit margin of 5 1   That airline companies have witnessed a turn of fortunes as oil began to sink mid 2014 onward can be made out from the fact that IATA s 2016 profit projection is more than double the  17 3 billion achieved in profits in 2014 
Given this encouraging backdrop  we expect dividend hikes to continue in 2016  For example  Delta Air Lines  which made a whopping  5 9 billion in pre tax profit in 2015  is a prime candidate to raise its dividend payout this year  The likes of Southwest Airlines may also follow suit  Whatever be the final outcome we expect investors in the airline space to stay focused on this burning issue ",2016-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/major-airlines-bump-up-dividends:-more-hikes-on-the-way-200130229,200130229

195308,416824,UAL,Lufthansa  LATAM Airlines To Exit Venezuela  More To Follow ,opinion,"The Venezuelan economy has been in the doldrums for quite some time with the onslaught not sparing airlines with operations there  The Venezuelan government apparently owes over  3 5 billion in revenues  from ticket sales  to airlines  Naturally  this has compelled many carriers to trim capacity suspend operations in the country  dealing a heavy blow to the nation s tourism sector 
Oil Woes 
As oil is the country s primary source of income for the nation  the fall in the commodity price since mid 2014 has crippled the economy 
Despite the recent rally  oil is currently hovering around the  50 a barrel mark  The commodity had traded over  100 a barrel in mid 2014  No wonder this massive fall has hit the cash reserves of this oil rich country  with inflation rate in triple digits  With the economy on the verge of collapse  residents are feeling the heat and are apparently struggling to have access to even basic amenities like treatment 
Repatriation Issues
Airline companies are required to sell tickets in Venezuelan currency  the bolivar  Meanwhile  the tightening of currency policies in the nation has made it increasingly difficult for international carriers to convert their earnings into dollars 
With a considerable amount of their earnings trapped in the South American nation  carriers like Delta Air Lines Inc    NYSE DAL   and American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL   had trimmed their services to Venezuela  American Airlines had reinstated flights connecting Caracas and New York in Dec 2015  only to scrap it three months later  citing low demand as the reason 
Currency issues caused carriers like GOL Linhas   NYSE GOL   suspend their Venezuelan operations altogether  The list of international carriers exiting the troubled country have been on the rise with the likes of Santiago  Chile based LATAM Airlines Group S A   NYSE LFL   and German carrier Lufthansa   OTC DLAKY   announcing their decisions to suspend operations in the nation 
According to a Bloomberg report  Lufthansa will also not be operating flights between Frankfurt and Caracas  until further notice  starting next month  The carrier apparently has revenues over  100 million trapped in Venezuela  LATAM Airlines also announced plans to withdraw its operations in Venezuela  effective July end  However  the carrier might resume operations if the situation in the country improves 
Meanwhile  it is to be noted that repatriation issues are not unique to Venezuela  Few days ago  United Continental Holdings   NYSE UAL   had  its decision to stop flying to Nigeria on similar grounds 
More Pullouts Likely
With the situation showing no signs of improvement  the International Monetary Fund has predicted that recession in the Venezuelan economy will continue in 2016  The economy is predicted to contract 8  over 2015 levels  This marks a drastic deterioration from the 5 7  contraction witnessed in 2015 
Political uncertainties are increasing with each passing day and the inflation rate is likely to hover around 500  in 2016  In view of this gloomy projection  it is likely that more international carriers will join Lufthansa and LATAM Airlines in suspending flights to Venezuela ",2016-05-31,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/lufthansa,-latam-airlines-to-exit-venezuela,-more-to-follow-200133169",200133169
195315,416831,UAL,Why Did Hawaiian Holdings Close 11  Down on the Day,opinion,"Airliner Hawaiian Holdings  NASDAQ HA  released its fiscal 2016 first quarter results yesterday and many investors were not too happy with the results  Shares of the airline company closed on the day 11 36  down due to weaker than expected revenue figures 
Despite outperforming our EPS estimate by 6 67   Hawaiian Holdings reported  551 18 million  which is noticeably  but not drastically  lower than our revenue estimate of  556 million 
Hawaiian Holdings president and chief executive officer Mark Dunkerley was not deterred from not meeting revenue estimates   The outstanding first quarter results are a strong start to 2016   said Mr  Dunkerley   Solid demand for travel to Hawai i  manageable industry capacity growth  and the low cost of fuel combined with the exceptional service that our employees deliver to our guests propelled our record results this quarter  Looking ahead  our outlook is for these positive trends to continue reinforcing our confidence that 2016 will be a great year  
Some of Hawaiian Holdings  competitors fared better with regards to its earnings results and its recent stock prices 
Alaska Air Group  NYSE ALK  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  both  to more promising results than Hawaiian Holdings  Alaska Air s adjusted earnings came in at  1 45 per share  outperforming our estimate of  1 42  and Southwest s earnings came in at  0 88 per share while our estimates were  0 84 per share 
Alaska Air s  revenues of  1 35 billion narrowly beat out our consensus estimate of  1 34 billion  with the top line growing 6  on a year over year basis  and Southwest s revenue figure of  4 82 billion narrowly eclipsed our  4 81 billion estimate as well and increased 9 3  on a year over year basis

195321,416837,UAL,This Volatile Industry Is Ready For Takeoff,opinion,"Last month  one of the most storied airline brands faded away 
An overnight flight from San Francisco to Philadelphia marked the last ever departure under the U S  Airways name  Soon  the carrier s merger with American Airlines will be complete  leaving us with just four major airlines in the U S 
So what does it mean for the airline industry  Are they in trouble  or is this a turning point  This week s chart holds the answer   
It looks at how the major airlines in the U S   as a whole  have performed against the S P 500 over the last three months  As you can see  2015 is turning out to be a positive year for the industry 
There are four reasons for this   


Airlines are finally enjoying the benefits of years of cost cutting 

The industry is benefiting from improved aircraft efficiency and falling oil prices 

Passenger numbers are on the rise as improving unemployment rates have given many families more spending power 

Airlines are pocketing more revenue than ever from  

That last point may irk you as a passenger  but it s great news for airline investors  By the end of 2015  the world s airlines are expected to collect  59 2 billion in passenger fees  an 18  increase over last year 
Global airlines project net profits of  29 3 billion in 2015   nearly double that of 2014 
Of course  many still face an uphill battle and slim profit margins  But one region that is performing very well is North America  Over half of the global profits are expected to be generated by airlines based here   15 7 billion  
Clearly the industry is gaining strength  However  it may still be a little too early to hang your hat on just one company  Instead  consider riding the trend with the US Global Jets  N JETS   It holds 33 total securities with double digit allocations going to the four major airlines in the U S 
That s Southwest Airlines Company  N LUV      American Airlines Group  O AAL     Delta Air Lines Inc  N DAL     and United Continental Holdings Inc  N UAL 
As a result  this specialty ETF shot up 10 5  in October 
While it is unclear what could happen next with the industry  this ETF covers you across the board  Its concentration on airlines based in North America makes Global Jets a relatively safe way to invest in this volatile industry ",2015-11-22,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-volatile-industry-is-ready-for-takeoff-272089,272089

195334,416850,UAL,How To Trade The Ebola Crisis,opinion,"Editor s Note  We re sharing this Total Wealth with you because we believe that the ongoing Ebola outbreak will continue to be disruptive to markets all over the world  But as we ve seen many  many times before  out of chaos comes opportunity  Here s Keith 
I believe Ebola may be the most serious threat to humanity since the bubonic plague of the Middle Ages  Already it has spread to a dozen countries  including the U S   and more than 4 000 people are dead  According to Dr  Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization  WHO   mortality rates are rising and now sit at 70  
This outbreak is more grim proof that the global trend of war  terrorism and ugliness is indeed a growth industry 
That s the next trend we ll be discussing  though it s easily my least favorite both personally and professionally  But it s very  very important  So please stay tuned for that in the weeks ahead 
In the meantime  Ebola clearly qualifies as  ugliness   It has the potential to be a serious market event before it s brought under control  Recent trading suggests  in fact  that it already is by virtue of the fact that some  1 5 trillion has already been wiped from the exchanges on Ebola related fear driven trading 
Key Takeaways to Protect Your Wealth
Here are three key tactics that will help you stay in the game and in pursuit of the longer term profits we know are out there 
Make sure your trailing stops are in place  I recommend using these across the board to ensure that your money is protected against catastrophic loss 
Cover your downside with investment choices that will profit in a fall  Shorting United Continental  NYSE UAL  is one way to hedge the short term potential associated with a single company in a single industry  But to hedge your whole portfolio  I like a specialized inverse fund called the Rydex Inverse S P 500 Strategy   Investor Class  RYURX   which rises as the S P 500 falls  Studies show that having between 3  and 5  of investable assets in inverse funds not only takes the sting out any short term market drop  but helps reduce overall portfolio volatility so you can remain focused on opportunity rather than fear 
Be ready to buy  Every short term market event ultimately passes  Ebola will  too  When the corner turns  you ll want to cover your bases and load up  It will be tough if the disease really creates panic  but absolutely the right thing to do for your financial success 
So we need to talk about it logically   no hype  no conspiracies  and no nonsense  I mention those things because they re all emotional inputs that can cloud your thinking and have a seriously negative impact on your money 
Here are the tactics you need on hand for the Ebola market event 
Ebola and the Airline Industry
Air traffic is the main component to Ebola s spread  as the report from the Laboratory for Modeling of Biological and Socio Technical Systems at Northeastern University makes clear  According to Prof  Alex Vespignani  as reported by Reuters  the risks  change every day the epidemic continues  
Other experts like Dr  C J  Peters and virologists of the CDC and the U S  Army s Medical Research and Development Command are cautioning that Ebola could mutate and become transmissible through the air 
While there have been some politicians calling for bans on flights coming out of West Africa  these seem unlikely to be enacted  The White House  the WHO  and other groups have made it clear that they view the idea of cutting off the three countries in which Ebola runs rampant as not just politically unfeasible  but also impractical as a tool to fight the spread of Ebola 
Yet  there s nothing officials can do about people s personal inclinations ",2014-10-17,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-trade-the-ebola-crisis-229464,229464
195335,416851,UAL,Airline Stocks Flying High In 2015,opinion,"One of the major input costs for airlines is fuel  and with oil prices hitting multi year lows  airlines will subsequently start to see improved operating margins  Further  the length at which oil prices have been subdued is significantly aiding airline company s top and bottom lines for at least Q4 2014  and Q1 2015  As we wash away 2014 and enter into 2015  investors need to look at areas where commodities  and other input costs are inexpensive  and for the first time in many years  the airline industry is getting a reprieve from high input costs  Further  with the increased oil output volume from the U S   it appears as though oil prices will be subdued for the near term  Specifically  the most recent US oil inventory data posted just before the new year showed an increased supply in U S crude stockpiles  rose 760 000 barrels   and saw stockpiles at the Cushing Oklahoma delivery point increase by 1 8 million barrels according to the American Petroleum Institute   Typically  the winter season sees the largest decline in U S  oil inventory due to the cold weather  and the most recent report stating that there is an oversupply has caused oil prices to drop once again  According to the Energy Information Administration s  EIA  December Short Term Energy Outlook  they  forecasts that Brent crude oil prices will average  68 per barrel  bbl  in 2015  with prices up to  5 bbl below the annual average early in the year   Further  the forecast for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  would average  63 bbl in 2015  according to the EIA  If these average prices hold true  that would mean increasing margins  and declining costs for the airline industry throughout 2015  Moreover  prices are expected to be lower in the first part of the year compared with the second part of the year  Making the fourth quarter 2014  and the first quarter 2015 the time frame for this industry segment to see solid growth levels   With all the positive news for the airline industry  Zacks has identified four companies that are best positioned to reap the gains in 2015 Who to Look ForHawaiian Holdings  NASDAQ HA   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  recently reported their fourth consecutive positive earnings surprise in Q3 2014  and saw revenues increase by 7  year over year   Over the past 90 days estimates for Q4 14  FY 14  Q1 15  and FY 15 have all increased  Q4 14 increased from  0 25 to  0 37  FY 14 rose from  1 37 to  1 51  Q1 15 was hiked from  0 07 to  0 10  and FY 15 jumped up from  1 56 to  2 10  Much of the estimate increase is due to declining oil prices  As you can see in the table below  Hawaiian Holdings has seen a massive uptick after their last strong earnings report  This is not accounting for the massive oil price drop in Q4 2014  Expectations are very high for Hawaiian s Q4 earnings report 

Southwest Air  NYSE LUV  a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  has met or beat their earnings and revenue expectations over the last 5 consecutive quarters  posting an average positive earnings surprise of 12 22  and beating revenue expectations by more than  40 million each quarter on average   Due to weak oil prices  estimates for LUV have increased over the past 60 days for Q4 14  FY 14  Q1 15 and FY 15  Q4 14 rose from  0 51 to  0 54  FY 14 increased from  1 92 to  1 97  Q1 15 jumped from  0 33 to  0 46  and FY 15 rose from  2 34 to  2 81   As you can see in the table below  Southwest Air s last 5 positive earnings surprises have caused significant positive price appreciation  According to Zack s models  this trend is expected to continue in the first half of 2015 

United Continental Holdings  NYSE UAL   a Zacks Rank  1 has posted a positive earnings surprise over the last four consecutive quarters with an average positive surprise of 6 4   Further  United Continental has the most leverage to lower fuel prices amongst the airlines  and therefore should see the largest price appreciation relative to fuel prices over the near term   Like our other picks  United Continental Holdings has seen their Zacks Earnings Estimates increase over the past 60 days for Q4 14  FY 14  Q1 15  FY 15  Estimates for Q4 14 rose from  1 09 to  1 18  FY 14 increased from  4 96 to  5 06  Q1 15 jumped up from  0 02 to  0 56  and FY 15 rose from  6 43 to  8 72 
As you can see in the table below  UAL has seen positive price appreciation after their last four earnings reports  With oil continuing to decline  and airfare prices staying the same  profits are only increasing for this airline company 

Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  a Zacks Rank   1 has posted five consecutive quarters with positive revenue and earnings beats with an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 4 91   Delta Airlines is the best of class for airlines going into 2015  and with ever declining oil prices the next two quarters look great for the company   Delta Airlines has seen their Zacks Consensus Estimate increase over the past 60 days for Q4 14  FY 14  Q1 15  FY 15  Estimates for Q4 14 have increased from  0 67 to  0 73  FY 14 rose from  3 24 to  3 30  Q1 15 jumped from  0 61 to  0 74  and FY 15 increased from  4 06 to  4 57  As you can see in the table below  Delta has seen significant price appreciation over the past several positive earnings  and is expected to rise even higher due to declining oil prices 

Bottom Line With oil prices declining  and no change in airline ticket prices  the airline industry is poised to reap a world wind of profits in Q4 0214  and Q1 2015 at a minimum  The four mentioned airline stocks are the best positioned in the airline segment to see significant earnings and revenue growth over the next 1 3 months

195336,416852,UAL,Why This Airline Just Landed On The S P 500 Index,opinion,"For the first time in its 84 year history  American Airlines was cleared for landing in the S P 500 Index  Joining rivals Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   the once beleaguered carrier is the newest member of the prestigious club for the nation s largest companies by market capitalization  Not bad for a company that  only four years ago  found itself in bankruptcy court  But in a classic Cinderella story transformation  American succeeded at charting a new course for itself  In 2013 it merged with U S  Airways  making it the biggest airline group in the world  The company now has a market cap of nearly  37 billion and controls 627 active jets in its fleet  American s ascension is a perfect reflection of the now robust airline industry as a whole  As recently as a decade ago  about  were operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  Fast forward to 2014  and the industry saw its most profitable year ever  To generate more revenue and save money  airlines have aggressively implemented new policies in the last few years  including adding additional seats on aircraft  streamlining operations and focusing on fuel efficiency measures  American Airlines stock is already up more than 51 percent for the 12 month period  compared to the S P 500 s 14 percent  and is currently trading close to all time highs  Its inclusion in the S P 500 should further help its stock price climb higher  as many funds that track the index will now be compelled to purchase shares  
Low oil prices have benefited American more so than some of its competitors  as the carrier didn t buy derivatives on fuel and was therefore not locked into higher prices before they began to tumble last summer  Many analysts predict that the next airline to join the S P could be United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  
Dollar Overbought  Gold Oversold
In a  I revisited the relationship between the U S  dollar and gold  For the ninth straight month  the greenback has strengthened  which has weighed heavily on the yellow metal  The inverse relationship between the two is key to understanding the Fear Trade  As I discussed in the blog post  the dollar is extended the greatest standard deviation in a decade and it appears due for a correction  Conversely  the gold sell off is overdone and looking for a rally  This week we ll be looking out for the latest consumer price index  CPI   or inflationary number  It s important to be aware of this number because the inflation rate has a large influence on gold prices  The weekend before last I presented at the Investment U conference in St  Petersburg  Florida  where I had the pleasure of hearing Oxford Club s natural resources strategist  Sean Brodrick  speak  He reminded his audience why so many investors see gold as a safe haven  saying that  unlike the dollar   gold will never go to zero   As always  I advocate that 10 percent of your portfolio consist of gold  5 percent in bullion and 5 percent in gold stocks  then rebalance every year  
Munis Still Make Sense 
Safety is part of the reason why the municipal bond market is today worth  3 65 trillion  To determine just how safe munis have been for investors  Moody s looked at more than 54 000 municipal bond issuers and 5 600 high yield corporate bond issuers between 1970 and 2011  What they found is that only 71 muni issuers defaulted  whereas corporate bond defaults for the period rose to more than 1 800  What s more  even lower rated munis have historically had better credit quality than high rated corporate bonds  In  Moody s reported that since 1970   adequate  Baa rated munis have had a default rate of 0 30 percent  But of the corporate bonds that received the highest   extremely strong  rating  0 50 percent failed to meet their obligations  Munis had a stellar 2014  delivering positive returns all 12 months of the year  This helped the asset class outperform both corporate bonds and high yield corporate bonds  Rightfully so  many bond investors are concerned about what might happen to their holdings when the Federal Reserve decides to raise rates  which could happen sometime this year  When interest rates rise  bond prices drop  For this reason  the bond market reacted positively to Fed Chair Janet Yellen s announcement last Wednesday that a rate hike wouldn t occur just yet  Short term munis are where investors want to be when rates inevitably increase  Short term bonds are less sensitive to rate increases than longer term bonds that are locked into rates for greater periods of time  Disclosure and Disclaimer  Past performance is no guarantee of future results  Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings  For a portion of periods  the fund had expense limitations  without which returns would have been lower  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted  The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares  when redeemed  may be worth more or less than their original cost  Performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund s prospectus which  if applicable  would lower your total returns  Performance quoted for periods of one year or less is cumulative and not annualized

195337,416853,UAL,Signs Point To Airline Industry Secular Bull Market,opinion,"The week before last I was in Melbourne  Australia  attending a conference for chief executives from all over the world  While there  I spoke with many of my peers about the airline industry  which is currently in a  three year bull run as measured by the S P 500 Airlines Index  I was surprised to learn that several people incorrectly assumed that the airline industry is included in the consumer discretionary sector of the S P 500 Index  It does seem as if it belongs there  along with travel  hospitality and leisure  But the industry actually qualifies as an industrial  Regardless of which sector airlines belong in  the fleet has flown past both industrials and consumer discretionaries for the five year period  Not only that  but airlines were the best performing industry in industrials for the one year  three year and five year periods  A misconception held among some investors is that airline stocks are outperforming right now only because fuel costs are down  Fuel  after all  accounted for about 30 percent of carriers  operating costs in 2014  The implication  some believe  is that when oil prices begin to recover  airlines will be first to feel the pinch  This isn t necessarily the case  The industry is in a much more rational business environment than it was a decade ago  Over the last five years  fundamental changes have taken place  including consolidation  new sources of revenue  better fuel efficiency and additional seats  that have helped airlines excel even when oil is  100 per barrel or more  In fact  airline stocks for the four industry leaders United Airlines  NYSE UAL   Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   American Airlines Group  NASDAQ AAL  and Southwest Airlines  NYSE LUV  began their recent ascent even before oil prices began to plummet 50 to 60 percent starting last summer  And because most airlines hedge their fuel  they re still locked into  100 per barrel oil prices and therefore haven t yet felt the full benefits of lower fuel costs  American is one of the few that doesn t hedge  Airline research analyst Helane Becker of financial services firm Cowen Group writes  American participates in 100 percent of the decline in jet fuel prices  The current per gallon price is  1 78  and American uses 4 4 billion gallons of jet fuel annually  so every  1 change in oil  saves the company  approximately  105 million per month  Contributing to American s diminishing operating costs is its purchase of dozens of new aircraft 99 delivered last year  112 expected this year that will replace older  less fuel efficient jets  This should help the company save millions not only in jet fuel but also maintenance fees for many years to come  It should also be noted that new baggage tracking technology has led to a dramatic decrease in lost and mishandled luggage  helping airlines all over the globe save billions and keep passengers happy  Even as the number of worldwide passengers has steadily increased year over year exceeding a record three billion in 2013 there s been a drop of 61 percent in missing bags since the peak in 2007  As a result  carriers save a collective  18 billion a year  
Free Cash Flow
Often it s not enough to look just at a company s revenue for any given time frame to determine its strength  A more precise metric is free cash flow  which tells you how much cash the company has in the bank after taxes and all operating expenses have been paid  In other words  it s what the company is  free  to spend  The higher a company s free cash flow yield  the better  When the yield is higher  the company is more likely to plow that extra cash back into its growth or declare a dividend  American  for instance  began paying a dividend last summer  Alaska Airlines  NYSE ALK   the summer before last  Last year  Delta announced a stock buyback plan worth  2 billion and a dividend increase of 50 percent  At this May s Bank of America Merrill Lynch Industrials Conference  the company is expected to make a similar announcement another buyback authorization and a possible dividend boost of 25 percent  As you can see below  U S  airlines  free cash flow is expected to reach a record high this year and each subsequent year  Domestic carriers have never had this much cash potential on their hands cash that can be used to grow and improve their businesses as well as reward shareholders  If we look at individual companies  free cash flow  three of them Delta  Southwest and United Airlines are expected to have yields above an impressive 10 percent in 2015  An airline industry report by J P  Morgan stated last week 

We believe in the persistence of cash flows and the presence of a good structural model  The sector has begun to show us their success instead of repeating  trust me    T he cash is real  the margins are real  the buybacks are real 

In light of this success  some analysts are concerned that airlines  flush with cash for the first time in recent memory  will increase capacity too quickly and outpace demand  Two main arguments can be made here  For one  the industry is highly correlated to a nation s GDP  and carriers have historically avoided growing faster than the economy by too wide of a margin  The second argument has to do with what experts believe is an imminent pilot shortage in the U S 
Pilot Shortage Ahead  
The Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  mandates that all pilots must retire at age 65  which should open up many commercial airliner positions over the coming years  But because the starting salary with a regional carrier is around  20 000 per year  fewer and fewer would be aviators can justify the typical  50 000 a year flight training  not to mention the required 1 500 hours of flight time before they can even be considered for a position  You might be wondering why carriers aren t able to make up the difference by recruiting more pilots out of the military  The reason is because a greater number of people are being trained now to fly drones than jets and piloting a drone doesn t count toward commercial flight hours  This all might sound like troubling news  but it actually has the effect of encouraging discipline  reining in excessive spending and curbing carriers from growing too exuberantly  They can always increase seat capacity to a certain extent  of course but generally they re not going to spend money needlessly on new aircraft if there are fewer people available to pilot them You can read more about the airline industry here  here and here

195343,416859,UAL,Transports Point To Overall Weakness,opinion,"Over the last few days  the market s strongest sector has started to lag 
A Monster Drop
The iShares DJ Transport Average Index  ARCA IYT  has taken the markets higher and hasn t looked back  Until now  that is  As a leader  the weakness starting to show up recently should be noted  It very likely speaks to weakness on the horizon for the whole market  Look at airline stocks like United Continental  NYSE UAL   which was down more than 4 5  mid day Wednesday  That s a monster drop that has spread to a majority of other airline stocks  The weakness in the transports is very much like the weakness seen in the  NASDAQ Biotech Index  just months ago  prior to its 25  correction  That drop in biotechs took the NASDAQ down almost 10

195344,416860,UAL,Airlines Collapse But Will Bounce Here,opinion,"Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  and United Continental  NYSE UAL  have collapsed over the last two days  Both stocks are down over 10  from their recent highs  Delta Air Lines and United Continental have more downside to go before they see a quick  sharp bounce  If played correctly  this bounce can pay big money 
Levels To Watch
The Delta Air Lines buy level would be the daily 50 moving average at  37 41 if hit Friday  If not  the time factored buy level is  34 95  Time is important here as the level of  37 41 is only valid on a three bar surge  which would be Friday 
UAL has support at  39 45  There is no time factor as long as this level is reached within the next week  Look for a multi day bounce

195347,416863,UAL,Delta s August Traffic Lacks Bite  Geopolitical Factors At Play ,opinion,"A rise in August traffic figures could not save Delta Air Lines Inc  NYSE DAL  from tumbling as the third largest U S  carrier in terms of passenger count reduced its September quarter forecast partially  The news impacted Delta s stock  which closed the day 5 16  lower 
Delta stated overcapacity in transatlantic routes  the impact of the Ebola outbreak and geo political crisis in Russia and the Middle East as factors weighing on its unit revenues  The Atlanta based carrier now expects its September quarter unit revenue growth to be around 2 3   down from the earlier forecast of 2 4  
Consequently  the reduced unit revenue expectation is likely to have an impact on Delta s margins  The carrier now expects an operating margin of 15 16   down from its previous guidance of 15 17  
Further  despite a fall in Brent crude  jet fuel prices have not seen any meaningful decline  This led the premier carrier to raise its expected fuel price projection for the forthcoming quarter by 2 cents to  2 90  2 95  Notably  jet fuel comprises 30 35  of the airline s operating costs 
Similar concerns have also dragged down some of Delta s traditional peers  American Airlines Group  MX AAL   United Continental Holdings Inc  NYSE UAL  and Southwest Airlines Company  NYSE LUV  were some of the biggest losers 
However  these negatives were partially mitigated by moderate August traffic numbers  Revenue passenger miles or RPMs   which imply revenue generated per mile per passenger   moved up 3 1  year over year to 20 03 billion  Consolidated capacity  available seat miles or ASMs  for the month increased 2 7  from Aug 2013 to 22 87 billion  Passenger revenue per available seat mile  PRASM  improved 2 0  year over year  Continued domestic strength attributed to the improved performance 
The load factor or percentage of seats filled by passengers improved 30 basis points  bps  from Aug 2013 to 87 6  while the completion factor was 99 6   with nearly 84 3  of flights on schedule 
In the first eight months of 2014  Delta has generated RPMs of 137 94 billion  up 3 9  from the corresponding period last year  and ASMs of 161 40 billion  up 2 5  year over year   The load factor improved 120 bps year over year to 85 5  
Delta is expected to generate higher revenues than last year on strong domestic market  capacity discipline  route expansion  cost control measures and customer focused initiatives  Apart from domestic strength  Delta is leveraging from its joint venture with Virgin Atlantic and strong demand within the New York London route  The carrier also held that it will earn a pre tax income of  4 billion in 2014
