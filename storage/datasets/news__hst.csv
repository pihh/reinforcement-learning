quarter  Further  retail rent growth was just 0 1   while mall rents remained flat Regency  too  is not immune to move outs  store closures and retailer bankruptcies  The choppy retail real estate environment is likely to have curbed its growth momentum in the to be reported quarter to some extent as secular industry headwinds continue to dampen industry fundamentals  Moreover  significant

205863,427379,HST,Should Value Investors Consider Host Hotels   Resorts  HST  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc    NYSE HST   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Host Hotels   Resorts has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 99  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 60  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Host Hotels   Resorts  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 86  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers    We should also point out that Host Hotels   Resorts has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 19  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Host Hotels   Resorts has a P S ratio of about 2 36  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 39 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  HST is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Host Hotels   Resorts currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Host Hotels   Resorts a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Host Hotels   Resorts is just 2 04  a level that is lower than the industry average of 3 71  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  HST is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Host Hotels   Resorts might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of F  This gives HST a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the current year estimate has seen four downward revision compared to four upward in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 4 9  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has decreased by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc  Price and Consensus
 
   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Host Hotels   Resorts is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 38  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-12-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-host-hotels--resorts-hst-200491271,200491271

countries and 13 metro areas  including Frankfurt  Amsterdam  Paris and Interxion s Internet Gateway in Marseille  With Digital Realty s solid presence in London and Dublin  Interxion s European business is complementary to the European footprint of the former Quarter in DetailDigital Realty reported operating revenues of  806 5 million in the third quarter  marking a 4 9  year over year rise  The revenue figure  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  815 1 million Signed total bookings during the reported quarter are estimated to generate  69 million of annualized GAAP rental revenues  This would include an  8 million contribution from interconnection  Notably  the weighted average lag between leases signed during third quarter 2019 and the contractual commencement date

60  6 70  reflecting the expected closing of the joint venture with Mapletree in early November  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at  6 67 The full year outlook provided by the company is backed by revenue projections of  3 2 billion  year end portfolio occupancy decline of 150 bps  and  same capital  cash NOI growth of  2 0  to  4 0  Our TakeWhile Digital Realty put up an impressive performance in terms of FFO per share  its lower than expected top line growth was disappointing  Nevertheless  the company continues to invest in a bid to enhance its global platform  The latest deal to combine with Interxion seems a strategic fit given the company s portfolio expansion opportunities and benefit from increased size and scale    Solid fundamentals of the data center market will likely help Digital Realty ride on its growth curve  The company remains well poised to bank on it through accretive acquisitions and development efforts  Nonetheless  aggressive

This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of  1 85   A quarter ago  it was expected that this lodging real estate investment trust would post FFO of  0 45 per share when it actually produced FFO of  0 48  delivering a surprise of 6 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times 
Host Hotels  which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust   Other industry  posted revenues of  1 48 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 48   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 52 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Host Hotels shares have lost about 0 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 5  
What s Next for Host Hotels 
While Host Hotels has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s FFO outlook  Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Host Hotels was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus FFO estimate is  0 38 on  1 32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 81 on  5 60 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

dollar basis  growth of  1  to 0   This reflects an estimated 50 basis points of disruption impact due to the incremental capital expenditures associated with the Marriott transformational capital

205898,427414,HST,Can Value Investors Pick Host Hotels   Resorts  HST  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc    NYSE HST   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Host Hotels   Resorts has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 25  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 91  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Host Hotels   Resorts  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 11 06 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 18  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  Host Hotels   Resorts has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 22  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Host Hotels   Resorts stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Host Hotels   Resorts has a P S ratio of 2 48  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Host Hotels   Resorts currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Host Hotels   Resorts a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Host Hotels   Resorts might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of   This gives HST a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen seven upward revisions versus one downward revision over the past sixty days  while the current year estimates have seen ten upward revisions and no downward revision in the past sixty days This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate which remained stable over the past two months  while the current year estimate has surged 2 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Host Hotels   Resorts  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the reason why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHost Hotels   Resorts is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among Top 33  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 instils investors  optimism in the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good Zacks rank and bullish analyst sentiments signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in HST This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
CCA and Host Hotels are both sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
CXW currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 35  while HST has a forward P E of 12 56  We also note that CXW has a PEG ratio of 1 56  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  HST currently has a PEG ratio of 2 51

205978,427494,HST,3 Stocks With More Than 300  Dividend Growth Over The Last 5 Years,opinion,"Folks love to receive income in the form of dividends   In fact  many investors allocate a large portion of their funds towards investments that pay cash because the consistent income goes a long way in helping them to achieve their financial goals  
A stock with a higher cash payout relative to its share price will have a higher yield  and a higher yield means more cash given back to you for each dollar you invest with   Stocks with a dividend yield of 3  or greater are often called dividend stocks   Their high yields make them very attractive for shareholders who are looking to capture higher levels of income over the long run  
Of course  not all stocks boasting a high yield are worth putting money into   It is important to see that a corporation s business can sustain the cash payouts it provides for investors over time 
Companies that can afford to keep paying their shareholders are great  but dividend stocks that have the potential to pay their shareholders more over time are even better   We have found three such stocks which have proven themselves with regards to growing dividend payouts significantly over the last five years   They also appear well positioned to see continued dividend growth over the long run 
Cisco Systems Inc   NASDAQ CSCO

CSCO currently has a dividend yield of 3 55   and growth metrics suggest that this company has room to boost its cash payouts to shareholders   Cisco s earnings are forecasted to grow by 7 04  this year   It also boasts strong profits  and it has a trailing twelve month net margin of 20 72    Many other peers within its industry are not as profitable  so Cisco stands out as a superior member within the computer networking industry    
Cisco consistently posts a high level of sales every year  and its gross profit margins are very high at about 60    The corporation has also posted a high level of free cash flows over the years  and this suggests that this company can continue to increase its dividend payouts over time     
Host Hotels   Resorts Inc   NYSE HST  
Host Hotels   Resorts is a lodging real estate company that owns and holds controlling interests in luxury hotel properties which operate under premium brands   Some of these high end properties include hotels such as Marriott  Westin  Ritz Carlton  and Hyatt   HST is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it has a market cap of about  12 5 billion

What s really promising about Host Hotels   Resorts is its ability to grow operating cash flows over each of the last five years   In fact  operating cash flows have grown by 75  since 2011   This has helped in improving the corporation s free cash flows  which have been churned out at a high level over each of the last three years   The strong level of cash flows helps to affirm my belief that the company can afford to keep raising its dividend payout per share

Bottom Line
When you buy a stock before it raises its dividend payout  your dividend yield grows   In other words  picking up a stock that yields 3  today could provide 6  to you over the long run if it eventually doubles its payout per share   There are several companies like this out there  but they aren t always easy to find   The key is to watch for companies that have cash flows growth which can sustain a higher yield   These kinds of investment prospects are also bound to see significant share price gains over time since investors love picking up stocks which provide high and sustainable levels of income
