108496,330011,MSI,China s Huawei makes second attempt at Brazil smartphone market,news,"By Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO  Reuters    China s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is making a second attempt at cracking the Brazilian smartphone market  the fourth largest in the world  with the launch of two high end handsets this month  after its cheaper offerings failed to catch on earlier in the decade 
The move will take Huawei beyond its current role in Brazil as a supplier of cellular network equipment to challenge Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co and Lenovo Group s Motorola  NYSE MSI  brand which dominate the local smartphone market 
 Brazil is a market with very significant opportunities for Huawei and we have a competitive portfolio to satisfy consumers  expectations   said Ketrina Dunagan  Huawei s vice president of marketing for the Americas  in a statement emailed to Reuters 
Huawei s plans for Brazil underscore the rise of Chinese companies expanding in Latin America s technology and consumer sectors  moving beyond a traditional focus on commodities and infrastructure 
Brazil is a rare Latin American market where Huawei s phones are still absent from store shelves  The company currently sells handsets in more than a dozen countries in the region  often with a double digit market share 
Huawei  the world s third largest smartphone manufacturer  first launched a smartphone in Brazil in 2014  but the Ascend P7 handset met with weak demand and the project was discontinued 
Now  Huawei is planning to import two premium devices from the new P30 Series equipped with high resolution cameras  the company said  withholding details ahead of the April 30 launch 
 The commercial strategy is completely different this time because the brand is still not well known by Brazilians   said a person familiar with the matter  requesting anonymity to speak openly about plans that have not been made public 
Whereas five years ago  Huawei set up as a supplier to mobile carriers  which sell just a tenth of new smartphones in Brazil  this time the company is looking to partner with retail chains that sell more than two thirds of handsets  the source said 
More cutting edge models should also help Huawei lure the attention of increasingly sophisticated buyers 
 The Brazilian market has reached a maturity level and manufacturers must bring novelties to convince consumers to replace their smartphones for new ones   said Renato Meireles  a research analyst at IDC Brasil 
Smartphone sales in Brazil are expected to fall 4 3 percent this year  Meireles added  after a 6 8 percent drop in 2018 
 The first semester is still affected by economic and political turbulences  but sales should improve in the second semester with the arrival of new players   he said ",2019-04-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/chinas-huawei-makes-second-attempt-at-brazil-smartphone-market-1839988,1839988

Uros  a privately owned company based in Oulu  sells mobile connections for industrial devices and sensors and sees more rapid growth ahead from a Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  partnership  Chief Executive Jerry Raatikainen told Talouselama in an interview 
 IoT  Internet of Things  is a bigger phenomenon than Nokia s phones at the start of 2000  This could become anything   Raatikainen said  adding his company intended to maintain its growth rate into 2022 
Finland s Nokia was the world s No  1 mobile phone maker until 2012  After failing to respond to rapid growth in demand for smart phones  the company remade itself into a network equipment maker 
Despite rapid growth  Uros  businesses have proved highly profitable  In 2018  Uros made a profit of 120 million euros   134 million   up 845  from a year before 
Uros has also developed an integrated e sim technology adopted by mobile phone manufacturers such as Motorola  NYSE MSI  and China s ZTE  HK 0763  that allows phone users to subscribe to services of several different operators simultaneously 
Raatikainen said the world s leading chip manufacturer  Qualcomm Technologies  has taken on Uros as a partner in its smart cities accelerator program alongside U S  based technology firms such as  Verizon Communications   NYSE VZ  to develop smart street lights  parking solutions and connected devices

108503,330018,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm Boosts Self Driving  Ericsson s IoT Drive   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks trended down as geopolitical tensions rattled the market and threatened to spoil the initial euphoria associated with the likely signing of the  Phase One  trade deal between the United States and China  With oil prices expected to remain highly volatile until the Middle East conflicts deescalate  the industry is poised to face sterner tests as the year gradually progresses  In addition  heightened cybersecurity threats have created a feeling of mistrust and fueled uncertainty within the rank and files of the sector   A Chinese trade delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He is slated to touch the American shores next week for the formal inking of the partial trade accord  This follows the recent report that revealed that U S  trade deficit has fallen to a three year low  largely due to higher exports and lower import basket  primarily led by a decline of imports from China  Thanks to the  Phase One  deal  the trade deficit is likely to dip further as China has reportedly pledged to purchase  200 billion of goods over the next two years  including  40  50 billion of agricultural products each year Just when it seemed that the worst is almost over for the beleaguered industry  a fresh turmoil in the Middle East erupted with the Trump administration assassinating a top Iranian general through drone attacks  and Iran retaliating with missile attacks at U S  airbases in Iraq  Although both countries have stepped back from the brink of a war  a shadow warfare and proxy wars could take centerstage as cybersecurity threat intensifies  Iran has historically launched several potent cyberattacks  breaching United States  cyber defenses and potentially harming finance  telecom and energy sectors  Despite significant technological advances  several smaller U S  firms are still vulnerable to such attacks  risking the safety and security of sensitive data  This  in turn  has created an element of insecurity within the industry  triggering a downtrend In order to avert potential cyber aggression with increased 5G deployment  the House of Representatives passed three bipartisan 5G security bills in the past week that had advanced through the Committee last year  These include the Secure 5G and Beyond Act  which entails the administration to create an  unclassified national strategy  to protect consumers and allies from potential threats to 5G systems  thereby protecting the  competitiveness  of U S  firms  Two other bipartisan bills   the Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act and Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act   would require the administration to become more involved in international standard setting bodies around wireless networks  This is likely to encourage participation by U S  firms and other stakeholders in developing standards for 5G networks and future generations of communications networks Meanwhile  a U S  lawmaker has introduced a bill to prevent sharing of key intelligence with countries that allow Chinese telecommunication equipment manufacturer Huawei to operate 5G network technology within their borders  The strategic move is the latest ploy by the United States to thwart the growing emergence of Huawei as 5G deployment picks up pace across the globe Regarding company specific news  autonomous driving solutions  digitization  customer growth statistics and guidance update took the center stage over the past five trading

108506,330021,MSI,Near Term Headwinds Mar Wireless Equipment Industry Outlook,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions  wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms  The firms within this industry are driving the transition of global enterprises to smart virtual networks by creating an integrated network for all services  converging mobile and fixed broadband  IP routing and optical networks with software and services to manage them  Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices  chips  and system software for wireless voice and data communications  analog and digital two way radio  satellite telecommunications  wireless networking and signal processing equipment and end to end enterprise mobility solutions  In addition  the firms provide a broad range of routing  switching and security products along with video surveillance and machine to machine communication components that secure VPN appliances  enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft for seamless transfer The industry participants facilitate users to shift their telecom networks to the latest 5G standards  including new use cases like IoT  public safety and fixed wireless access  Along with hands on field service operations to remote network operations  the firms offer IT managed services for the management of applications and data centers  while network design and optimization services develop and expand user networks per demand  Apart from offering scalable networks that securely connect everyone and everything to the cloud  the firms help customers transform their operations and reduce the complexity of business  Some firms within the industry even provide electronic warfare  avionics  robotics  advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry  A few industry participants offer air traffic management solutions for the civil aviation industry and analytics for global and space situational awareness and Earth observation missions  Some notable firms within the industry are Qualcomm Incorporated  QCOM   Juniper Networks Inc  NYSE JNPR    JNPR  and Motorola Solutions Inc  NYSE MSI    MSI  Here are the three major themes in the industry      With the exponential growth of mobile broadband  user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased manifold  This has resulted in huge demand for advanced networking architecture  in turn  leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches  Hence  these companies are likely to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks to support the incremental growth in data traffic  Further  to maintain superior performance as traffic increases  there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization  creating demand for state of the art wireless products and services  Also  the industry participants are likely to benefit from expanding media coverage  increasing demand for reliable access and fast data services  thereby broadening customer base and translating into higher revenues for the overall industry      The continued deployment of 5G technology across the globe is likely to propel the industry to newer heights  Moreover  5G is likely to augment the scalability  security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry  which is expected to propel the wide proliferation of IoT  The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy of scale network operating model to demand driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments  Although these investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification  short term profitability has largely been compromised  Margins are likely to be affected by high cost level associated with the first generation 5G products  profitability challenges in China and pricing pressure in early 5G deals      Majority of the industry participants offers mission critical communication infrastructure  devices  accessories  software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce  These systems drive demand for additional device sales  software upgrades  infrastructure overhaul and expansion  as well as additional services to maintain  monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions  The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communications operations  However  paucity of demand due to geopolitical uncertainty and challenging macroeconomic environment has dented the margins of most industry participants  Intense price wars due to rising costs of raw materials and stiff competition have added to woes  High technological obsolescence of most products has also escalated operating costs with continuous investments in R D Overall  although the industry has inherent growth potential  it appears to be mired in short term headwinds and uncertainty  with significant capital expenditures and price wars eroding margins Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  196  which places it at the bottom 23  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is

factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at

108550,330065,MSI,World s Worst Tech Stock Lenovo May Lose Hang Seng Spot,news," Bloomberg     Lenovo Group Ltd  is increasingly at risk of being dropped from Hong Kong s benchmark equity index as its shares tumble more than any other technology company in the world 
The Chinese computer maker has slumped 56 percent since being added to the Hang Seng Index in March 2013  wiping out  5 8 billion in value  Companies removed from the gauge in the past decade have seen their value fall a median 48 percent before being excluded  according to Bloomberg calculations 
Lenovo sank to its lowest level since October 2009 on Monday as a U S  ban on communications equipment maker ZTE Corp  and a global selloff by hardware manufacturers added to jitters about China s technology sector  Its shares were up 0 5 percent as of 9 52 a m  in Hong Kong on Tuesday 
The stock is one of the most shorted on the Hang Seng Index  13 8 percent of Lenovo s shares available for trade on loan to short sellers  according to IHS Markit Ltd  Removal from the gauge could spur more outflows from Lenovo  as at least  107 billion worth of passive funds track the Hang Seng Index  data compiled by Bloomberg show 
 Risks that Lenovo will lose its seat are on the rise   said Kenny Wen  a strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co  in Hong Kong   Lenovo is having trouble in all key areas  from issuing cool smartphone models to keeping market share in computer businesses  The short sellers may have picked the right target this time  
Dropped Before
The Beijing based company was previously dropped from the Hang Seng Index in 2006  six years after first joining  Its decline since it was added back in 2013 is the biggest on the 171 member Bloomberg World Technology Index 
Lenovo said in an email that it doesn t comment on its share price or speculation  The company s chief executive Yang Yuanqing is maintaining a bullish stance  saying in a WeChat post last week that Lenovo was back on track for growth  The firm posted a loss in the December quarter after it was hit with a U S  tax charge and as its mobile business continued to struggle having rapidly surrendering market share 
Concern is rising that Lenovo will have to write off the value of its intangible assets  as smartphone unit Motorola  NYSE MSI  is delivering lackluster results  according to Kevin Chen  a Hong Kong based analyst with Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd  The company s data center business is being closely watched as that s the most promising area for helping a turnaround and cushioning the stock s decline  he said 
 Last year was supposed to be the year for Lenovo to hit the bottom and start seeing improvement    but we didn t see it   Chen said   Investors are losing patience

What s Next for Motorola

108564,330079,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Verizon Beats On Q3 Earnings  AT T s 3 Year View   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a downtrend as fresh developments threatened to jeopardize the proposed  Phase One  deal between the United States and China   The partial trade accord was likely to ease the bilateral tensions created by the prolonged trade war  However  simmering tensions and political undercurrents raised speculations about a probable signing of an agreement in mid November between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart  In addition  lower than expected earnings performance and relatively soft outlook from hitherto declared results have triggered uncertainty within the beleaguered sector The FCC has formulated draft proposals that intend to bar U S  telecom firms from using funds from its Universal Services Fund to buy equipment from such companies that are deemed to be national security threats  The agency is also working out the finer details of a policy that would enable domestic firms to rip off equipment from Chinese telecom manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763  to eliminate the threat of data espionage  The FCC is scheduled to vote on the proposals on Nov 19  before they are forwarded to the President for formal approval The  economic bullying  at a critical juncture of the trade negotiation process has cast a shadow on the  Phase One  deal as China has raised objections to such unilateral move without any concrete evidence  Moreover  the sudden cancellation of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile due to the political turmoil within the country has created a new obstacle for the Sino U S  relations  The White House is reportedly seeking some alternate venues for signing the initial trade agreement  although no official location has yet been confirmed  The U S  government is also considering extending the tariff exemptions on  34 billion worth of Chinese imports that are slated expire at the end of this year Although both sides remain intent to reach a consensus deal at the earliest on domestic compulsions  it appears that the trade war has been rather a  two steps forward  three steps backward  affair  This  in turn  has largely dragged the sector down despite the fact that the S P is hovering around record high territories backed by broad based expectations of a trade settlement and the Fed s interest rate cut Regarding company specific news  quarterly earnings primarily took the center stage over the past five trading days Recap of the Week s Most Important

108569,330084,MSI,Harmonic  HLIT  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Harmonic  HLIT  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 26 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  8 1 in the previous session  Harmonic has gained 64 8  since the start of the year compared to the 26 4  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 20 2  return for the Zacks Communication   Components industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 28  2019  Harmonic reported EPS of  0 25 versus consensus estimate of  0 22 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 74  
For the current fiscal year  Harmonic is expected to post earnings of  0 25 per share on  393 78 million in revenues  This represents a 31 58  change in EPS on a  2 42  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  0 31 per share on  445 95 million in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 24  and 13 25   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Harmonic may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Harmonic has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 32 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 22 3X versus its peer group s average of 17 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 73  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Harmonic currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Harmonic meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Harmonic shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Harmonic Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Harmonic have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Communications Systems  JCS   Zayo Group Holdings  ZAYO   and Motorola Solutions  NYSE MSI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Harmonic  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-11-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/harmonic-hlit-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200481806,200481806
108571,330086,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Intelsat Stock Dips  Vodafone s Cloud Foray  Other Updates,opinion,Telecom stocks  downtrend continued over the past five trading days  as negotiations between high level officials of the United States and China failed to come up with a consensus agreement on the various stumbling blocks  Investors appear jittery as speculations about the  Phase One  deal being signed off has gained steam  with President Trump threatening to further raise tariffs in a worst case scenario The partial trade accord is widely anticipated to ease the bilateral tensions created by the prolonged trade war  However  the communist nation s demands to roll back the existing U S  tariffs cast doubts over a probable signing of an agreement between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart  In addition  various roadblocks related to forced technology transfer and IP protection  along with the lack of clarity on the quantum of U S  farm products purchase by China on a monthly or yearly basis clouded the negotiation process  While both sides remain intent to reach an agreement at the earliest on domestic compulsions  it appears that the trade war has been rather a  two steps forward  three steps backward  affair  This  in turn  has largely dragged the sector down Meanwhile  the U S  administration has extended the deadline for a sweeping ban on trade with Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei by another 90 days  allowing domestic firms and rural carriers to utilize the window to purchase replacement parts and software  This marks the third such instance when the reprieve was extended since the U S  Commerce Department added Huawei to the  Entity List  in May  citing national security concerns  At the same time  the government reportedly approved a quarter of nearly 300 license applications by U S  firms to trade with the beleaguered telecom firm  Although the names of the recipients of trade licenses have been kept under wraps  it is told that only those applications were approved that posed no significant risks to national security Company specific news  government actions  technology collaborations  network modernization and

auctioning of the C band to start no later than year end 2020  and sharing at least half of the proceeds with the FCC  With the FCC Chairman Ajit Pai publicly supporting this view  shares went on a

108590,330105,MSI,High tech lenders target the decades old store credit card,news,"By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The once hot online lending industry has been battered by scandal and losses since last year  but one of the oldest forms of lending   store credit   is increasingly attracting tech companies aiming to supplant a retailer s credit card  One such lender  San Francisco startup Affirm  is attracting investment and large customers by using a new approach to underwriting that allows it to approve more borrowers than traditional store credit cards   Max Levchin  Affirm s founder who also co founded one of the earliest digital payments companies  PayPal  boasts that Affirm approves 126 percent more borrowers than Synchrony Financial  the largest issuer of private label credit cards   Merchants have enjoyed the boost in sales  Affirm recently finalized a deal to become the exclusive financing option for customers of mobile phone company Motorola  NYSE MSI   replacing Motorola s private label credit card   As of August  the most recent data available from a case study by the companies  purchases made with Affirm s loans represented 19 percent of all Motorola s sales   The point of sale market is monstrous   said Peter Renton  an independent industry analyst who hosts an online lending conference called LendIt   But it s been really low tech   Companies like Affirm are using smartphone apps  online messaging with borrowers and instantaneous approvals  removing the paperwork from retail lending   Synchrony did not respond to requests for comment  Reuters was not able to independently verify Affirm s claim of loan approval rates   Some industry watchers worry about the fallout of risky lending  Affirm  which is not profitable  has not yet been tested by a downturn in the economy    Long history will tell you  you have to be skeptical of someone saying they ve cracked the code on underwriting   said Todd Baker  a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School and a consultant for financial services companies   You really won t know until the credit cycle turns   Long before the internet  stores such as Sears offered credit cards  and some built profitable financing arms  Private label cards can provide stores with valuable consumer data and lower processing fees than general purpose credit cards  The total balance on store cards roughly doubled between 2007 and 2015 in the United States to  84 billion  according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  But while people are buying more on credit  fewer people are opening new store accounts  with the number of accounts down from 2007  The average in store credit card has a 26 38 percent interest rate  with jeweler Zales and department store Big Lots  NYSE BIG  Inc topping the list at 30 percent  according to a survey this year by CreditCards com    MORE APPROVALS AND MORE SALES   That has left an opening for tech companies touting what they claim to be more transparent  economical and convenient financial products in one of the few bright spots in online lending   Other parts of the industry  particularly marketplace lending  have suffered from controversy and poor performance  For instance  LendingClub Corp s CEO was forced to resign last year after a scandal over its loan selling practices  and the company s market capitalization has collapsed from more than  9 billion in 2014 to about  1 7 billion  Competing with Affirm is Klarna  founded in Sweden in 2005  which offers deferred payments and installment loans at more than 70 000

worth of imports from China  effective September  in addition to the existing set of tariffs  after the bilateral trade negotiations failed to yield any concrete result However  in a dramatic turnaround  the U S  President has opted to delay taxing some items within the new import basket until Dec 15  These include cellphones  video game consoles  computer monitors  some clothing and footwear items that formed a sizeable portion of the consumer shopping basket  The strategic decision is aimed to offer some respite to the retailers and enable them to stockpile things for the back to school and holiday season  Although this is likely to benefit the industry as 5G deployment across the country gains pace  the continued tariff war is expected to affect the supply chain of various

108626,330141,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm Plans Low Priced 5G Chips  CenturyLink s Deal   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks have rallied slowly but steadily on both the United States and China s positive approach to ease bilateral tensions and pave the way for earlier settlement of trade disputes  The two countries have also agreed to meet in person in October  with vice premier Liu He traveling to the United States for negotiations with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer  However  the bonhomie is likely to be put to test once the two sides sit across the negotiation table The communist nation extended an olive branch to the Trump administration by publicizing a short list of U S  goods from the import basket that will be spared from retaliatory tariffs for a year starting next week  These included items such as cancer drugs  lubricants  pesticides and shrimp meal  while big ticket commodities like soybeans and other agricultural goods were kept within the tariff list  China further announced that tariffs already imposed on the excluded list would be refunded with additional exemptions on other products on the anvil Trump reciprocated by postponing his own set of tariffs that were due to be levied from October by about two weeks as  a gesture of good will   He announced that a proposed hike in tariff rates from 25  to 30  on  250 billion worth of imports from China would be deferred to Oct 15 at the behest of the vice premier and honor the sentiments of the country that would be celebrating the 70th Anniversary on Oct 1  This  in turn  is likely to offer the negotiators ample time to reconcile their differences and come up with a mutually agreeable solution In another positive development  leading Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei has dropped a lawsuit against the U S  government after the latter returned goods seized in September 2017  The seized equipment included computer servers  Ethernet switches and other telecom gear that were on its way back to China after being tested in California  However  the Trump administration is still apparently sitting on about 130 applications received by the Commerce Department for issue of licenses for the trade of U S  goods with Huawei Meanwhile  the Federal Communications Commission is reportedly mulling to auction hitherto unavailable mid band spectrum to telecom carriers  which is likely to accelerate the 5G rollout across the country  The auctioning of 70 MHz of the 3 5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service band in June 2020 will enable the telecom firms to deploy 5G network facilities with fewer cell sites  The mid band spectrum enables wider coverage compared to mmWave spectrum as its frequency travels further and can better penetrate buildings  This is likely to bridge the digital divide in rural areas and bring 5G coverage across extended areas  Regarding company specific news  product launches

108628,330143,MSI,Near Term Wireless Equipment Industry Outlook Appears Murky,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions  wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms  The firms within this industry are driving the transition of global enterprises to smart virtual networks by creating an integrated network for all services  converging mobile and fixed broadband  IP routing and optical networks with software and services to manage them  Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices  chips  and system software for wireless voice and data communications  analog and digital two way radio  wireless broadband systems and end to end enterprise mobility solutions  In addition  the firms provide a broad range of routing  switching and security products that secure VPN appliances  enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft for seamless data transfer The industry participants facilitate users to shift their telecom networks to the latest 5G standards   including new use cases like IoT  public safety and fixed wireless access  Along with hands on field service operations to remote network operations  the firms offer IT managed services for the management of applications and data centers  while network design and optimization services develop and expand user networks per demand  Apart from offering scalable networks that securely connect everyone and everything to the cloud  the firms help customers transform their operations and reduce the complexity of business  Some firms within the industry even provide electronic warfare  avionics  robotics  advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry  A few industry participants offer air traffic management solutions for the civil aviation industry and analytics for global and space situational awareness and Earth observation missions  Some notable firms within the industry are Qualcomm Incorporated  QCOM   Juniper Networks Inc  NYSE JNPR    JNPR  and Motorola Solutions Inc  NYSE MSI    MSI  Here are the three major themes in the industry      With the exponential growth of mobile broadband  user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased manifold  This has resulted in growing need for advanced networking architecture  in turn  leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches  Hence  these companies are likely to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks to support the incremental growth in data traffic  Further  to maintain superior performance as traffic increases  there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization  creating demand for state of the art wireless products and services  Also  the industry participants are likely to benefit from expanding media coverage  improving customer service and competitive cost structure  thereby generating higher average revenue per user  Increasing demand for reliable access and fast data services are further expected to broaden customer base  translating into higher revenues for the overall industry      The continued deployment of 5G technology across the globe is likely to propel the industry to newer heights  5G is billed as the technology of the future with faster download speed and seamless transfer of data  Leveraging state of the art communication network architectures  5G is touted to be the primary catalyst for next generation IoT services  These include connected cars  augmented reality and virtual reality platform  smart cities and connected devices that will revolutionize key industry verticals  Moreover  5G is likely to augment the scalability  security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry  which is expected to propel the wide proliferation of IoT  The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy of scale network operating model to demand driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation  Rollouts of next generation 5G networks are anticipated to improve market conditions significantly in 2019 and beyond      A majority of the industry participants offers mission critical communication infrastructure  devices  accessories  software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce  These systems drive demand for additional device sales  software upgrades  infrastructure refresh and expansion  as well as additional services to maintain  monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions  The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communications operations  However  trade hostilities related to tariffs and counter tariffs by two of the most powerful economic powerhouses of the world have dented the profitability of the industry  and shrouded it in uncertainty  Tense Sino U S  relations have also affected the supply chain management of various firms and led to loss of businesses due to several trade restrictions Overall  although the industry has inherent growth potential  tense bilateral trade relations between the United States and China have rendered a relatively grim picture for the near future Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  169  which places it at the bottom 34  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates discouraging prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing faith in this

108646,330161,MSI,Scared by Trump  some migrants on Mexico border give up American dream,news,"By David Alire Garcia NOGALES  Mexico  Reuters    Donald Trump s election victory and his plans to crack down on illegal immigration is so troubling for the groups of men gathered just south of a rusty  towering fence on the U S  Mexico border that some are even considering going home  For most poor Central Americans and Mexicans at travelers  shelters in the desert town of Nogales  Trump s threats to build a wall along the whole border and deport millions of illegal immigrants have not made them abandon their harrowing journeys and hopes of a better life in the north   But for some like Juan Alberto Lopez  the prospect of living in a country they believe will become more hostile to people like them no longer holds enough appeal to make the risky crossing across the desolate Arizona borderland   Now everything s changed   said the despondent Lopez  25  as he sat staring blankly at the ground in outside one migrant center  under a cobalt sky  Lopez hails from the southern state of Chiapas  Mexico s poorest  and lived for two years in Arizona and Utah working in construction before being deported in January  Under one of Trump s proposals  he would face a two year federal prison sentence for returning after deportation  He had decided to go back to the United States when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was projected to win the election  Now  he plans to seek work in Nogales instead  or go home    They re going to detain all the migrants  and if it s like that  it s better to stay here with your own people  be happy  and just endure it   he added  echoing the sentiments of a third of more than a dozen migrants interviewed by Reuters in Nogales following Trump s victory  In running for president  Trump promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants as well as build a wall along the border to stop others entering the United States  and make Mexico pay for it  His uncompromising stance helped drive a rush over the U S  border as some migrants calculated it was better to cross over before the election in case Trump won  That could continue in coming months even as some like Lopez decide they no longer want to live in the United States  During fiscal year 2016  which ended in September  the number of people detained along the U S  Mexico border surpassed 408 000  a 23 percent jump from last year  although it was less than in 2014  official U S  data published last month showed   I really don t care about President Trump  I m always going to cross regardless of any walls he wants   said Alexi Solano  20  a migrant from El Salvador  whose wife and young son are already in Los Angeles   That doesn t matter to us  What we want is to be together with our families   Mexico s deputy interior minister for migration  Humberto Roque Villanueva  said he expected that flow to peak in 2016 as Trump will ramp up already tough deportation policies applied by President Barack Obama   A certain radicalization of the North American immigration policy is coming   Roque Villanueva said  THUGS AND SNAKES  In Nogales  a city of 230 000 dotted with factories of multinational firms like Motorola  NYSE MSI  and B E Aerospace  migrants say people smugglers typically charge  4 000 per person for a one way ticket across the border  As with long stretches of the 2 000 mile  3 200 km  border  a 25 foot tall fence already exists along the international boundary here  built in 2011 and made up of thick rust colored metal beams that follow the rocky terrain for miles to the west and east of the city   Beyond the fence on the U S  side  a parallel set of wooden posts are topped with cameras and sensors  In the distance  U S  immigration vehicles slowly patrol the border   Some 25 miles  40 km  to the east of town  the towering fence comes to an end and is replaced with a waist high barrier that mainly serves to stop trucks plowing through the desert  While some migrants trudge around the barricade  risking weather exposure on foot through rugged terrain menaced by drug cartel thugs and poisonous snakes  others opt to ride hidden in trucks that drive through official crossings  a route made possible  several said  by bribes  Maria Engracia Robles  a Roman Catholic nun who runs El Comedor center for deportees and migrants within sight of the border fence in Nogales  thinks Trump s victory will likely bring more hardship and worries about the challenges that mass deportations would bring    More anguish  tears  laments  and lots of people in Mexico without work  without anything to do and no place to go   said Robles  whose center provides free meals  clothes and basic medical care  Braced against the dry wind  dozens of hungry migrants line up around El Comedor s entrance for breakfast each morning  On Thursday  two men just inside the shelter could be overheard on mobile phones asking for a coyote  or human trafficker  to attempt another crossing   Here there is no work  and salaries are terrible   said Robles   The U S  Mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet  with average U S  wages about five times higher than Mexican wages   Further south  in Central America  incomes are even lower  and crime worse  fueling a surge of migration in recent years  More Central American migrants were apprehended on the U S  southern border than Mexicans this year   Jose Flores  19  a Honduran migrant who set out for the United States three months ago  ticked off the perils posed by violent gangs and dismal job prospects in his home country   I imagine it s going to get a lot harder to cross   he said   But what hasn t changed is we re looking for a better life

What s Next for Motorola 
While Motorola has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Motorola was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

108717,330232,MSI,The Washington insiders who work to get Chinese deals approved,news,"By Diane Bartz and Greg Roumeliotis WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    A spate of proposed Chinese takeovers of U S  companies  from the Chicago Stock Exchange to makers of high end semiconductors  has created a vibrant business for a small circuit of Washington insiders who advise on how to get cross border deals approved by the U S  government  Several former U S  officials have in recent years joined the ranks of lawyers  consultants and lobbyists that have emerged as key brokers in trying to get Chinese acquisitions or investments in U S  companies approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   which scrutinizes deals for national security concerns  Because this interagency panel  comprising 16 U S  government departments or agencies and chaired by the Treasury  does not publish its decisions or its reasoning for them  advisers say inside knowledge and connections are important to navigate what outsiders often see as a  black box  review process  There have been 22 M A transactions announced in the United States so far in 2016 involving Chinese acquirers  worth a combined  23 billion  according to Thomson Reuters data  That is a massive increase from 88 deals worth  13 billion for all of 2015  and 88 deals for  7 billion in 2014  For a graphic showing Chinese acquisitions of U S  companies by number and value  see  It has all boosted corporate demand for former officials who served on CFIUS or have knowledge of the inner workings of the agency  several lawyers  consultants and lobbyists involved in the advisory work told Reuters   We re just completely overwhelmed   said one lawyer involved in advising on the CFIUS process  who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media  China s aggressive  often state backed overseas buying spree has set off alarm bells among some politicians in Washington who are already on edge as China s armed forces expand their presence in the South China Sea and because of high profile hacking attacks against U S  government agencies and corporations  which U S  officials and security software companies have blamed on China  Adding to the tensions are attacks on China s trade policy  and in particular its surplus with the U S   by Donald Trump  who is leading the race to be the Republican candidate in November s presidential election  Among the former officials who use their CFIUS experience in advisory work are Anne Salladin  who reviewed some 500 deals that went to CFIUS during her 20 years at the Treasury  Her role at law firm Stroock   Stroock   Lavan LLP has included advising a Chinese private equity firm on the acquisition of some semiconductor related assets  Other officials include former U S  Treasury deputy assistant secretary for investment security and policy Nova Daly  now with the law firm Wiley Rein LLP  and former Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for policy Stewart Baker  now with law firm Steptoe   Johnson LLP  according to the websites of their employers   Baker worked on the acquisition of Motorola  N MSI  Mobility by Chinese PC and smartphone maker Lenovo Group  HK 0992  in 2014  while Daly advised U S  hard disk maker  Western Digital  Corp  O WDC  on a proposed investment by China s Unisplendour Corp Ltd  000938 SZ  that was abandoned this week amid CFIUS concerns  All three of the former officials declined to comment for this story  Whitney Smith  a Treasury spokesperson  declined to comment on CFIUS s relationship with company advisors  GAUGING SENTIMENT Before a deal is announced  the advisors will often seek to gauge its chances for CFIUS approval by holding a preliminary meeting with key officials  If the initial reaction is hostile  then this can avoid the embarrassment and cost of announcing a deal that is later scuppered  said Mark Plotkin  a CFIUS expert with the law firm Covington   Burling LLP  A good CFIUS advisor will figure out what issues might crop up in a certain deal   such as cutting edge chip technology or Pentagon contracts    and discuss how to best handle these with the agencies most likely to be concerned  said Plotkin   The CFIUS process is going to be a full body X ray of the target   he said  Another lawyer involved in CFIUS work  who spoke privately  said that he gives a 45 minute presentation to Pentagon officials and then carefully examines the questions asked  as well as body language  to judge their level of discomfort with a particular deal  It is not unlike a preliminary meeting that antitrust lawyers might request with the Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission about an antitrust review of a merger  the lawyers said  Not all CFIUS advisors are hired to help a deal go through  Some are brought in by corporate competitors to lobby against a deal  while others are tapped by investors making bets on whether a transaction will be cleared by CFIUS  For instance  Mario Mancuso  a partner at law firm Kirkland   Ellis LLP who formerly sat on CFIUS as undersecretary of commerce for industry and security  now typically advises companies  But he also represented some investors in pork producer Smithfield Foods when China s Shuanghui International made a successful bid for the company in 2013  MORE WILLING TO HIRE This CFIUS advisory business is also benefiting from Chinese companies  new willingness to spend on advisors  Traditionally  Chinese companies had been mistrustful of advisors  or unwilling to pay for them  some investment bankers and lawyers say  But the Chinese government s encouragement of outbound deal making has spurred many of the country s companies to spend on advisors  including CFIUS experts  these people say  A CFIUS review typically lasts between one and three months and can cost from as little as  50 000 to as much as  1 million for more complicated or controversial transactions  according to a CFIUS expert who has shepherded deals through the process  China led the pack of countries whose planned U S  acquisitions and investments in 2014 were probed for U S  security implications  making it the most scrutinized country by CFIUS  according to the latest CFIUS annual report  which was released last Friday  No official data is available for 2015  Chinese bids for technology and chip makers get particular scrutiny  CFIUS experts say  Semiconductors form electronic cores for a long list of military systems  including drones  guided missiles and bombs  To be sure  even with expert advice  companies can get it wrong  In the case of Western Digital  the company had told investors that it believed Unisplendour acquiring a 15 percent non controlling stake would not be subject to a CFIUS review But CFIUS informed Western Digital it would review the transaction nonetheless  prompting Unisplendour to pull out  CFIUS concerns also killed other semiconductor deals in the past few weeks  Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc  O FCS  earlier this month rejected an acquisition offer from China Resources Microelectronics Ltd  and Hua Capital Management Co Ltd  over concerns that CFIUS would stop the deal  Last month  Philips  AS PHG  scrapped a  3 3 billion deal to sell a division which makes LED lights to Chinese investors also because of CFIUS concerns  U S  politicians have also began to agitate over some of these deals  Last week  a group of 46 U S  lawmakers urged CFIUS to take a hard look at a bid by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group to buy the Chicago Stock Exchange because of concerns that China would gain access to information about U S  companies  COTTAGE INDUSTRY The cottage industry that has developed around CFIUS includes a wide array of actors  Law firms such as Skadden  Arps  Slate  Meagher   Flom LLP and Covington   Burling offer to provide insight into how CFIUS will view a deal  tapping into their working relationships with CFIUS officials at several government departments  Skadden declined comment for this story  Lobbying firms  including Podesta Group and BGR Group  both of whom boast CFIUS experts on their websites  seek to persuade lawmakers and U S  officials that a transaction is not threatening  as any concerns they harbor can trickle down to CFIUS officials  according to industry sources  BGR declined to comment  while Podesta did not respond to requests for comment  Management consulting firms  such as Accenture Plc  N ACN  and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd  offer to help companies address national security risks identified by CFIUS  So called  mitigation measures  can range from asset sales to ensuring that only U S  citizens perform certain tasks  Deloitte declined to comment  Sorting out who among the advisors have connections and insight into CFIUS is not always easy  
 Some of the law firms specializing in this stuff are excellent  while others sign companies on for terms that are utterly unimplementable   said Accenture consultant Andrew Walker  who helps companies comply with conditions imposed by CFIUS ",2016-02-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-washington-insiders-who-work-to-get-chinese-deals-approved-386344,386344

 Reuters    Motorola  NYSE MSI  Mobility said a U S  jury ordered the company to pay  10 2 million in damages for using Fujifilm Corp s patented technology in its phones without permission 
Fujifilm Corp  a subsidiary of Tokyo based Fujifilm Holdings Corp  sued Motorola in 2012  accusing the company of infringing three of its patents on digital camera functions and a fourth patent relating to transmitting data over a wireless connection such as Bluetooth 
The damages the jury ordered on Monday were lesser than the  40 million Fujifilm sought while going into the trial  which began on April 20 
The jury in San Francisco said Motorola  a unit of China s Lenovo Group  proved that three of the disputed patents   two on face recognition and one on WiFi bluetooth were invalid  Motorola failed to prevail on a patent related to converting color images to monochrome 
 We are pleased with the verdict related to three out of the four patents and are evaluating our options on the one patent on which we did not prevail   Motorola spokesman William Moss said in an email 
A spokeswoman for Fujifilm did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Motorola  which Lenovo bought from  Google Inc   NASDAQ GOOGL  last year  had argued that the Fujifilm patents should be canceled because they were not actually new or they were obvious compared to previously patented inventions  The company also argued it already held a license to Bluetooth technology

 By Deepa Seetharaman
 NEW YORK  Feb 1  Reuters    Investors are hoping swift
action on an economic stimulus plan will boost Wall Street this
week after its worst January ever 
 The stream of bleak news reached fever pitch after U S 
companies shed more than 200 000 jobs in January and some
investors worried a plan to shore up banks may take longer to
come together 
 The nation s recovery hopes have been placed squarely on
the shoulders of lawmakers in Washington  where the U S 
Senate will begin a closely watched debate this week on the
 887 billion economic stimulus bill  after the House of
Representatives passed its version without a single Republican
vote 
  If they come up with a plan    any kind of plan    the
market will rally a little bit  this  week   said Warren
Simpson  managing director at Stephens Capital Management in
Little Rock  Arkansas 
 But Simpson cautioned that without a plan  stocks could
retest the November bear market lows  Indeed  David Kostin 
Goldman Sachs chief U S  equity strategist  said in a research
note that the S P 500 could challenge this low during the
first quarter of 2009 
  Everybody s nervous here   Simpson said

7 5 percent  according to ThomsonReuters estimates  That would
be the highest monthly jobless rate since September 1992 and
an increase from December s 7 2 percent  Economists expect
that U S  non farm payrolls shrank by 524 000 in January 
 Adding to the grim economic backdrop will be same store
sales expected from a slew of retailers on Thursday  Quarterly
results from companies  including drug maker Merck   Co 
mobile phone maker Motorola Inc  and No  1 U S  home builder
D R  Horton  could confirm this snapshot 
  Everyone knows the numbers are going to be bad  but what
we need to see is the direction policies are taking   said
Eric Kuby  chief investment officer at North Star Investment
Management Corp in Chicago 
  Washington can change the tone of the market  
 BANKS ON CENTER STAGE
 A broad rally among financials helped stocks early last
week  but the surge was derailed on Thursday after data showed
jobless claims scaled to a new high  while new home sales slid
to a record low 
 For the week  the Dow fell almost 1 percent  the S P 500
declined 0 7 percent and the Nasdaq dipped 0 1 percent 
 But the Dow and S P 500 recorded their worst January slide
in history  January performance is typically a harbinger for
stocks for the rest of the year 
 Financials will be a critical group this week as investors
nervously await any news on President Barack Obama s alternate
plans to prop up banks  balance sheets and the ongoing drama
surrounding the economic recovery legislation 
  The fiscal stimulus package buys us time until the
banking system is recapitalized   said David Joy  chief market
strategist at RiverSource Investments 
 Any delays in passing the package  would be a very big
setback for the stock market  no question   Joy said 
 Defaults on subprime mortgages led to losses on
mortgage related debt in the summer of 2007  triggering the
credit crunch and wreaking havoc in the banking sector that
led to the meltdown on Wall Street last year  The banking
turmoil and the recession  which began in late 2007  have
resulted in a sharp slowdown in bank lending and consumer
spending  and a rising tide of job losses  The president hopes
his stimulus package will mitigate the damage by helping the
economy begin to turn around 
 MONTHLY RETAIL SALES LOOK ANEMIC
 On Thursday  a slew of retailers will post same store
sales figures  which are expected to contract 2 4 percent in
January  Excluding discount retailer Wal Mart Stores Inc  sales
could shrink 5 7 percent 
 Investors will pay close attention to these numbers
because consumer spending makes up two thirds of the U S 
gross domestic product  which shrank 3 8 percent in the fourth
quarter    the fastest pace in nearly 27 years 
 The U S  housing sector    the root of the economic crisis
   will also be a focal point this week  although quarterly
results from top U S  home builders  D R  Horton and Pulte
Homes Inc  and Tuesday s data on pending home sales may not
yield many positives 
 The week will kick off with a look at personal income and
consumption  or spending  for December  plus the Institute for
Supply Management s January index of U S  manufacturing
activity  both due on Monday  The ISM s January index of U S 
non manufacturing  or service sector  activity is due on
Wednesday 
 In an effort to stave off the recession  now in its second
year  investors will look toward the Senate s debates on the
economic stimulus package  But there are many serious
stumbling blocks with Senate Republicans  led by former
presidential candidate and Arizona Sen  John McCain  who is
crafting an alternative package 
  We know that the banking industry is not aiding and
abetting spending   Joy said   If fiscal stimulus doesn t do
the job  where is the demand that will keep us afloat until
the banking system is healthy 
  This has to pass

 SINGAPORE  June 16  Reuters    South Korea s LG Electronics
Inc  066570 KS   the world s third largest mobile phone maker 
sees its mobile phone sales rising about 9 percent this year as
demand growth in Asia lifts the global market 
 Ma Chang  vice president for marketing strategy for LG s
mobile arm  said the global mobile market will hold up better
than expected to be flat or only slightly lower this year than
in 2008  with continued growth in Asia 
 He expected LG sales of 110 million units this year  rising
to more than 200 million by 2012 
  The figure shows that the downturn seems to be less
impactful  The total market size will be about the same for
2009 as in 2008   Ma told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday 
  I think Asia will grow in high single digits this year  
he said on the sidelines of a regional technology conference 
 The mobile market had been expected to shrink by up to 10
percent this year amid the global economic downturn  leaving
handset makers striving to prop up sales by focusing on a few
growth areas such as smartphones and emerging markets 
 The CEO of LG s mobile communications said last week the
company is aiming to maintain its market share at 10 percent
for this year and become the No 2 player by 2012 
 In handset terms  LG trails Nokia  and Samsung
Electronics  005930 KS   but is ahead of Motorola Inc 
and Sony Ericsson  6758 T   In 2008  LG sold 100 7
million phones and claimed about 9 percent market share 
  We can only project based on the current situation and the
current market share     but I think roughly more than 200
million units  That s the threshold we have   Ma said  when
asked about how big LG sales would be if it becomes the second
biggest industry player

109000,330515,MSI,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Motorola  MSI ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Motorola  NYSE MSI   which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry 
This communications equipment maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 8 46  
For the most recent quarter  Motorola was expected to post earnings of  1 15 per share  but it reported  1 28 per share instead  representing a surprise of 11 30   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 49 per share  while it actually produced  2 63 per share  a surprise of 5 62  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Motorola  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Motorola currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 25   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on August 1  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-motorola-msi-200444144,200444144
109001,330516,MSI,Motorola  MSI  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Motorola  NYSE MSI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This communications equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 85 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Motorola 
For Motorola  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 25  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Motorola will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Motorola would post earnings of  1 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 28  delivering a surprise of  11 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Motorola appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/motorola-msi-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200445018,200445018

109333,330848,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T Mulls Divestitures  Ericsson s Smart Factory   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks have witnessed a gradual uptrend due to a thaw in Sino U S  relationship as President Trump and his Chinese counterpart reached a trade war truce on the sidelines of G20 summit in Osaka  Japan  As China is a vital market for various telecom components  the resumption of bilateral trade talks is expected to buoy the industry that has borne the brunt of the tariff war  Moreover  easing of some of the trade restrictions on Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei brought a sense of relief to several U S  suppliers  and propelled the industry as a whole Just as the doctor ordered  Trump offered a much needed boost to the beleaguered telecom industry when he announced a ceasefire to his proposed plans to levy additional tariffs on  300 billion of remaining Chinese imports  Although the existing tariffs remained in place  both the state heads decided to resume the bilateral trade negotiations to prevent further escalation of conflicts  while extending olive branch to each other  While Trump agreed to ease some trade embargoes on Huawei  Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to buy an unspecified amount of U S  farm products  Led by intense lobbying by U S  suppliers that were handicapped by the strict government ban  the decision marked a significant shift from the earlier rigid stance of the respective leaders and underscored the domestic compulsions  While Trump is expected to gain mileage for his re election bid on higher farm produce export  Jinping is likely to benefit from the free flow of U S  components as the communist nation is battling muted economic growth Despite the outreach and visible camaraderie  not much has changed in reality as Huawei is still considered to be blacklisted by the enforcement staff of the U S  Commerce Department  The White House has further downplayed the trade concessions as one that are routine low tech items  unrelated to national security concerns  The Trump administration has also initiated a 150 day review process of the U S  telecommunications supply chain to ensure that 5G equipment used in the country is designed and manufactured outside China  The government is seeking an informal response from various equipment manufacturers to thwart any possible data espionage by eliminating purported attempts by Chinese engineers to insert security holes into technology made in China  The U S  officials are reportedly mulling to allow the manufacturing of benign analog components  such as power converters and protective cases in the communist nation  But they intend to restrict the same for  intelligent  components that deal with data intensive applications like cellular tower hardware  routers and switches   Nevertheless  the restoration of the bilateral trade negotiations has breathed a fresh lease of life in the industry  It remains to be seen how they pan out in the future and eliminate the various stumbling blocks that threaten to derail a significant breakthrough in the trade impasse   Regarding

109360,330875,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Harris Gets Merger Nod  BlackBerry s Q1 Results   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a relatively flat trajectory as the industry awaited an early resolution to the trade war on the proposed resumption of bilateral trade talks between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of G20 summit  The improvement in the Sino U S  relationship is expected to buoy the industry that has borne the brunt of the tariff war with various trade restrictions affecting the supply chain mechanism and risking business sustainability Despite the outreach and visible camaraderie  the Trump administration has initiated a 150 day review process of the U S  telecommunications supply chain to ensure that 5G

carriers are considering to tap its rivals Nokia  HE NOKIA  and Ericsson  BS ERICAs  to replace their banned equipment  However  negotiations to switch from low priced components to pricier alternatives are likely to be fruitful only when the Congress approves  700 million in subsidies for the changeover  The uncertainties have effectively put the sustainability of the rural wireless

109834,331349,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm  Motorola Trump Earnings Estimates   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks flattered to deceive as the initial uptrend driven by better than expected earnings was replaced by a gradual decline later in the week  triggered by a sudden breakdown in the bilateral trade talks with China  As the equity markets reeled under the likelihood of a fresh tariff regime  telecom stocks mirrored the broader market sentiments with uncertainty creeping in the sector Both the United States and China appeared to be close to reaching a sweeping trade deal that would end the skirmishes between the two countries and resolve the nine month old trade war that disrupted supply chains and weighed on the global economy  However  despite numerous rounds of high level trade negotiations between the U S  treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer with a Chinese delegation led by vice premier Liu He  a consensus decision was not reached Although the White House had then qualified the talks as encouraging and  making good headway   China reportedly backtracked on most of the thorny issues and the trade talks fell flat  With no imminent breakthrough evident  the Trump administration is set to increase tariff on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10  to 25   Additional tariffs on  325 billion worth of imports from the Communist nation are also on the anvil  This is likely to trigger retaliatory tariffs from China as well  increasing tensions between the superpowers   Meanwhile  the U S  government continued to up the ante against Chinese telecom firms as a senior official claimed that no executive order from Trump is necessary to explicitly ban Huawei from developing 5G networks across the country  He further backed the claim through support from the leading U S  telecom service providers as they vouched to shun Huawei from their 5G build out plans  The Federal Communications Commission is also slated to vote on an order to prevent China Mobile USA  a subsidiary of China Mobile  from providing telecommunications services in the United States Regarding company specific news

What s Next for Motorola

Buy ranked Eli Lily s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date  gaining  10  vs   1 9   The Zacks analyst thinks Lilly s revenue growth in 2019 will likely be driven by higher demand for its newer drugs including Trulicity  Jardiance  Taltz  Verzenio as well as new migraine drug  Emgality as some older drugs like Cialis face generic competition

110727,332242,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm Offers New Chip  Sprint s 5G Debut   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks continued to trend higher on optimism over a likely long term solution to the trade war  The bilateral trade talks between the United States and China seemed to strike the right chords over the past week as both sides signaled intentions to resolve their differences  The positive vibes impacted the equity markets and boosted investor sentiments  in turn  benefitting telecom stocks With significant progress in the negotiations  President Trump has reportedly extended the Mar 1 deadline to reach a sweeping agreement to end the trade skirmishes  A probable meeting between the top leaders of both the countries is also in the cards in late March  Trump further observed that key issues such as concerns related to technology transfer and intellectual property rights were ironed out  although no official statements were released in this regard  Media reports cited that commonality was reached on various matters that hitherto remained bone of contention between the two countries However  there seemed to be some lingering issues with difference of opinion on China s subsidies  cyber theft  public sector enterprises and so called forcible technology transfers  Common ground on a mutual enforcement mechanism remained particularly elusive  Although no apparent breakthrough has yet been made on such matters  the Trump administration maintained that the talks have been quite fruitful  Higher level meetings are scheduled to continue through the end of the week as both parties appear to be eager to walk the extra mile to strike a full scale accord Meanwhile  Trump has urged the telecom firms to up the ante in the 5G race and encouraged healthy competition with global firms to maintain a competitive edge  He also stated that efforts should be made not to stifle competition in a veiled reference to efforts against Chinese telecom equipment manufacturers like Huawei  Nevertheless  the United States is moving closer to give the final touches to an executive order that could offer sweeping powers to the Commerce Department to review imported products by domestic firms and ban the outright sale of such equipment on grounds of national security interests  Industry observers feel that it could ultimately serve as a knell to some Chinese telecom firms and make it virtually impossible for them to operate in the U S  shores if the bill is passed by President Trump  However  the proposed executive order is facing stiff opposition from rural telecom service providers that use low cost Chinese equipment like that of Huawei Regarding company specific news  product launches  5G deployment  acquisition and

A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For MSI  shares are up 14 36  over the past week while the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is up 0 54  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 20 16  compares favorably with the industry s 5 5  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Motorola have risen 10 9   and are up 31 06  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 57  and 5 32   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to MSI s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  MSI is currently averaging 1 205 284 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with MSI 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost MSI s consensus estimate  increasing from  7 53 to  7 63 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that MSI is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Motorola on your short list ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-motorola-msi-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200388044,200388044

Telecom Stock Roundup  MSI  UBNT  NOK and More
In the past five trading days  telecom stocks mostly traded flat for the bulk of the week owing to the continued market uncertainty triggered by trade related headwinds and no apparent headways in the recent U S  China bilateral talks  However  the stocks witnessed a steep rise at the end of the week as President Trump proposed to extend the Mar 1 deadline to reach a sweeping agreement to end the trade skirmishes  A probable meeting between the leaders of both the countries is also in the cards in the near future 
The high level trade negotiation between a team of U S  delegates headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and their Chinese counterparts led by vice premier Liu He commenced from Monday and is scheduled to run through the week  Although no apparent breakthrough has been made  the Trump administration maintained that the talks were quite fruitful  Notably  President Trump offered an olive branch with proposal for a likely extension to the deadline to give negotiators more time for a long term solution to the trade war  He also hinted that he could meet Chinese president Xi Jinping sometime later  to close the trade deal  Although specific discussions relating to restrictions for technology products remained muted  the industry cheered the positive developments 
Meanwhile  the government is moving closer to give the final touches to an executive order that could offer sweeping powers to the Commerce Department to review imported products by domestic firms and ban the outright sale of such equipment on grounds of national security interests  Industry observers feel that it could ultimately serve as a knell to some Chinese telecom firms and make it virtually impossible for them to operate in the U S  shores if the bill is passed by President Trump  However  the proposed executive order is facing stiff opposition from rural telecom service providers that use low cost Chinese equipment like that of Huwaei 
Regarding company specific news  earnings took the center stage over the past five trading days

110776,332291,MSI,Motorola  MSI  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Motorola Solutions  NYSE MSI   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 18 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  138 32 in the previous session  Motorola Solutions has gained 19 3  since the start of the year compared to the 11 5  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 3 5  return for the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 7  2019  Motorola reported EPS of  2 63 versus consensus estimate of  2 49 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 58  
For the current fiscal year  Motorola is expected to post earnings of  7 63 per share on  7 86 billion in revenues  This represents a 6 71  change in EPS on a 7 05  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  8 44 per share on  8 21 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 63  and 4 44   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Motorola may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Motorola has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 6X versus its peer group s average of 12 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 25  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Motorola currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Motorola fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Motorola shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/motorola-msi-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200387375,200387375

110797,332312,MSI,Can Solid Wireless Traction Buoy Verizon  VZ  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is scheduled to release fourth quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 29  The company is poised to witness solid traction from the impending 5G boom and is likely to record higher year over year revenues from the Wireless segment  which accounts for the lion s share of total revenues Whether this will benefit the bottom line of the company remains to be seen Top Line ExpansionVerizon offers one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States  The telecom behemoth continues to deploy the latest 4G LTE advanced technologies to deliver faster peak data speeds and capacity for customers  driven by customer focused planning  disciplined engineering and constant strategic investments  Backed by these initiatives  the company has reportedly generated 1 2 million retail postpaid net additions in the quarter with phone churn rate of 0 82   indicating continued strong customer loyalty During the quarter  Verizon launched the world s first commercial 5G broadband Internet service in select markets  Dubbed Verizon 5G Home  the service was initially made available in select regions in Houston  Indianapolis  Los Angeles and Sacramento  Verizon 5G Home service is built on the world s first and only 5G Ultra Wideband Network  offering typical network speeds around 300 Mbps and peak speeds of nearly 1 Gbps with no data caps  It combines end to end fiber network with a large deployment of small cells for improved connectivity and millimeter wave bandwidth to realize the full 5G potential for capacity  throughput and latency Verizon is using millimeter wave spectrum  radio signals  instead of copper or fiber cables to provide customers with unmatched wireless speeds for Internet access  The company has started conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with partners  It is looking at mobile hotspot and home based fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the United States  A full phased 5G wireless network is likely to be offered in 2020 while the company is aiming to launch commercial 5G smartphones in first half 2019  in collaboration with electronics firm Samsung  KS 005930  Verizon expects considerable growth in both its Wireless and Wireline businesses  going forward  The company anticipates healthy improvement in margins on the back of continued strong FiOS fiber optic network and strategic services in the Wireline business  Also  it is looking forward to capitalize on the countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things and telematics ecosystem across multiple industries  Further  the company s current focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising should drive growth Buoyed by such tailwinds  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues in the Wireless segment in the to be reported quarter is currently pegged at  24 614 million  which is relatively higher than the year ago reported figure of  23 771 million  The higher revenue expectations can be attributed to an uptick in demand and an upgrade to state of the art infrastructure Total revenues for the company are expected to be  34 321 million  It generated revenues of  33 955 million in the prior year quarter Other Key FactorsVerizon will write off a majority of its media business   Oath   which includes Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  and AOL  due to lower than expected performance from the combination of businesses that make up Oath  The telecom giant decided to take  4 6 billion   4 5 billion after tax  charge of the  4 8 billion of Oath s remaining goodwill balance  related to its media assets in the fourth quarter In an effort to expand its customer base  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and is also offering lucrative discounts  These strategies are likely to have affected the company s EBITDA and EBITDA service margins in the quarter  Revenues from the Wireline segment are likely to be  7 355 million  down from  7 617 million owing to competitive pressure from voice over Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple play  voice  data  and video  offerings by cable companies  In order to make Wireline profitable  Verizon is making significant investments and is streamlining its cost structure  These are likely to weigh on the company s margins Our proven model does not conclusively show that Verizon is likely to beat earnings in the fourth quarter as it does not possess the key components  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below

110805,332320,MSI,Motorola  MSI  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Motorola  NYSE MSI  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This communications equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 6  
Revenues are expected to be  2 22 billion  up 13 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Motorola 
For Motorola  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 73  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Motorola will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Motorola would post earnings of  1 72 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 94  delivering a surprise of  12 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Motorola appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/motorola-msi-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200382025,200382025

uncertainty triggered by trade related headwinds in the aftermath of U S  China row over Huawei  To add to the woes  there seemed to be no major headway in the recent bilateral talks between U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu  This even overshadowed the peak earnings season  wherein leading technology firms reported quarterly results  with overall performance being quite a dampener compared with the past few quarters The high level trade negotiations between the two nations took place on the U S  shores to end the trade war that is apparently on pause till Mar 1  The Chinese trade delegation led by Liu also had a meeting with President Trump  Although no significant breakthrough was made to ease the trade impasse  a White House statement revealed that China had agreed to purchase 5 million metric tons of U S  soybeans  The Trump administration views this as a major positive and a goodwill gesture to pave the path for future such trade concessions The next round of trade negotiations is slated to be held next week with a team of U S  delegates headed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin travelling to China  Specific discussions relating to restrictions for technology products were muted and the industry awaits further clarity on the cusp of 5G revolution  Meanwhile  the Trump administration continued to put pressure on China by seeking the extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou from Canada  Notably  Canada now has time till Mar 1 to assess the request     The government is also supposedly preparing an executive order that could give sweeping powers to the Commerce Department to review imported products by domestic firms and ban the outright sale of such equipment on grounds of national security interests  Industry

110832,332347,MSI,Why Motorola  MSI  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Motorola  NYSE MSI   which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this communications equipment maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 68   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Motorola was expected to post earnings of  1 72 per share  but it reported  1 94 per share instead  representing a surprise of 12 79   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 37 per share  while it actually produced  1 46 per share  a surprise of 6 57  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Motorola  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Motorola has an Earnings ESP of  1 73  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 7  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-motorola-msi-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200374074,200374074
110833,332348,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T To Shelve Data Sharing  Qualcomm s Defense   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks had a roller coaster ride as optimism over U S  China trade negotiations was negated by market uncertainty triggered by a prolonged partial shutdown of the government  and federal investigation of criminal charges against Huawei  The spiraling issue could further derail the bilateral trade talks between U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu scheduled later this month A flurry of decisive steps from China to ease some bottlenecks in the bilateral trade relations and resumption of trade negotiations seemed to offer respite to the beleaguered sector that bore the brunt of the bitter trade war  However  partial shutdown by various federal agencies  for an all time record of 26 days and counting  dented market euphoria as unavailability of funds by the FCC affected the speedy deployment of 5G technologies  The shutdown hampered FCC s equipment authorization process  compounding industry fears that the impasse could jeopardize the country s edge in the upcoming 5G boom To add to the woes  the U S  Justice Department has reportedly decided to pursue a criminal case against leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei for alleged trade secret theft  The latest indictment traces its roots to a civil suit filed by T Mobile US  Inc  in Seattle District Court in 2014  in which it accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets at the behest of R D team based in China  Although the case was settled with a  4 8 million compensation award to T Mobile in 2017  it seems that the Trump administration will leave no stone unturned to ban China s Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763  from the country  A bipartisan group of U S  lawmakers has already introduced bills in this regard Meanwhile  the tense undercurrents related to Huawei CFO  Meng Wanzhou and her probable extradition to the United States continued to haunt both the countries  It remains to be seen how the trial pans out with incriminating documents revealing the suspected ties of Huawei with two obscure companies  using which Meng allegedly deceived international banks into clearing transactions  worth millions of dollars  with Iran despite economic sanctions Regarding company specific news  strategic corporate actions  product

110860,332375,MSI,Motorola  MSI  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Motorola Solutions  NYSE MSI   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  133 83 in the previous session  Motorola Solutions has gained 48 1  since the start of the year compared to the 3 3  move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 9 6  return for the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on November 1  2018  Motorola reported EPS of  1 94 versus consensus estimate of  1 72 
For the current fiscal year  Motorola is expected to post earnings of  6 98 per share on  7 31 billion in revenues  This represents a 27 84  change in EPS on a 14 57  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 53 per share on  7 72 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 88  and 5 62   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Motorola may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Motorola has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 19 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 17 9X versus its peer group s average of 12 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 96  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank

111054,332569,MSI,Ericsson  ERIC  Focuses On Core Businesses  Risks Remain,opinion,On May 10  we issued an updated research report on telecom services provider  Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   Ericsson is pursuing three main areas  namely core business growth  targeted growth and cost   efficiency to maximize growth  In terms of  core business growth   it is focusing on deployment of 4G and fostering 5G  The company constantly seeks to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployments and prepare grounds for the forthcoming 5G revolution  Secondly  the company plans to focus more intently on software sales and recurring business that complements its thriving Professional Services business in terms of  targeted growth  investments  With such concerted efforts  Ericsson expects to be better equipped to address the varied needs of its customer segments and tap on market opportunities for faster growth To help it realize its goals  Ericsson has entered into collaboration with communications technology behemoth Cisco Systems  Inc   NASDAQ CSCO   inking a global business and technology partnership to create futuristic networks  The Ericsson Cisco duo extends routing  data center  networking  cloud  mobility  management and control  and global services capabilities to clients across the globe  It appears that this collaboration is shaping up well  with the companies jointly procuring more than 60 deals in IP  routing and transport  and services  At present  they enjoy 250 active customer engagements and remain optimistic that these will lead to award wins  going forward  Over the past three months  Ericsson has outperformed the  with an average return of 20 5  against a decline of 1 8  for the latter  Ericsson is focusing on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself for market leadership on 5G  The company believes that standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitization of industries as well as broadband  Moreover  Ericsson foresees mainstream 4G offerings giving way to 5G technology in the future  Meanwhile  the impending deployment of 5G networks in 2020 is expected to boost the adoption of IoT devices with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence  The Ericsson Mobility report suggests that almost 90  of smartphone subscriptions are on 3G and 4G networks today but they will be upgraded to 5G networks when it becomes commercially available in 2020  Ericsson has already introduced pre standard 5G networks  5G will accelerate the digital transformation in many industries  enabling new use cases in areas such as IoT  automation  transport and Big Data  The report also forecasts 550 million 5G subscriptions in 2022  with North America expected to lead the way  Such positive industry trends are expected to boost the company s long term growth However  Ericsson s business is prone to be impacted by the political and economical uncertainties in its operating countries  Particularly  uncertainty in the financial markets  reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats for Ericsson  The company s revenues and gross margins continue to take a beating from adverse industry trends  Persistent low investments in mobile broadband in certain markets and lower managed services sales have harmed sales of Networks segment while lower legacy product sales have hurt IT   Cloud revenues  Lower IPR licensing revenues and an unfavorable mix between coverage   capacity and services are adding to the company s concerns  Moreover  it has been facing investment headwinds in network developments in Mediterranean  Northern Europe and Central Asia  especially Russia  regions as well as in Latin America and the Middle East  In addition  the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Brexit referendum may prove to be a spoiler for Ericsson  stalling major investment decisions Soft mobile broadband demand and challenging macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets are acting as deterrents to major investments by telecom equipment behemoths  and this has significantly dented Ericsson s performance  These factors manifested in the company s poor sales  Overall  it expects the negative industry trends and business mix in mobile broadband to prevail this year as well  Europe and Latin America   the markets with the biggest impact   are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment  The China market will likely continue to contract due to declining LTE investments  even as North America enjoys a positive momentum  Further  spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the U S  telecom industry that has a saturated wireless market  The situation has worsened with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming  cloud computing and video conferencing services  In addition  the company s cash flow could be materially hurt by market and customer project adjustments  Though the company is working diligently to improve the situation  tangible results are yet to materialize Nevertheless  we remain impressed

China trade concerns abated  concerns over the implications of Senate s approval to retain net neutrality played spoilsport Last week  President Trump made a sudden turnabout by acknowledging in a Twitter post that he was working with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE  HK 0763   a way to get back into business  fast   after its operations crippled following a seven year ban on sale of various components for illegally shipping goods to Iran  Industry experts believed that the strategic move by one of the most vocal supporters of national security and job protectionism was

of proposed tariffs on American agricultural exports and free access to the Chinese markets As concerns across the global borders subsided  domestic issues came to the forefront when the U S  Senate

The company has been gaining a lot of traction in emerging markets  Accretive acquisitions have expanded company s product portfolio into higher growth segments  such as Cloud computing and Big Data  Further  expanding footprint in the rapidly growing blockchain market is a positive  Estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company s Q1 earnings release  
Nevertheless  IBM is having a tough time  given the ongoing and heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud  Modest IT spending growth along with foreign exchange volatility is a concern  Intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Enbridge have declined  24 5  over the last year  underperforming the Zacks Oil Pipeline industry s loss of  17 5  during the same period  Enbridge has the longest and most sophisticated crude and liquids pipeline system in the world that spreads over 17 511 miles  
The Zacks analyst likes the merger with Spectra Energy  F SEP  as it has made Enbridge the largest energy infrastructure company in North America in terms of enterprise value  The company s huge backlog of growth projects that stands at roughly C 22 billion along with the C 12 billion worth midstream projects that are online will help it drive dividends by 10  annually through 2020  
However  the company s substantial debt load is a matter of concern  During 2017  long term debt rose more than 70  while cash balance declined almost 73   reflecting weak financials 
 You can   
Buy ranked ADP s shares have gained  14 2  over the last year  underperforming the Zacks Outsourcing industry  which has gained  18 2  over the same period  ADP has been focused on streamlining its business to strengthen core operations in the long run  To this end  the company has divested a number of its divisions in the past few years  
Further  the Zacks analyst stresses that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and HCM market  primarily due to its robust product portfolio  Acquisitions have also been a key growth catalyst for ADP  The company s strong balance sheet enables it to continue with its shareholder friendly activities alongside strategic buyouts and investments on product development  
However  investments in new initiatives may continue to weigh on its bottom line results  Moreover  rising unemployment levels will negatively impact the company  Increasing competition is another major headwind

111078,332593,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Will U S  Restrictions On Chinese Firms Boomerang ,opinion,Over the last five trading days  telecom stocks were initially slow off the blocks but gradually picked up pace  as protective measures by the U S  government seemed to propel the industry to gain an upper hand over its Chinese counterparts At a meeting held last week  the Federal Communications Commission   FCC   came up with a concrete date to auction licenses of high band spectrum so that wireless networks could roll out 5G technology by the end of the year  The FCC voted unanimously to auction off licenses for the 28GHz spectrum on Nov 14  followed by another round for 24GHz spectrum soon after  The FCC expects to sell about 6 000 individual licenses for different chunks of spectrum in different geographic locations The FCC also voted unanimously to finalize a plan this year to prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to the U S  national security  The decision takes a swipe at Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE and intensifies the murky trade war between the two superpowers  The strategic plan aims to thwart the U S  companies to utilize the  8 5 billion FCC Universal Service Fund to procure goods or services from Chinese firms  limiting the latter s ability to sell their products in the country

111108,332623,MSI,Weighing The Week Ahead  Will The U S  Launch A Trade War ,opinion,"The economic calendar is normal but featuring the monthly employment report  Usually that would be the focus  and it might become so by week s end  Until the situation is clarified  the paramount question will be 
Has the US ignited a trade war 
Last Week Recap
My  two weeks ago  asked whether the coast was clear  Good question  and I guess we got the answer  Last week s  post pointed to a discussion of an infrastructure bill  In the wake of other events that got no attention at all 
I did cite an escalation of trade rhetoric as among my worries  but it went from worry to major impact much faster than anyone expected  It took only a few minutes 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  The Investing com version of the S P futures shows the action while the stock market is closed  The interactive version also lets you specify your choice of both time and intervals  Finally  there is a tag for significant news at various key points 

The decline this week included a 5  trading range  continuing the recent record of higher volatility  I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in the Indicator Snapshot 
Personal Note
Spring vacation is coming  even though Spring has not yet arrived  I will be off the week after next  including the weekend before and afterward  I will try to post an indicator update  especially if there are important changes 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news was mixed  Once again  the market reaction had little to do with the news flow 
The Good
Consumer confidence registered the highest reading since 2000 and the Michigan index is more than 16  above the long term average   has excellent updates on both  Her chart of the Conference Board measure is an example of what you will see in her post 

Personal income increased 0 4   beating most expectations of 0 3    takes his typical deep dive into the report  showing each of the elements as well as historical context 
Corporate earnings recorded a great quarter and estimates continue to rise   compares this to the usual estimate declines at this point of the quarter   has repeatedly noted this same trend  The forward earnings skeptics should pay attention 

Initial jobless claims continue the amazing improvement   calls it  ludicrous mode  

ISM index shows the strong start to 2018     



The Bad
Housing data
New home sales declined to an annual rate of 593K and a decrease of 1  year over year   suggests that we be cautious until we have February and March data  This may help determine whether tax law changes are part of the cause 
Pending home sales declined 4 7  for the month and 3 8  year over year     

Durable goods orders declined 3 7   worse than the 2 0  expected 
Auto sales declined 2 4  in February  A combination of reduced incentives  and therefore higher prices   higher interest rates  and tougher credit conditions led to a tough sales market       tracks the F150 sales which remained strong  Some treat this as a reflection of small business and construction demand  Perhaps reduced auto sales will not spill into the general economy 

Powell testimony spooked the market  which saw indications of a more hawkish Fed  The market has consistently been less bullish on the economy than the Fed  expecting a slow pace of rate increases   that the futures market moved the chance of a fourth hike this year to 33 5   He is skeptical    our go to expert on the Fed  focused more on the precise language  particularly the concern about an overheated economy 

My focus fell on this in the written testimony 


In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years  the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis 


This is a crucial sentence that marks a change in focus  Compare this with the previous version of this testimony  delivered by former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in July of last year 


The Committee continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain maximum employment and stable prices  

In a follow up post   the increased concern with inflationary pressures 
 Jeff  The Fed has typically waited too long to hike rates and been unable to stop incipient inflation  Financial markets can handle a gradual increase in rates  Transparency about Fed intentions and criteria is helpful 

The steel and aluminum tariff announcement was a surprise to most  including those in the Administration  The swift reaction showed that this is a market unfriendly step  although it was a temporary positive for a handful of steel stocks 

The Ugly
Nuclear escalation    designed to avoid US defense systems  Some suggest that this is linked to recently proposed US weapons modernization and expansion  Others see it as political posturing 

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a normal economic calendar with an emphasis on employment   The survey week for the BLS reports ended only two weeks ago  Occasionally the calendar pushes this report to the second Friday of the month   ISM Services is also of some interest 
Like it or not  the Washington circus may well dominate the news   once again 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
The economic calendar is normal but features the report markets find most interesting   the employment situation  That topic may be of great interest by week s end  but only if there is clarification on the tariff proposals  I expect many to be asking 
 Has the US launched a trade war 
To explore the key question  I will do my typical list of alternatives followed by my own analysis  But first  I want to emphasize an important distinction  the difference between policy analysis and politics 
I often emphasize that people should separate their investment decisions from their political viewpoints  Deciding to sell all your stocks because you do not like an election result is a costly investment mistake  It is important to understand current public policy whether you agree with it or not  President George W  Bush s tax cuts  President Obama s Affordable Care Act  and President Trump s tax policy changes are all good examples  You should not judge policy based upon whether you agree with the decision  Those who objected to the distributive effects of GOP tax cuts could do so as citizens but should not have ignored the economic effects  Whether or not they liked Obamacare  astute investors joined me in buying health insurance stocks 
That is what it means to separate investing and politics  In the last year  this distinction has become more difficult to make  Merely mentioning the name of the President seems to bring an end to careful analysis  That is not effective  Making good investments does not mean you must ignore hot button issues  Estimating the chances for increased gun control  for example  is a subject for objective analysis  If your analysis is accurate  you may find some stocks to buy or to sell  Your personal policy preference is irrelevant to your investment decision 
This type of analysis can help us with the trade war issue  Here are the things that might happen  As usual  someone is making an argument for each possibility 
The tariff announcement was just the start  Get ready for all out war  which the President views as  good and easy to win     
Expect a withdrawal from NAFTA to be next 
Even without action on NAFTA  this will have a  on the current negotiations 
Expect affected countries to retaliate against the US    
The Administration may walk this back  at least partially  in the face of widespread discontent among key constituencies 
A reason may be found to treat this as a warning   a negotiating ploy 
A change of policy may be softened with some other kind of help for steel companies 
As usual  I ll suggest my own interpretations in today s Final Thought

Insight for Investors
Investors should have a long term horizon  They can often exploit trading volatility  I remind investors of this each week  but now is the time to pay attention 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would naturally be   You should take the time to read the whole thing  but I want to highlight a key point 

Investing is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption at a later date   Risk  is the possibility that this objective won t be attained 


By that standard  purportedly  risk free  long term bonds in 2012 were a far riskier investment than a long term investment in common stocks  At that time  even a 1  annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 would have decreased the purchasing power of the government bond that Prot g  and I sold 


I want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day  week or even year  stocks will be riskier   far riskier   than short term U S  bonds  As an investor s investment horizon lengthens  however  a diversified portfolio of U S  equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds  assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then prevailing interest rates 


It is a terrible mistake for investors with long term horizons   among them  pension funds  college endowments and savings minded individuals   to measure their investment  risk  by their portfolio s ratio of bonds to stocks  Often  high grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk 


Stock Ideas
Housing stocks have room to run    

Given strong demand  insufficient inventory  and modest annual price gains  many industry experts see the recovery continuing for several years unless mortgage rates unexpectedly spike  spoiling what has been a tame but enjoyable party 


 You have a lot of buyers chasing very few houses   says John Kendig  a long time associate broker in the Richmond  Va   area  He says his clients recently missed out on an 1 800 square foot brick colonial near the city even though the couple offered about  25 000 over the list price of  425 000 


 Housing is in the third or fourth inning of a nine inning game   says Bill Smead  lead portfolio manager of the  1 3 billion Smead Value fund  which holds shares of two home builders    ticker  NYSE LEN  and   NVR   in a 28 stock portfolio   This is a normally cyclical business in a secular growth trend  

 Jeff  These are exactly the factors I have been citing for more than a year  Many housing reporters complain if prices are too high  unaffordable  or too low  bad market   They complain if there is too much inventory or too little  If interest rates go too low  potential buyers are just waiting  If they move higher  the buyers are suddenly priced out  I continue to like the sector

111111,332626,MSI,Motorola  MSI  Hits Fresh Highs  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Motorola Solutions  Inc   NYSE MSI    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6 05  over the past month  MSI hit a new 52 week high of  109 18 in the previous session  Motorola Solutions has gained 20 48  since the start of the year compared to the 6 78  move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 4 44  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 1  2018  Motorola Solutions reported EPS of  2 1 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 56  
For the current fiscal year  Motorola Solutions is expected to post earnings of  6 57 per share on  6 78 billion in revenues  This represents a 20 33  change in EPS on a 6 26  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  7 01 per share on  7 05 billion in revenues  This represents changes of 6 6  and 3 93   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Motorola Solutions may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for MSI  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Motorola Solutions has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 16 56x current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 14 82x versus its peer group s average of 13 29x  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 07  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Motorola Solutions  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank

111141,332656,MSI,Ubiquiti  UBNT  Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates  Revenues Up Y Y,opinion,Ubiquiti Networks  Inc  s   NASDAQ UBNT   second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings fell short of estimates  putting an end to the three quarter earnings beat streak  The company s adjusted earnings came in at 76 cents  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents by 6 2   Shares fell about 14 1  in the trading session following the results  indicating that investors were disappointed with the earnings miss However  the figure was up 5 6  compared with year ago quarterly figure of 72 cents  The year over year improvement can primarily be attributable to impressive top line growth during the quarter  Inside the HeadlinesUbiquiti reported record revenues of  250 8 million  which crossed the higher end of the company s projected range of  240  250 million  Further  it grew 17 2  on a year over year basis  and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  220 million comfortably  Steady demand in all product lines across end markets proved conducive to top line growth Ubiquiti Networks  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The company s Enterprise Technology segment continued to fare remarkably well  with revenues surging a whopping 33 7  year over year to  131 million  Continued adoption of the company s UniFi AC technology platform fueled striking growth The Service Provider Technology segment also achieved growth of 3 7  year over year  generating  119 9 million In terms of geography  revenues in Asia Pacific remained steady  rising 48 6  year over year  EMEA regions

the company provided guidance for third quarter fiscal 2018  Management projects revenues for the fiscal third quarter in the range of  245 260 million  while non GAAP earnings are expected within 92 99 cents per share To ConcludeThough the end of the earnings beat streak may not go well with investors  the solid year over year revenue growth of Ubiquiti is a major positive  Going forward  the company believes traction of the recently launched products to drive top line growth However  in recent times  the company is experiencing adverse macroeconomic issues like currency risks  rising labor costs in key locations and natural disasters  which pose concerns  The extremely competitive environment  which includes big multinational wireless telecom players  service providers as well as

111142,332657,MSI,Can iRobot stand up to competition ,opinion,"Vacuum cleaner company iRobot Corporation  NASDAQ IRBT  has had a tumultuous month and now has been hit hard by its latest earnings report  As the  and other sources report  iRobot saw its stock value fall by 20 percent in after hours trading on Wednesday  and it has continued to decrease in value in trading on Thursday morning 
iRobot s fall is occurring despite the fact that the report announces fourth quarter revenue rose by 54 percent and operating income rose to  23 1 million compared to  18 7 million in the same quarter in 2016  The fall came because  despite these solid numbers  iRobot slashed its expectations for the year as  it said it was looking for earnings per share of  2 10  2 35 for fiscal year 2018  compared to analyst expectations of  2 70 
This forecast is disappointing  and it has appeared to spark fears of iRobot s ability to remain the top robot vacuum cleaner  RVC  developer in the face of continual battles to protect its intellectual property as well as rising competition from other developers like SharkNinja  But the fact is that iRobot is the market leader in a field for which there will continue to be high and growing demand  A 20 percent fall in value is a total overreaction  and smart investors should take advantage before its value jumps up again 
The Power of Roomba While iRobot s earnings expectations may not be in line with investor hopes  its revenue expectations are bigger and with good reason  iRobot stated in a report  that despite the growing popularity of robotic vacuum cleaners  they still only make up 21 percent of the global vacuum cleaner market above  200 compared to 13 percent in 2012  RVCs will continue to grow in popularity as society embraces automation in every corner of our lives  and iRobot has a dominant market share with RVCs  That in and of itself should make iRobot an attractive investment after this recent collapse in value 
Furthermore  iRobot has plenty of other avenues to expand beyond vacuum cleaners  It has released robotic pool cleaners and mops already  and is looking into other household appliances such as lawnmowers  Analysts have been talking about the Internet of Things and the smart home for years  with  stating that the smart home market will jump from  18 billion in 2018 to  32 billion by 2022  As a leader in one category of smart home devices  iRobot is in a prime position to take advantage of this future growth 
Dealing with Competitors iRobot may dominate the RVC market for now  but skeptics have argued that it will decline in the face of increasing competition  This is not an unreasonable fear  The company has been embroiled in numerous lawsuits attempting to protect its intellectual property  It sued three Chinese companies  for intellectual property infringement  as well as lawsuits against  MSI  Hoover  Bissell  and other vacuum cleaners  The lawsuits against the Chinese companies are particularly critical given that iRobot is betting a great deal of its future growth on success in China as well as the constant problem of Chinese property infringements  If iRobot is driven out of China then skeptics would be perfectly justified in their fears 
But that is a future concern  compared to the more immediate problem of SharkNinja  SharkNinja is no overmatched startup  It has successfully competed against Dyson and is selling a good RVC at a lower price point than iRobot  When SharkNinja launched their products  iRobot s value fell more than 15 percent  Other big names like Samsung  KS 005930  and LGear are also hanging around and could enter the RVC market as well 
But iRobot has a dominant lead  has a major advantage in name brand  and competition does not need to be destructive given how much the RVC market will continue to expand  And while its lawsuits against potential competitors take time and money  iRobot ultimately prevailed in court last year against MSI and Black   Decker  Both companies agreed to leave the RVC market for some time  That iRobot s revenue has continued to grow massively also indicates that competition is not an immediate threat 
Growth and Opportunity Concerns of competition and missed expectations aside  the fact is that iRobot is a profitable  growing market leader in a market which will continue to grow and which just saw its value take a significant hit as investors overreacted  It is hard to sum up a  buy low  opportunity better than this 
iRobot is not just a vacuum cleaner company  It is looking to take full advantage of the Internet of Things and automation to help create the smart home of the future  and thus holds massive potential  Even if it is slashing its growth estimates  this company has a history of underpromising and overdelivering  Investors would do well to remember that and take advantage of the current rut ",2018-02-08,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-irobot-stand-up-to-competition-200288719,200288719
111143,332658,MSI,ViaSat  VSAT  Posts Q3 Loss Ahead Of ViaSat 2 Service Launch,opinion,ViaSat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   reported third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted loss of 4 cents per share  down drastically from earnings of 29 cents recorded in the year ago quarter  With only a marginal gain in quarterly revenues  ViaSat s earnings plummeted as the company ramped up expenses ahead of offering subscribers service with its new high speed satellite Further  the company recorded an additional income tax expense of approximately  12 million in relation to the recent tax reforms On a GAAP basis  the company swung to a net loss of 42 cents per share  in stark contrast to earnings of 8 cents recorded in the year ago period Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of  381 8 million in the fiscal third quarter  which marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  388 6 million  Revenues inched up 0 3  compared to the prior year quarter tally  Strong growth in government business drove top line performance  which was offset by contraction in Satellite Services revenues  Revenue growth was strained owing to the capacity constraints that the company is facing ahead of the ViaSat 2 commercial service launch New contract awards  up 23 2  to  436 million  rose sharply in the quarter Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues continued the downward trend and slipped sharply  down 9 7  year over year  to  144 5 million  due to a modest downtick in residential subscriber count  The decline was also attributable to the prior year benefit of  6 8 million connected to proceeds under the Loral settlement  Notably  Average Revenue per User  ARPU  in ViaSat s residential broadband Internet business grew 8  year over yearto a new record high of  68 23 Commercial Networks  performance turned around this quarter  as its revenues inched up 1 9  on a year over year basis to  55 5 million  driven byhigher airborne terminal sales On the other hand  Government Systems continued the impressive growth trajectory and reported solid revenues of  181 8 million  up 9 5  year over year  driven by growth across the broad product service portfolio  Impressive growth in revenues drove solid operating profit  up 23  year over year  and Adjusted EBITDA  up 19 7  year over year  for the reported quarter During the quarter  sales backlog grew 6 3  year over year to  1 128 7 million  led by record contribution from the Government Systems segment Adjusted EBITDA plunged 33  from the comparable quarter last year to  56 2 million  hurt by elevated start up costs associated with the ViaSat 2 service launch  higher R D outlay and costs related to planned large scale service ramp up in commercial air  Also  completion of the Loral settlement affected the company s EBITDA  Nevertheless  sequentially  R D levels declined  6 million  as ViaSat begins transitioning to the ViaSat 3 payload construction phase ViaSat  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Other HighlightsThe company s ViaSat 2 satellite is ready for service and will likely be launched next week  with national coverage scheduled for February end  ViaSat 2  touted to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1  Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat 1 include high capacity connectivity  smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways  ViaSat believes these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points  delivering greater network reliability and security Further  the ViaSat 3 payload program has begun its transition to the construction phase Concurrent with the earnings release  the company announced signing a new direct contract with the United Airlines for more than 70 additional aircraft  including the new 737MAX fleet In the fiscal third quarter  ViaSat entered production service with Qantas in Australia using its second generation platform  The company inked contracts for 92 additional aircrafts from existing airline customers during the quarter  bringing its tally for total in service and under contract airplanes to nearly 1 600 LiquidityViaSat exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  161 8 million compared with  130 1 million as of Mar 31  2017  The company also generated strong operating cash flow in the fiscal year to date  which hit  283 million  despite the ramp up of expenses and capacity constraints To ConcludeThe company is about to roll out ViaSat 2 commercial services and is also beginning to transition to lower payload R D expenses on the ViaSat 3 program  Both these factors will support profitability and capital flow improvement ViaSat 2 projects segment revenues to resume growth this year  even as ramp up expenses beginning to moderate as a percentage of sales  Nonetheless  the company predicts much heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters  which will again raise costs and hurt margins  Further  the fiscal fourth quarter is expected to see higher commission expenses related to increased subscriber additions Strong backlog levels  robust prospects of core government business and significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential  in flight  and government markets are likely to accelerate the company s growth momentum in the near term Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderWe have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on ViaSat currently  Some better ranked stocks in the same space include iRobot Corporation

111147,332662,MSI,Viasat Rolls Out New Internet Service Powered By ViaSat 2,opinion,"Viasat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   rolled out the fastest satellite internet available in the United States  powered by the new ViaSat 2 satellite system  The company is offering streaming and download speeds of up to 100 Mbps to subscribers along with unlimited data plans for video streaming 
The service is aimed at households that are outside the reach of cable systems  10 30 million households in the United States   These consumers have limited options for high speed Internet service  with DSL being the most common choice  However  DSL speeds typically top out at 25 megabits per second 
In essence  Viasat is offering its service as a higher speed alternative to DSL  Viasat s new plans start at 12 megabits per second  at an initial cost of  50 per month  Consumers can scale up to 25 megabits for  70 per month  50 megabits for  100 per month and 100 megabits for  150 a month  Each of the plans offer unlimited data  which allows roughly 150 gigabits of video streaming and other consumption per month 
If a user exceeds the data limits and the network is crowded  they may experience slower speeds  However  Viasat insisted that it will not charge overage fees 
The new plans are powered by ViaSat 2  a  625 million high capacity satellite launched by the company in June 2017  The satellite also powers fast in flight Wi Fi for JetBlue  American Airlines  United Airlines and other commercial carriers and government customers  ViaSat 2 satellite system provides service to North America  Central America  the Caribbean and a small part of northern South America 
ViaSat 2 is expected to have twice the bandwidth and seven times more broadband coverage  and is a massive improvement over ViaSat 1  Some other features which make it more powerful than ViaSat 1 include high capacity connectivity  smaller gateway antenna and twice as many gateways  Viasat believes that these advanced smaller gateways can help it place the latest satellites in proximity of popular Internet access points  delivering greater network reliability and security 
Viasat is already building its next generation high capacity satellite system   ViaSat 3   which is expected to expand its network worldwide 
The satellite business is a burgeoning space and is one of the fastest growing segments of the  350 billion space industry  Significant demand for higher speeds of broadband connectivity in residential  in flight and government markets are likely to accelerate Viasat s growth momentum in the near term 
In recent quarters  Viasat s earnings have suffered due to R D expenses  The primary dampeners are the ViaSat 3 payload  pre flight development and testing  commercial in flight connectivity  STCs and line fit activity  This indicates that we can expect more pressure on profits in the upcoming quarters  Viasat s shares have gained just 4  in the past year  underperforming the  s gain of 18 2  

Revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter was strained due to capacity constraints  Also  the costs related to the ViaSat 2 service launch activities and preparations for the large scale in flight Wi Fi ramp are expected to burden the bottom line in the coming quarters  The company also predicts heavier advertising activity over the next several quarters  which will raise costs and hurt margins 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Viasat carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
A few better ranked stocks in the same space include HP Inc    NYSE HPQ    Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI   and Harris Corp    NYSE HRS    each holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

With four back to back earnings beats  Harris Corp  has a striking average positive surprise of 6 7

111178,332693,MSI,The Good News Alongside Motorola s Stock Sale,opinion,"One part of the bear case for Shotspotter Inc  NASDAQ SSTI  is that insiders are eager to dump their positions  and their selling will crush the stock  It turned out that   When it came time for a significant holder to sell  SSTI sailed through the event just fine 
 on Wednesday  January 10  The sale caused a volume surge that at first glance looked like a washout of the last motivated sellers  An alert by the Canton ShotSpotter system resulted in the arrest of three men and the recovery of more than  5 000 of counterfeit money and multiple firearms  Total trading volume hit 1 4M shares  far surpassing any other trading day except for SSTI s first day of trading  Buyers followed through by sending SSTI as high as 7  the next day 

ShotSpotter  SSTI  is on the comeback trail with a strong breakout above its 50 day moving average  DMA 
Source  
The strong buying in response to the large sale is the good news from this trading action  From a technical standpoint  SSTI looks like it convincingly confirmed a breakout above its 50 day moving average  DMA   The next test will be the all time high that followed the last earnings report and preceded the bear raid 
There is also recent good news from the implementation side  I found some encouraging stories from the good folks posting on SSTI on StockTwits that add yet more confirmation of the value of ShotSpotter s system for detecting gunfire 
Canton  OH On the same day Motorola sold shares  News 5 Cleveland reported on a successful ShotSpotter implementation in Canton  OH  ShotSpotter was credited for an alert to police that generated  the arrest of three men and the recovery of more than  5 000 of counterfeit money and multiple firearms   ShotSpotter was police s FIRST alert to the incident and the responders were given information on the closest address on their way to the scene  A policeman interviewed for the story noted the value of having ShotSpotter s ears on the scene when police cannot be present 
Stories like these are important as they continue to build the case for more and more cities to implement ShotSpotter systems as a part of crime fighting efforts 
Back in September  the Sacramento city council approved funding for a ShotSpotter system in the Oak Park area after seeing the success the system had in the Del Paso Heights and Meadowview areas of the city  A Sacramento police officer was quoted some of the benefits 

  It s a very accurate activation Not only the location but the caliber of the gun  and it provides these officers with a lot more knowledge when they re responding to a potentially violent situation   

From June 15  2015 to May 31  2017  ShotSpotter is credited with contributing to a series of success metrics including 89 arrests and 90 guns removed from the streets  Sacramento County also wants to allocate  1 1M to its own ShotSpotter system 
The momentum is building for ShotSpotter  and I am looking forward to hearing yet more success stories 
Be careful out there

111202,332717,MSI,Is Motorola Solutions  MSI  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Motorola Solutions has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 6  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Motorola Solutions  current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 19 5  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Motorola Solutions has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Motorola Solutions  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Motorola Solutions has a P S ratio of about 2 5  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Motorola Solutions currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MSI a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Motorola Solutions might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives MSI a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and two lower  while the full year estimate has seen five upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen about 2 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Motorola Solutions  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineMotorola Solutions is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  bottom 36  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to

111248,332763,MSI,Verizon Communications Plans Cost Cuts To Fund Dividends,opinion,"U S telecom behemoth  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   is planning to cut costs by up to  10 billion over the next four years  In fact  the company wants to fund its dividend with this savings as stated by the company s  at a Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  conference 
On Sep 7  Verizon announced a quarterly dividend of 59 cents per share that witnessed an increase of 1 25 cents per share  or 2 2    from the last quarter  Notably  this is the 11th successive year that the board has approved a raise 
However  funding of dividends is difficult with rising debts  At the end of the second quarter of 2017  Verizon had  117 54 billion in long term debts compared with  108 08 billion in the year earlier period  The debt to capitalization ratio was 0 81 at the end of the quarter  in line with the 2016 end figure  Verizon has a dividend yield of 4 9   whereas its top peer AT T Inc   NYSE T  has a dividend yield of 5 4  
Consequently  the company plans to slash  10 billion of its costs and support the dividend payout with the savings by 2022 
In the first half of 2017  Verizon has made  4 7 billion in cash dividend payments and has 4 1 billion shares of common stock outstanding approximately

In fact  Verizon is considering mobile hotspot and home based fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the United States in 2018 
Also  the company has integrated Versa Networks to its software defined networking solutions  Its primary motive is the expansion of managed services to a broader segment of small and medium businesses in response to rising demand for virtualized services 
Furthermore  Verizon s acquisition of the core businesses of the Internet company  Yahoo  Inc  NASDAQ AABA    perfectly complements Verizon s focus areas of digital platform  Hence  the closure of this deal paves the way for a new beginning 
Markedly  Oath is a part of Verizon s Media and Telematics organization and is overseeing a diverse house of more than 50 media and technology brands under Yahoo and AOL  thus engaging more than a billion people globally  AOL Inc  is a major player in the digital content and online advertising space  acquired by Verizon in June 2015

111312,332827,MSI,Sprint  S  To Provide 6 Gbps Data Speed Over LTE Network,opinion,"U S  national wireless carrier  Sprint Corporation   NYSE S   has decided to offer 6 Gbps gigabit data transmission speed over LTE network in major markets 
Sprint and Samsung  KS 005930  reported that in a recent test conducted in South Korea  they achieved peak speeds of 330 Mbps per channel using a 20 MHz channel  The test represented the real world application of the new technology on 2 5 GHz spectrum 
Wireless network standards are continuously evolving around the globe to offer faster speed  Following significant deployment of 4G LTE networks  LTE A  Long Term Evolution Advanced  wireless networks are gradually finding a solid foothold globally  LTE A is a more powerful version of the legacy LTE network  offering increased speed and network capacity  Carriers around the world are upgrading their 4G LTE networks to 4G LTE Advanced Pro  which is capable of delivering Gigabit class LTE speeds 
Sprint started the deployment of Gigabit LTE on a commercial network in New Orleans in March  this year  utilizing three channel carrier aggregation  60MHz of Sprint s 2 5 GHz spectrum  4X4 MIMO and 256 QAM modulation  Qualcomm Inc s   NASDAQ QCOM   Snapdragon 835 is currently the only smartphone processor with this capability and is found in devices like Samsung s newly announced Galaxy S8 and S8  as well as the unannounced upcoming Motorola  NYSE MSI  device 
4G LTE Advanced Pro and Gigabit LTE are a major step toward the smooth transition from 4G to the upcoming 5G network standard  Wireless giant  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ    which was the first company to deploy the 4G LTE  Long Term Evolution  network nationwide  is initially testing equipment at 15GHz  28GHz  39GHz and 64GHz frequency bands for 5G network deployment 
The U S  telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of competitors  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products  As the U S  boasts a high rate  95   of wireless penetration  competition in this space is intense with participants like Verizon Communications  AT T Inc    NYSE T    T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T    This  in turn  may pressurize the top and bottom lines of carriers vying for market share

111330,332845,MSI,The Seemingly Unstoppable Bitcoin,opinion,"Seven years ago  a single bitcoin was worth a quarter of a cent  But over the course of those seven years  its value has multiplied  This week  for the first time ever  bitcoin surged past  2 000  Namely  on Sunday night or Monday morning  the cryptocurrency topped  2 000   2 100  and  2 200  Reportedly it is now topping at  2600  It is now trading up by  184 36  or 9 1   at  2 208 94 a coin  In two days the value of this currency increased by more than   100  and since the beginning of the year  its price has risen 81 percent  In the past week alone  the price of bitcoin has gone up for 12   Monday also marked the seventh anniversary of the first recorded instance of bitcoin used in a real world transaction 
Earlier this year  the value of a single bitcoin was around   1 000  but since then it slowly started growing  Bitcoin first broke the  1 000 mark in 2013  but it was soon followed by a drop in value due to a combination of factors  Since 2010  bitcoin has been the top performing currency  except for 2014  as already mentioned  At the end of last year  the new regulation in China returned bitcoin to the  1 000 mark again  Since then it has continued to grow in worth  Now  the world s most popular cryptocurrency is worth over  2 000 per coin  and the total number of coins in circulation is  32 92 billion 
The political uncertainty and increased interest in Asia have helped elevate the level of interest in bitcoin  The  legalization  of the bitcoin in Japan  and the rising demand in China due to the weakness of the local currency  also helped the bitcoin climb to a higher value  The unpredictable currency market prompted people to buy bitcoins  and since April  its value seems unstoppable  Some investors see bitcoin as sort of a safe haven asset in the middle of this geopolitical turbulence in both Europe and the United States  Despite everything  the debate on the future of bitcoin continues  For example  even though Japan legalized the bitcoin stock exchange  Russia still remains one of its strongest opponents  In the United States  people hope that bitcoin will get a second chance 
Bitcoin isn t the only cryptocurrency on the rise  In under a month  ripple surged more than 1000   and became the second most valuable cryptocurrency in circulation  just behind bitcoin  Similarly  ethereum has seen its net worth more than double over the last month  trading  130 per coin with a total market cap of around  12B  These increases also mean that bitcoin no longer makes up for the majority of the cryptocurrencies market cap  Until a few months ago  the total market cap of bitcoin consistently hovered around 80   and today represents only 47  of total cryptocurrencies 
At the beginning of March  for the first time in history  bitcoin exceeded the value of gold  Experts predict that by 2020  the circulation digital money in Japan will reach up to nine billion dollars  This shows that in the future  the bitcoin will have an increasingly important role in financial transactions  In the next 10 years as the world becomes more connected through smartphones  the percentage of noncash transactions will rise from 15  to 30   By 2020  it is expected the total number of smartphone users to increase by 1 billion  This way nearly everyone could have a bank in their pocket  which will give bitcoin an additional boost  It also means that bitcoin could account for 50  of all noncash transactions 
Since its inception in 2009 and all the way up to today  bitcoin has had its ups and downs  Although it is officially  created  by Satoshi Nakamoto  the public believes that behind this pseudonym hide some of the world s most powerful companies like  Toshiba Corp   T 6502     Samsung  KS 005930     Nakamichi Corporation Bhd  KL NAKM   and  Motorola  NYSE MSI    Nevertheless  bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular ",2017-05-25,Brent Carrier,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-seemingly-unstoppable-bitcoin-200191325,200191325
111350,332865,MSI,Is Motorola A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Motorola has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 64  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 30  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Motorola s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Wireless Equipment industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 50  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Motorola has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 15  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Motorola stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Motorola has a P S ratio of about 2 36  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 08 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Motorola currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes MSI a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio comes in at 8 76  which is better than the industry average of 9 82  Clearly  MSI is a solid choice on the value front What About the Stock Overall Though Motorola might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives MSI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate move higher in the past 30 days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revision in the same time period Consequently  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has moved higher by 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Motorola Solutions  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineMotorola is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  Top 25  out of over 250 industries  and a good Zacks Rank instill investor confidence However  over the past one year  the Zacks categorized Wireless Equipment industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the bullish analyst revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Motorola Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best recommendations and most in depth

111357,332872,MSI,5 Low Beta Stocks To Buy For A Capricious October Market,opinion,The economy is dependent on various micro and macro factors  which can push the volatility button hard when they come into play  Notably  September saw a burning event like the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the U S  Presidential election 2016  which along with the sudden surge in oil prices and uncertainty looming over the Fed s rate hike decision caused various ups and downs in the market  The impact is most likely to slip into October  thus making it an unpredictable month Delving deeper into these factors  let s start with the face off between the two candidates for the White House that occurred last week  as it seems to be the talking point now  In fact  the first debate itself was signal enough for investors to judge the state of the economy under either s presidency  as the debate was quite a heated one   including discussions about various sectors  alongside some sensitive topics Well  elections always lead to stock market volatility and it won t be any different this time around   So  standing in the last month before the elections  investors must gear up for an extremely volatile October Further  the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  recent decision of curtailing the oil output caused a rebound in oil prices that had a mixed effect on the global economy  While the energy sector received it as good news  the surge in oil price was a threat to Consumer Goods and Airline spaces  This in turn  contributed significantly to the market commotion If these factors were not enough to keep investors on their toes as they embrace October  it should be kept in mind that this month will also mark the onset of the third quarter earnings season  thus adding to the market speculations  So when the stock market barely needs a spark to catch the fire of volatility  wonder what so many factors can do to it Safeguard Your PortfolioTo prevent themselves from a capricious October  investors must play safe by going for low beta stocks  Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  So  investors should go with low beta stocks  which are inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in  In this case  a low beta ranges from 0 to 1 We have selected five low beta stocks  beta less than 0 75  that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   The search was also narrowed down with a Value score of  A  or  B  Value stocks offer an opportunity to buy a stock that is currently undervalued by the market  We think investing in these stocks could actually be a safer bet  given their inclination for steady growth and momentum in price  Moreover  these stocks have low P Es  pay decent dividends  hold a solid outlook  usually yield high returns and produce exponential gains over time Let s Get GoingAll said  we zeroed in on the following five picks  using our  system Starting with the Pennsylvania based American Eagle Outfitters  Inc    NYSE AEO    this Zacks Rank  1 stock has a beta of 0 72  Also  the company has witnessed an uptrend in estimates for fiscal 2016  over the last 60 days  Adding further to its inherent strength story  the company has posted positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters now  and currently possesses a Value score of  A   So  we believe there s nothing that can keep you away from this leading specialty retailer of fashionable apparel and accessories  with a long term EPS growth rate of 11 8  Investors can also count on broad line closeout retailer   Big Lots Inc    NYSE BIG   with a beta as low as 0 66 and long term growth rate of 13 4   The company not only flaunts an impressive earnings surprise history in the past 10 straight quarters  but its positive estimate revisions for fiscal 2016 over the past two months also instill confidence among investors  This Ohio based company can be a perfect fit for investors  portfolio  armed with a value score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see To satiate investors  appetite further  we suggest investing in The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE   with a long term growth rate of 14 2   Headquartered in California  this Zacks Rank  2 company operates upscale  casual  and full service dining restaurants  The company s solid earnings surprise history and favorable estimate revisions for 2016 over the past 90 days  highlight its solid prospects  Not enough  Take a look at its value score of  A  and beta of 0 45  and you will be sure of tasting this delicious cheesecake Another stock you must not miss out on is Waste Management  Inc    NYSE WM    This provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America carries a Zacks Rank  2 and a value score of  B   The stock has not been a disappointment  as is evident from its average trailing four quarter earnings surprise of 4 2   with a beat in each quarter  Further  the stock s beta of 0 58 is likely to keep it protected from the market tussles  Waste Management also showcases upward revisions in its estimates for 2016  over the past 90 days   making it a solid bet Finally  one can take a look at leading communications equipment manufacturer  Motorola Solutions  Inc    NYSE MSI    This Zacks Rank  2 company has seen its estimates rise for 2016  over the past couple of months  and also flaunts a value score of  B   Additionally  this Illinois based company has a beta of 0 45 that makes it a safe bet  The company s past performance further adds a cherry on the cake as it has topped bottom line estimates consistently over the past four quarters So  it s time you book your profits  by placing your money in these safe havens Confidential  Zacks  Best Investment Ideas  Would you like to see a hand picked  all star  selection of investment ideas from the man who heads

The US stock market hit all time highs this week despite the second quarter of 2016 being another quarter with negative earnings growth  While there are still a few more earnings announcements to be released before the quarter is closed out  it looks as if earnings were down approximately 5  from the same quarter a year ago  This will be the sixth consecutive quarter with declining earnings   not the stuff of which record high stock prices are made 
The stock market continues to sleep walk  The S P 500 finished up 0 2  today at 2187  making today our 29th straight day without a 1  move  Energy stocks led the way  The Russell 2000 outperformed by a significant margin  and transports also impressed 
On August 3rd  oil hit a low of  39 96 per barrel  since then it has gained more than 20    technically a bull market in oil  Although it should be noted that bull and bear markets in oil are becoming the norm  we ve seen 20  plus swings in January  April and June this year  We have seen an oil glut push prices lower  pushing some producers out of business  shutting down rigs in the oil patch  we have heard OPEC jawbone about freezing output 
When we hear about production cuts we also hear that Saudia Arabia has increased output to an all time high to gain leverage in those OPEC talks  You might be forgiven if you believe the wild swings in oil are a result of supply demand changes  but the fundamentals haven t changed enough to justify the dramatic price changes 
It seems like everyone forgot that OPEC disappointed at the June meeting  when many market observers were looking for a production freeze  Traders remain encouraged by the Fed s dovish twist yesterday  which is pushing down the dollar  But at the heart of the big price moves in oil  is pure speculation   gambling 
Still  the price of oil is approximately half what it was 2 years ago  and that is having some very real repercussions  During the second quarter earnings season  several companies that aren t in the energy sector continued to mention declines in their businesses in oil producing areas 
Harley Davidson saw a jump in the number of people in oil heavy regions who were defaulting on loan payments  Caesars Entertainment said a lot of weakness was in the southeastern US  And Popeyes demonstrates that it s not only consumer spending on big ticket items that has fallen  Seems workers in the oil patch are less likely to buy fried chicken and biscuits  It s a pretty good excuse anyway 
The Fed is worried about a couple of things  The minutes from the July FOMC meeting had a little bit of everything  suggesting the Fed still wasn t sure when the next rate hike would occur  While there were numerous positives  the Fed suggested it was particularly worried about banks in Italy and stretched valuations in the US commercial real estate market  That left Fed fund futures implying balanced odds that there ll be a rate hike by the end of 2016   a probability that s not much changed from before the minutes 
Jobless claims last week fell by 4 000 to 262 000  representing a one month low  marking the 76th straight week that claims have been below 300 000   that hasn t happened since 1970  when the economy and the population was much smaller 
Employment figures for Arizona for the month of July showed the state lost 14 800 jobs and the unemployment rate increased two tenths of a percentage point from 5 8  in June to 6 0  in July  the national rate is at 4 9   Still  Arizona Nonfarm employment grew by 3 0   76 100 jobs  over the year in July 
Meanwhile  the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia s barometer of regional manufacturing activity rebounded slightly into positive territory in August 
Five years after the housing recovery began  5 9 million borrowers still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth  The negative equity rate is falling  now at 12 percent of all mortgaged homeowners  according to Zillow  down from more than 14 percent a year ago and more than 30 percent at the worst of the crisis  The numbers  however  are still well above normal levels and equally spread across urban and suburban communities 
Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  got even bigger during the second quarter  as the company s revenue and earnings topped Wall Street forecasts  and it reported its biggest same store sales gain in four years  Wal Mart raised its full year outlook in wake of the strong results after reporting earnings of  1 07 a share in the fiscal second quarter  slightly lower than last year s  1 08 a share  Revenue grew 0 5 percent to  120 85 billion 
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is cutting jobs  The company announced adjusted earnings of  0 63 a share on a 2  jump in revenue to  12 64 billion  Both numbers were ahead of estimates  Additionally  Cisco said it would eliminate 5 500 jobs  or 7  of its workforce  well below the job cuts of 14 000 job that were reported on Tuesday 
Nestle  SIX NESN  had a distinctly average first half  The Switzerland based maker of Kit Kat candy and DiGiorno frozen pizza reported first half revenue of  45 billion  and 3 5  organic growth  Net profit fell to  4 2 billion  missing estimates despite healthy sales in North America 
Lenovo  OTC LNVGY  had a stellar first quarter  The world s biggest PC maker enjoyed a 64  leap in profit from the same time a year ago  boosted by  132 million from the sale of some Beijing real estate  It s not all sunshine  Lenovo reported a 30  slowdown in global smartphone sales  and doesn t expect its mobile division  which includes Motorola  NYSE MSI  handsets  to make a profit before October 2017

111416,332931,MSI,Mexico s IFT Defers 2 5 GHz Band Wireless Spectrum Auction,opinion,"Mexico s telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT  recently deferred the planned auction of its 2 5 GHz band  2500MHz 2690MHz  wireless spectrum  It has been postponed from second half of 2016 to first quarter of 2017  Notably  wireless spectrums of 2 5 GHz band are very suitable for the deployment of 4G LTE networks 
The reason for the delay is to coincide it with a change in the bidding schedule for 4G LTE shared wireless network using 90 MHz of spectrum within the 700 MHz band to cover nearly 98  of the population by 2018  In 2014  the Mexican government had undertaken this massive project of shared wireless network to instil competition in the highly monopolistic telecom industry

In May 2015  the government of Mexico slashed its planned expenditure from  10 billion to  7 billion for the proposed deployment of the nationwide wholesale mobile network over a period of 10 years  The primary reason for the cut in the planned expenditure was the government s belief that 12 000 mobile towers should suffice for the installation of this network as against 20 000 estimated previously

111428,332943,MSI,Another Delay In Mexico 4G Shared Network Tender Results,opinion,"Mexico s telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT  has delayed the declaration of the names of the winners of its 700 MHz nationwide shared broadband network for the second time 
Mexico s Secretariat of Communications and Transport  SCT  was supposed to declare the tender winners on Aug 24  2016  Last month  the government institute postponed it to Sep 28  The SCT cited the number of tenders and the complexity of queries and requests for clarification submitted by the bidders as the primary reason for the delay 
Recently  the IFT further delayed the date to Nov 17  The regulator said the latest delay was partly the result of a consultation between the SCT and the auction bidders and partly a request from the banks backing the scheme  The IFT stated that interested bidders can submit their bids latest by Oct  20  and the contract will be signed upon meeting the necessary criteria by auction winners  The last day of signing the contract is Jan 27  2017 
In 2014  the Mexican government had undertaken a massive project of shared wireless network to instil competition in the highly monopolistic telecom industry  The idea was to facilitate small scale telecom operators to use this state owned network for their wireless coverage instead of installing their own network  which tends to be a highly capital intensive process 
However  in May 2015  the government of Mexico slashed its planned expenditure from  10 billion to  7 5 billion for the proposed deployment of the nationwide wholesale mobile network over the next 20 years  The primary reason for the cut in planned expenditure was the government s belief that 12 000 mobile towers should suffice for the installation of this network as against 20 000 estimated earlier 
The SCT opened the tender for the proposed wholesale shared mobile network project as early as Mar  2015  However  the auction finally materialized on Jan 29  2016  The SCT had decided to auction at least 90 MHz of spectrum within the 700 MHz band to cover at least 85  of the population by 2018  Over the past three years  Mexico witnessed a surge in mobile broadband penetration from 22  to 57

Telecommunications Stocks About to Report Q1 Earnings

With the earnings season in full swing  predictions of negative earnings growth remain the major talking point  However  as more and more companies report their earnings  actual results are turning out to be better than initially perceived  The extent of earnings and revenue beats this season is perhaps due to already lowered expectations as analysts had factored in the headwinds  bringing estimates down to easy to beat levels  Our  foresees an 8  decline in earnings and a 1  dip in revenues for the quarter on a year over year basis  Although data indicates the fourth consecutive quarter of an earnings decline  it should be noted that the degree of southward estimate revisions has slowed down considerably as the earnings season unfolded 

Notably  earnings for the current quarter are expected to be down 5 1   as per the   on the back of 0 8  lower revenues  So  is the  Earnings Recession  for real  We leave that for time to answer  For now  let s focus on some telecommunication stocks  specifically communication equipment companies that are expected to report their quarterly results early next week 

Industry Trends

Major customers for the communication equipment manufacturing and servicing companies include telecom operators and cable Multi Service Operators  MSO   who rely on the former to expand their wireless and wireline networks  With the recent development of over the top  OTT  services and other network concepts like Internet of Things  IoT  gaining momentum  revenue prospects look promising for this industry over the near term  Moreover  telecom companies and cable MSOs are always investing in newer technologies like high speed Gigabit fiber optical networks  DOCSIS 3 1 and 5G networks  As new standards for networking emerge  these communication infrastructure companies have a pivotal role to play in innovation and smooth transition to such standards  However  a soft economic outlook can force major telecom companies to defer investment plans  thereby affecting revenues going forward 

Stocks in Focus

CenturyLink has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of 0 00   Based on this combination  our proven model does not conclusively show that CenturyLink is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  Last quarter  CenturyLink delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23 08    Read More    

Motorola Solutions  Inc      NYSE MSI    is scheduled to release first quarter 2016 earnings on May 5  after the market closes  The company anticipates a 4 6  decline in revenues in the first quarter on a year over year basis  assuming an adverse currency impact of  20 million

111452,332967,MSI,Mexico 4G Shared Network Tender Results Due In September,opinion,Recently  Mexico s Secretariat of Communications and Transport  SCT  has confirmed that it will announce the names of the winners of its 700 MHz nationwide shared broadband network on Sep 29  2016  The SCT was initially slated to declare the tender winners on Aug 24  The SCT cited the number of tenders and the complexity of queries and requests for clarification submitted by the bidders as the primary reason for the delay In 2014  the Mexican government had undertaken a massive project of shared wireless network to instil competition in the highly monopolistic telecom industry  The idea was to facilitate small scale telecom operators to use this state owned network for their wireless coverage instead of installing their own network  which tends to be a highly capital intensive process However  in May 2015  the government of Mexico slashed its planned expenditure from  10 billion to  7 billion for the proposed deployment of the nationwide wholesale mobile network over the next 20 years  The primary reason for the cut in planned expenditure was the government s belief that 12 000 mobile towers should suffice for the installation of this network as against 20 000 estimated earlier The SCT opened the tender for the proposed wholesale shared mobile network project as early as Mar 2015  However  the auction finally materialized on Jan 29  2016  The SCT has decided to auction at least 90 MHz of spectrum within the 700 MHz band to cover nearly 98  of the population by 2018 Various leading telecom infrastructure equipment developers with global operational experience offered bids for the state owned mobile network project  Notable among them were Ericsson  ST ERICAs  AB   NASDAQ ERIC    Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp    NYSE NOK    Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Motorola Solutions Inc    NYSE MSI    China Telecom Corp  Ltd    NYSE CHA    Alestra  and Huawei Technologies Co  Ltd  The SCT received 39 tenders from interested parties Mexico is the largest economy in the Latin American region with a growing middle class population eager to spend more on high speed wireless networks to facilitate the use of smartphones and tablets  Also  the wireless penetration rate is relatively low in the country  Given the potential for growth  an investment in the nation may bode well for telecom network equipment manufacturers ,2016-05-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mexico-4g-shared-network-tender-results-due-in-september-200133352,200133352
111453,332968,MSI,Telecom Stock Roundup  Workers  Strike Ends At Verizon  AT T To Bid For Yahoo ,opinion,Though it hasn t been a very eventful week for telecom companies  a few developments were worth noting  Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   has entered into a tentative deal with two workers  unions whose members went to strike from Apr 13  2016 Verizon and the striking unions  The Communications Workers of America  CWA  and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  IBEW   have almost resolved their differences and nearly 36 500 workers in the company s wireline and cable TV  FiOS Internet and TV  segment resumed work on Jun 1  2016  Union members will vote on the tentative contract by Jun 17 Meanwhile  the race to take over Yahoo  Inc    NASDAQ YHOO   intensified with the U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T   making a bid for the company  Yahoo has reportedly received more than 10 initial bids ranging from around US 4 billion to  8 billion Among the notable bidders are Verizon and private equity firm TPG Capital LP  Before AT T came into the picture  Verizon was considered as best suited to merge Yahoo into its online platform  However  the entry of AT T may change the entire landscape In a separate development  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   is gradually expanding its 4G LTE coverage in the U S  Recently  the company has entered into an agreement with AT T to acquire spectrum in the 700 MHz band  This will help the company to provide LTE network in the greater Chicago area  AT T had acquired this license as part of its takeover of Leap Wireless two years ago  Although the financial terms of the T Mobile US   AT T deal have been kept under wraps  the transaction is likely to be closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 Outside the U S   two important developments took place in the Mexican telecom space  Mexico s Secretariat of Communications and Transport  SCT  has confirmed that it will announce the names of the winners of its 700 MHz nationwide shared broadband network on Sep 29  2016  The SCT was initially slated to declare the tender winners on Aug 24  The SCT cited the number of tenders and the complexity of queries and requests for clarification submitted by the bidders as the primary reason for the delay Various leading telecom infrastructure equipment developers with global operational experience offered bids for the state owned mobile network project  Notable among them were Ericsson  ST ERICAs  AB   NASDAQ ERIC    Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp    NYSE NOK    Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Motorola Solutions Inc    NYSE MSI    China Telecom Corp  Ltd    NYSE CHA     Alestra  and Huawei Technologies Co  Ltd  The SCT received 39 tenders from interested parties Additionally  Mexican telecom regulator  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT or Ifetel  recently granted concessions for the 1710 1780 MHz 2110 2180 MHz AWS frequency bands to America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   and AT T  On Feb 15  2016  the IFT opened an auction for 80 MHz of wireless spectrum across various Advanced Wireless Services  AWS  bands  America Movil and AT T emerged as the two winners of the spectrum auction Read the last  Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     Verizon and its wireline workers were at a stalemate over a labor contract  The company s wireline employees have been working out of contract since August last year  Under the new contract  Verizon will provide a 10 9  pay rise to its unionized workers over a period of four years  a small increment in pension benefit and a promise to create nearly 1 400 new union jobs  Importantly  the company agreed to reduce subcontracting and withdrew a proposal to relocate employees for extended periods  These were the main issues of the strike  read more   2     AT T was already involved in the Yahoo takeover process through its subsidiary and Yellow Pages owner YP LLC  However  after the direct entry of A T as a bidder  its subsidiary YP LLC  opted out of the race  Last year  AT T acquired DIRECTV  the largest satellite TV operator in the U S  AT T plans to offer online streaming video service this year  using the DIRECTV brand  The acquisition of Yahoo would help AT T to provide ad delivered Internet contents to the smartphone friendly next gen  read more    3     The U S  telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products  At this juncture  we believe T Mobile US  decision to expand 4G LTE network and its drive for 5G wireless network will prepare the ground for future growth  read more   4     The Mexican telecom regulator  IFT s concession will enable America Movil and AT T to have contiguous blocks of spectrum  which will provide them with higher data transfer speeds whereby they can offer better mobile services  Notably  AWS spectrums are highly coveted for the deployment of 4G LTE networks  The IFT is looking to collect  2 5 billion over the next 15 years from this spectrum auction  including initial bids and yearly payments for spectrum licenses  read more   5     In 2014  the Mexican government had undertaken a massive project of shared wireless network to instill competition in the highly monopolistic telecom industry  The idea was to facilitate small scale telecom operators to use this state owned network for their wireless coverage instead of installing their own network  which tends to be a highly capital intensive process  However  in May 2015  the government of Mexico slashed its planned expenditure from  10 billion to  7 billion for the proposed deployment of the nationwide wholesale mobile network over the next 20 years  read more   Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major telecom players over the past week and the last six months Over the last five trading sessions  share price movement of the major telecom stocks was predominantly positive  DISH Network  NASDAQ DISH   12 28   and Sprint  6 80   gained

111467,332982,MSI,Top Alpha Stories of 2015  Nerds Win 3  Lose 2,opinion,"We have made it a habit to present  at this time of year  a short list of the big news stories of the 12 months just past  insofar as they have affected alternative asset managers and their investors 
We re happy to observe  as preface to this year s version  that our list received some social media push back last year  Tweets suggested that we had played matters too  safe  and ended up with a beta hunters list rather than a truly alpha oriented compendium  Well   we re happy our critics are paying attention  though we have no idea whether they ll be any happier with this list than they were with that one 
So we move forward  This year s big stories read a bit as if Sheldon Cooper had decided to make a splash in the world of alternative investments  They are about statistics  algorithms  and some basic science  Though since the basic science involved in the first tem below is biology rather than physics  we should perhaps have invoked Amy Farrah Fowler rather than Sheldon  But let us proceed 
Excitement in Biopharm
These are exciting times in the world of basic biological medical research  They ve been exciting at least since the completion of the map of the human genome in 2003  when attention turned to what can be done with that map 
At almost the same moment in those early years of a new millennium enterprising people and institutions invented the  gene chip   a glass slide containing thousands of DNA sequences in an ordered array  The chip zeroes in on the sequences that do particular jobs  abstracting a particular geological class of mountain form the broader  map   so to speak 
The take off of science in this area has interacted with a lot of other developments  including a regulatory version of arterial sclerosis  and a build up of the cost management pressures attending the world of Obamacare  All this has given us a hedge fund tug of war over Clovis Oncology  the meteoric career of Martin Shkreli  and much more 
Automation  Dapps  etc  
Though the theme this year is ascent of the nerds  we are compelled to mention two stories where the nerds seem to have fallen short  We reported back in March that block chains as a technology had gone far beyond bitcoins or other decentralized currencies  rendering possible robot like corporations in the process  and we  as to how the law may have to follow where this trend was headed 
Alas  though  anyone working on bringing those robot corporations into reality has had a slow year since 
Maidsafe  a  massive array of internet disks  designed to give greater privacy security than users of the Google Facebook dominated internet have come to expect  hosts a blog devoted to the innovative uses of block chains  But the recent blog entries there have indicated little forward momentum  They have been  instead  tedious discussions of terminology  what exactly is a  decentralized  network and how does it differ from a  distributed  network  That sort of thing 
Maybe there isn t a lot of money to be made there  Just now  anyway  Let s move along 
Dubious Claims about Black Swans
The year just passed also saw news that might confirm the theory that every revolution leaves much unchanged  that  the fundamental things apply as time goes by  
On August 28 a story appeared in  asserting that Universa Investments LP had just made  1 billion on the bad news from China  which had spiked volatility and fattened the tails of black swans everywhere  That  1 billion seemed a very practical bottom line confirmation of the long anticipated fractal revolution in finance  King Gauss was dead  long live King Mandelbrot 
Here the real story is that the story was wrong  Further  much the same claim had been made  and had unraveled in much the same way  in 2009  Fool me once shame on you  Fool me twice  
Yes  there is a strong case to be made that the standard model has long understated risks  because the bell curve doesn t describe the distribution of financial outcomes properly  The safest conclusion from efforts to replace that model with anew equally actionable alternative is that this is doable but it isn t really scalable  So   black swan funds are here to stay  but talk of billion dollar overnight payoffs will remain just talk  Until of course  inflation proceeds to the point at which a  billion  means a good deal less than it does 
Big Dogs Make Big Bets on Big Data 
After two items on dogs that didn t bark  or that were wrongly thought to have barked  we get to return to actual canines making actual noise 
The year 2015 witnessed Silver Lake Resources s  AX SLR   1 billion purchase of convertible senior notes of Motorola Solutions  NYSE N MSI  payable in five years  The deal also involves the arrival of two Silver Lake managing partners as directors of MSI  Silver Lake is barking up a very specific tree within the forest of Big Data  the market for law enforcement analytics 
The chart at the top of this entry shows MSI s stock price through the year ending December 24  2015  The big drop at the beginning of April indicates investor frustration when MSI gave up on its efforts to find a buyer and instead became a buyer    a privately held provider of prescriptive policing data 
Though as you can see the market s reaction to the deal was unenthusiastic  MSI continued its own acquisitive course  entering into a partnership with New Zealand s Wynyard Group on June  thus acquiring software that will help Motorola s own services connect the dots  as a press release put it  among  multiple databases and evidence libraries to help investigators quickly prevent and solve crime  
In addition to this deal making and the new focus on crime solving data  MSI in the summer had started showing growth momentum with the release of its second quarter results  Silver Lake s investment was a natural response to this successful turn around 
Of course there is much more to Big Bata than Big Policework  But the one can serve as a synecdoche of the other 
Consolidation of the Chemical Industry 
Finally  we ll mention the consolidation of the chemical industry  This has been a multi year trend  but it drew our attention in mid year when Platform Specialty bought Alent for  2 3 billion  and with the blessing of activist investor Cevian Cap 
Then our interest in that matter seemed almost quaint when the year went out with a real chem industry bang  the proposed merger of Dow Chemical Company  N DOW  and DuPont  N DD   a deal which is in large part the consequence of pressure from alpha seeker Nelson Peltz 
Asia is driving deal volumes in chem industry M A  That continent represents more than 42  of the merger activity in this market  This dominance derives in part from China s need to reduce air pollution and in the process  to improve the efficiency of its industrial processes 
Looking at this market by segments  both specialty chemicals and the fertilizer   ag segment showed a lot of merger activity in 2015  Low commodity process could be driving the moves in the latter of those  and those same low prices are a factor in the Dow DuPont announcement ",2015-12-30,AllAboutAlpha,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-alpha-stories-of-2015:-nerds-win-three,-lose-two-377834",377834

111485,333000,MSI,Patent Deaths Spell Danger For These Firms,opinion,"Failing to innovate is a virtual death sentence for any company  Think Sears  NASDAQ SHLD   Blockbuster  BlackBerry  NASDAQ BBRY   Motorola  NYSE MSI   Kodak  NYSE KODK   and Dell  Innovation is especially paramount to companies relying on patents to guard their market shares  Reason being  those patents will eventually expire 
If a company s innovation pipeline hasn t yielded another superstar  well  patent expiration can spell BIG TROUBLE  With that in mind  the following four companies are up against the patent cliff 
The Patent Cliff Crushes Drug Firms
When it comes to patent expiration  the statistics are particularly sobering for drug companies  Having enjoyed 20 years of market exclusivity for the drugs they ve developed  patent expiration completely turns the tide against these firms  In fact  once a drug has lost its hallowed patent protection and lower priced generic brands enter the market  the original developer can see sales crash by up to 90   Hardly surprising  given that generic drugs average about 30  of the cost of the brand name  
EP Vantage says   This year  drugs expected to go generic will leave some  38 7 billion of sales  at risk   In 2015  this figure rises to  47 5 billion   not far off the  54 7 billion that came under threat in the notorious patent expiry cliff of 2012   This is the reality facing Big Pharma companies  with many blockbuster drugs losing their patent exclusivity 
So which drug companies face an imminent patent whipping  
Patent Death  1  Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Having already lost Lipitor and Viagra to generic competitors in recent years  Pfizer s quarterly revenue and profit just dropped again  largely due to drug patent expirations  Sales of Detrol  for instance  which tackles bladder problems and whose patent expired in September 2012  plunged by 58  
In December  the company will lose exclusivity on its fourth bestselling drug  Celebrex  an anti inflammatory medication that treats arthritis  With it   3 billion in annual sales will vanish 
It s a similar story for Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY   Sales and profit also fell in its most recent quarter  as the firm battles patent expirations on depression and anxiety medication  Cymbalta  and osteoporosis drug  Evista  earlier this year  Indeed  sales volume dropped by 16  and Cymbalta sales plunged by 73  
Patent Death  2  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   While Otsuka  OTC OTSKY  is the Japanese firm behind well known drug  Abilify   which treats schizophrenia  depression  and bipolar disorder   its Otsuka America unit co markets the drug in America with Bristol Myers 
On October 20  the U S  patent on Abilify expired  But it received an extension for pediatric treatment  so there won t be a generic competitor on the market until April 2015  When there is  Bristol Myers will take a big hit  At its peak a couple of years ago  Abilify brought in around  2 9 billion in annual sales for the company  But that s expected to sink to around  1 3 billion next year  according to Trefis forecasts  and continue falling steadily all the way to a mere  200 million by 2020 
Patent Death  3  GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK   The British pharmaceutical firm makes Avodart  which treats benign prostatic hyperplasia  BPH  in men  In other words  it helps shrink an enlarged prostate and lowers the need for prostate surgery later  It also relieves prostate driven bladder problems  such as frequent or difficult urination 
The FDA approved Avodart in 2001  but Glaxo s U S  patent will expire in November 2015  The company is trying to extend Avodart s shelf life by finding other benefits beyond BPH  But the clock is ticking  and the prospects for hanging onto exclusivity don t look good 
When the FDA rejected Glaxo s bid to add prostate cancer prevention to the drug s makeup  the company suspended its efforts  And Glaxo has already successfully sued challengers who infringed on the Avodart patent by trying to create their own knockoffs  So it seems inevitable that a generic version will hit the market once the patent expires 
That would be bad news for Glaxo  as its Avodart franchise has been one of the few bright spots in a difficult year for Glaxo  According to EP Vantage  Avodart sales are expected to hit  508 million this year  but dropping to  443 million in 2015  and falling off a  patent  cliff in 2016  with just  76 million  But it s not just drug companies at risk from expiring patents 
Food Giant Set for Imminent Profit Diet
Take one of the largest players in the food industry  for example 
Patent Death  4  Monsanto  NYSE MON   According to GMO Answers  the cost of generating a new genetically modified crop is  136 million  Needless to say  firms like agriculture behemoth Monsanto rely on patents to protect these massive investments  In 2015  the patent on Monsanto s  Roundup Ready  soybean seed  RR1  will expire   and that spells trouble for Monsanto  RR1 is the world s most widely used genetically modified seed  and has been planted on billions of acres since 1996 
Once the RR1 patent expires  Monsanto will no longer have control over the seed   which could trigger a sea change in the GMO crop industry  You see  while Monsanto s seeds were patent protected  farmers couldn t collect and re plant the same seeds year after year without paying royalties to Monsanto  But starting in spring 2015  farmers will be free to save and replant the RR1 seeds at will  More importantly  the patent expiration will give other firms the opportunity to replicate the RR1 technology  This will spread the availability of GMO technology and increase competition in the market 
According to Country Folks  a weekly agricultural paper  the patent expiration could also lead to new university based crop breeding programs that would make GMO seed technology more freely available  Bottom line  While RR1 s patent expiration could mean big things for the agriculture industry as a whole  it s terrible news for Monsanto

111488,333003,MSI,Can You Actually Replace An Analyst With A Robot  ,opinion,"Last week  the  had an article entitled  Can You Tell the Difference Between a Robot and a Stock Analyst  Wall Street tries out research reports written by artificial intelligence  
Each day  Wall Street churns out millions of words encouraging investors to buy or sell stocks  bonds and mutual funds 
In the future  more of those words might not be written by humans 
As automation in financial services grows  computers and algorithms have taken on some of the traditional work of traders  clerks and financial advisers  Now  a host of startups that use artificial intelligence to write news stories and other reports have set their sights on writing work at banks and financial service companies 

The article claimed that Artificial Intelligence  or AI  is taking over much of the task of analysis 
Narrative Science Inc   which launched in 2010 with computer generated news articles  added products for financial services businesses in 2013  Those firms now account for 60  of the company s client base  Last year  Automated Insights added insurance company Allstate Corp  NYSE ALL   to a roster of clients that includes Yahoo  Inc  NASDAQ YHOO  and the Associated Press  Other startups offering automated reports for financial services firms include Yseop  Capital Cube and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  GS 0 37    backed Kensho Technologies Inc 
As artificial intelligence takes on ever more tasks  Wall Street is getting more comfortable putting it to use  Services launched in recent years are now gaining traction because the technology has become more sophisticated and banks are looking for ways to cut costs and increase efficiencies 

What do analysts do  To evaluate the claim that AI could take over the job of company analysts  let s consider the job of a sell side equity analyst  from the tasks that are the easiest to replicate to the ones that are the hardest 
Report on industry and corporate developments
Issue buy and sell recommendations
Communicate insights about a company and its industry
Most individual investors focus on  1  and  2   while institutional investors appreciate and pay for  3   Indeed  the job of reporting on industry and corporate developments could be automated today  A number of news organizations have experimented with using software to put out company earnings reports using a standardized template 
The  quant  investing robot The task of issuing buy and sell recommendations have also been computerized for years  It s called quantitative investing  but differs from fundamental investing in a key way  Typical quantitative investing techniques rely on factors  such as the insight that  low P E stocks tend to beat the market   So what you do is buy a whole bunch of low P E stocks   Where quantitative investing differs from the kind of fundamental investing done by company analysts is the degree of confidence in the forecast  Quants tend to take a statistical approach and buy a large and broad portfolio of low P E names  whereas a company specific fundamental analyst will have a far higher level of confidence in his forecast 
Richard Grinold pioneered a principle of portfolio management called  The Fundamental Law of Active Management  which boiled down to the idea that you should bet in proportion to the degree of confidence you have in your forecast alpha  see my previous discussion    Based on those ideas  a typical quant portfolio will hold between 100 300 stocks  because it is betting on factors or models  whereas a typical fundamentally driven stock picking portfolio will have 20 60 names 
Today  you can buy quantitative system insights from outfits like Value Line  which has had an impressive multi decade track record  and ranks stocks with Timeliness rankings of 1  best  to 5  worst   Does that count as a robot replacement   Yes  I know that Value Line has human analysts  but not all ranking systems do and I use Value Line purely as an example of a quantitatively driven buy hold sell system  
What is fundamental analysis  It is the more  creative  part of fundamental analysis that will be difficult for AI software to replicate and model 
Let me give you an example  Early in my career  I had the privilege to work with a small cap analyst who went on to be a portfolio manager and now the co head of equities of a major asset management firm  From watching what  Doug  did  I gained invaluable insights that made me a much better quant later in my own career  Small cap analysis is different from being an industry analyst because the drivers for each company and industry are different  When he picked up coverage of a company  Doug would spend several weeks chasing down what he believed the important drivers of value for a company by speaking to the company  its competitors  suppliers  customers and industry association  He would often waste days and weeks chasing down blind alleys only to discover that the issue that he was researching was irrelevant  Only once he had developed a framework for understanding how the business worked would he actually build the spreadsheet for valuing the company s shares 
Can AI software do that  I doubt it  largely because we don t fully understand how human creativity works yet 
No doubt  we can build software to perform analysis according to certain standardized templates  Perhaps smart software might have been able to read financial statement footnotes to figure out the kinds of risks that Enron had been taking  as the Street seemed oblivious  Can software do channel checks to gain insights as to the public perception of a new product launch  maybe  Those levels of sophistication are probably one or two generations ahead   for now 
As well  investment insights are multi dimensional and different fundamental analysts may have different insights that institutional investors find valuable and will pay for  As an example  I recall that as a portfolio manager  I derived different levels of understanding of tech darling Nokia  NYSE NOK  during the late 1990 s from different analysts 
The American analysts were much better at business strategy  Nokia was the dominant producer of cellphones and had enormous economies of scale advantages to their then rivals like Motorola  NYSE MSI   Ericsson  ST ERICAs   Samsung  KS 005930  and others  Nokia s handset operating margins were in the high teens whereas the margins of their best competitors were in either high single digits or low teens  That  reasoned many US analysts  was a source of competitive advantage for Nokia and what made the stock a buy 
By contrast  the European analysts were much better at on the ground analysis of the success  or failure  of new handset models rolled out by the major European handset makers  That kind of channel check insight was also a source of tactical advantage  In effect  I read research from the American brokers for the big picture and spoke to the local European brokers because they knew where all the bodies were buried 
Risk is multi dimensional  Alpha is multi dimensional  We are not at that stage of software development where AI can give us insights for everything  True  many of the basic reporting functions can be replaced by software   that s not where the real analytical insight comes from

111498,333013,MSI,Google Earnings Review  Profitability Weakens Again,opinion,I repeat  this isn t the Google  GOOG  that Granny used to talk about  Things have changed significantly  That is  Google fundamentals have changed with the acquisition and merger of Motorola  MSI  in Q2 2012  Fundamentals Change With Motorola Acquisition   Motorola is negatively affecting financial performance  Google s core business is not as profitable and therefore is also negatively affecting financial performance Both the revenue mix and margin mix have changed and hence the uncertainty about Google s operations  This will continue negatively  impacting the bottom line  net income and earnings per share  at least for the short term  The top line revenues surge upwards with no positive bottom line impact  The long term impact is the uncertainty The 3rd and 4th calendar quarters can be the strongest for Google on an annual cyclical basis  The solid gains in net income and earnings per share were not reported year over year as expected  That leaves next quarter  the Holiday Q4  for a rebound  Holiday Q4 should be stronger than the current Q3  but the annual surge in earnings per share may not follow suit Revenue growth  year over year  had previously slowed but the Motorola acquisition reversed the trend significantly to the upside  Yet this has not mattered with regards to net income nor earnings per share  Consolidated margins decreased significantly  caused mostly by Motorola but to some extent by core operations  Net income and operating income continue decreasing on record revenues  the result of the gross profit margin  then operating margin  then net margin dropping to multi year lows And finally we arrive at the earnings per share and ultimately GOOG stock prospects  The race and goal is to become the Anti Apple with integration across software and hardware while continuing as an advertising company  Whether this can in fact be done  how long it will take  and if Apple s profitability levels can be reached are the 3 questions and uncertainties  We had a strong quarter  Revenue was up 45 percent year on year  and  at just fourteen years old  we cleared our first  14 billion revenue quarter   said Larry Page  CEO of Google   I am also really excited about the progress we re making creating a beautifully simple  intuitive Google experience across all devices  ,2012-10-21,David Dyer,https://www.investing.com/analysis/google-earnings-review:-profitability-weakens-again-140542,140542
