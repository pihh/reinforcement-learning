30406,251921,GL,Should Value Investors Pick Globe Life  GL  Stock Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Globe Life  Inc   NYSE GL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Globe Life has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 20  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 27  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Globe Life puts current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 14 52  over the past five years  However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 25  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Globe Life has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 80  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Globe Life s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Globe Life has a P S ratio of about 2 50  This is slightly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Globe Life currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes GL a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Globe Life might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives GL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while full year 2020 estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has also nudged up 0 3   in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Globe Life Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineGlobe Life is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 41  out of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors and industry trend to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2019-11-21,Zacks Investment

30545,252060,GL,GL Vs  MCO  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Financial   Miscellaneous Services sector have probably already heard of Torchmark  NYSE GL  and Moody s  MCO   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Torchmark is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Moody s has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that GL is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
GL currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 08  while MCO has a forward P E of 26 49  We also note that GL has a PEG ratio of 1 85  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2 65 
Another notable valuation metric for GL is its P B ratio of 1 55  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MCO has a P B of 70 12 
These metrics  and several others  help GL earn a Value grade of B  while MCO has been given a Value grade of F 
GL is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that GL is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-09-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gl-vs-mco-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200464498,200464498

30569,252084,GL,GL Vs  VIRT  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Financial   Miscellaneous Services sector have probably already heard of Torchmark  GL  and Virtu Financial  VIRT   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  Torchmark is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Virtu Financial has a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that GL has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
GL currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 94  while VIRT has a forward P E of 14 52  We also note that GL has a PEG ratio of 1 70  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  VIRT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 90 
Another notable valuation metric for GL is its P B ratio of 1 43  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  VIRT has a P B of 2 54 
These metrics  and several others  help GL earn a Value grade of B  while VIRT has been given a Value grade of D 
GL sticks out from VIRT in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that GL is the better option right now ",2019-08-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gl-vs-virt-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200458928,200458928

30646,252161,GL,Should Value Investors Consider Torchmark  TMK  Stock Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s Torchmark Corporation  NYSE TMK   TMK  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Torchmark has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 04  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 89  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Torchmark scurrent PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 05  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Torchmark has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 28  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Torchmark stock in the near term too     P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Torchmark has a P S ratio of about 2 28  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  TMK is near the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of overvalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Torchmark currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Torchmark a solid choice for value investors     What About the Stock Overall  Though Torchmark might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives TMK a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction  while the current year estimate has seen four upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 3  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has risen by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Torchmark Corporation Price and Consensus
 

   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Torchmark is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 19  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Insurance   Life Insurance industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-consider-torchmark-tmk-stock-now-200430977,200430977

30768,252283,GL,Torchmark  TMK  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Torchmark  TMK  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This life and health insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 11 billion  up 3 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 41  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Torchmark 
For Torchmark  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 94  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Torchmark will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Torchmark would post earnings of  1 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 56  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Torchmark appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/torchmark-tmk-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200405547,200405547

Buy ranked Roche s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the past six months  gaining  10 5  vs  a decline of  1 0   The Zacks analyst thinks Roche posted strong sales for the first quarter of 2019  propelled by demand for new drugs amid biosimilar competition for legacy drugs  Consequently  the company raised its guidance for the year  
Strong performance of Ocrevus  Perjeta  Tecentriq and Hemlibra offset lower sales of MabThera Rituxan  In particular  MS drug Ocrevus witnessed strong growth  driven by increased demand  Also  label expansion of Tecentriq into various indications contributed to first quarter sales  
Meanwhile  the company is looking to restructure its portfolio beyond oncology into MS and haemophilia  among others  Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs

Shares of Danaher have gained  19 7  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has increased  16 5  over the same period  In first quarter of 2019  the company s earnings and sales beat estimates  
The Zacks analyst thinks sturdier demand for innovative products  effective Danaher Business System   DBS   implementation and shareholder friendly policies will likely bolster profitability going forward  Also  it anticipates that the acquisition of General Electric  NYSE GE  Company s BioPharma business will complement its biologics workflow solutions of the Life Sciences segment  The divestiture of its dental business will boost its competency  
However  rising cost of sales and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies might continue to restrict Danaher s growth  For 2019  the company lowered adjusted earnings per share guidance  primarily reflecting dilutive impact of funds raised for the BioPharma buyout 
 You can   
BlackRock s shares have gained  22 5  in the past six months  outperforming the Zacks Investment Management industry s increase of  15 5  during the same period  The company s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
The Zacks analyst thinks its first quarter 2019 results benefited from lower expenses and higher assets under management  AUM   partly offset by lower revenues  The company s initiatives to restructure its actively managed equity business  and expand globally via acquisitions to further boost top line and AUM remain impressive  
While a steady increase in operating expenses and high dependence on overseas revenues remain matters of concern  the company s capital deployment actions reflect strong balance sheet position

The Federal Reserve has already made nine rate hikes since December 2015  reflecting improving economic conditions  However  the central bank may not raise rates in 2019 against its earlier expectation of two raises due to slowing economic growth and sluggish inflation  The rate currently stands at 2 50  compared with the near  zero level at the time of the financial crisis  Life insurers invest a big chunk they receive as premiums so that they have enough funds at the time of claims or upon maturity  Since higher interest rates help the industry  absence of a rate hike could weigh on investment income and reinvestment rate  A strong labor market  with declining unemployment and rising wages  are driving policy sales even at higher premiums  Also  growth in aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products Life insurers have been gradually adopting technology in their daily operations  Carriers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech savvy population  At the same time  the use of real time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk  The increased usage of health and fitness app over a period of time is helping towards the cause  Moreover  adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence  AI   robotic process automation  RPA   cognitive intelligence  CI  or blockchain should help life insurers curb operational costs Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright prospects in the near term  The Zacks Life Insurance industry  which is a 16 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  23  which places it in the top 9  of 256 Zacks industries

30842,252357,GL,Abercrombie And Fitch  Cars com  Health Insurance Innovations  Aflac And Torchmark Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   March 14  2019    Abercrombie and Fitch   NYSE ANF   as the Bull of the Day  Cars com   NYSE CARS   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Health Insurance Innovations  Inc    NASDAQ HIIQ    Aflac Inc    NYSE AFL   and Torchmark Corp    NYSE TMK   
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 
 
Abercrombie and Fitch is in the midst of a successful reinvention 
You don t have to be too old to remember the days when the Abercrombie image consisted of attractive young models spritzing fragrances on passerby in front of nightclub themed mall stores  Though the strategy seems dated now   how many mall shoppers want to be accosted by a shirtless guy with a bottle of perfume    it actually worked well for a while and Abercrombie became one of the world s most popular brands of clothing and accessories for teens and young adults 
By 2014  management at Abercrombie astutely realized that they were going to need a new strategy in order to continue to appeal to the notoriously fickle tastes of younger consumers  The result is a new digital approach that uses a diverse set of media outlets to support the company s brands and styles and keep them relevant to their target audiences and also provides a convenient and easy way for those consumers to buy goods directly from the company 
The Brand Strategy
ANF operates three separate brands   Abercrombie and Fitch for the 21 24 age group  Hollister for teens and college students and Abercrombie Kids  targeting consumers from 7 14  or their parents  
The new strategy involves closing underperforming retail locations and remodeling existing locations to utilize a smaller footprint  It also emphasizes direct to consumer sales through the company s digital  omni channel   which was designed to create a best in class customer experience while simultaneously growing profitability 
Abercrombie closed 29 stores in 2018 and plans to shutter 40 more in 2019  In most cases  store closures happen when a poorly performing outlet reaches the end of its current lease  greatly reducing the cost of shuttering locations 
Approximately 50  of existing store leases expire within the next three years  providing the company flexibility in their decisions to keep or close individual stores 
The new marketing effort focuses heavily on internet and social media channels and a reduced presence in traditional media  The company uses  influencers  on Twitter  Instagram and other platforms and  recently produced an original Television series for YouTube  Broadcast on their  Awesomeness TV  channel   The Carpe Life  features appealing glimpses of teen life while subtly including the companies wares 
After a difficult stretch in 2016 that was highlighted by four consecutive earnings misses due to slow sales and rising expenses  Abercrombie has been on a tear ever since  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate eight consecutive times  highlighted by a 20  beat in the first quarter of 2019 
Net Q1 earnings at Abercrombie were  1 35 share versus an expected  1 12 share  Revenues were  1 16B  slightly topping estimates of  1 13B  The earnings improvement was largely the result of the cost saving of operating fewer retail locations and selling more product online  Roughly a third of sales occur through the online portal 
Same store sales increased for a sixth straight quarter   a predictable outcome given the closure of low performing retail locations  Full year Store Operating Expenses across the company in 2018 were  629M  a significant reduction from 2017 s  659M 
Abercrombie s guidance for 2019 prompted an immediate runup in the shares  which rallied 20  the day following the Q1 report 
The company expects net sales to increase 2 4   same store sales up  low single digits   and gross profit to continue to increase 
Analyst expectations for the coming two years increased almost immediately after the Q1 report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2019 has risen 42  since before the most recent report and the estimate for 2020 is up almost 100  
 
A study by consumer automobile website Edmunds com found that Americans rate  buying a car  more stressful than  getting married  
What if you could buy a car with all the features you desire from the comfort of your own home  You d get a low  no haggle price and all the help you need with delivery and service  but without ever setting foot in a traditional dealership or talking to a salesman 
Well that s happening  slowly but surely  but Cars com is not going to help you 
Though the name promises a high tech alternative to the traditional dealership model  the reality leaves much to be desired  Cars com doesn t sell  or buy  automobiles  They function as an intermediary between buyers and sellers   and most often the sellersare dealers 
Through its recently acquired Dealer Inspire business  the company promises a faster and easier buying process  but the sellers are still traditional dealers   albeit in sheep s clothing 
Automakers would love to eliminate their independent dealer networks and sell direct to consumers  but numerous roadblocks have been erected over the past 100 years or so  Archaic state laws that were originally intended to protect small independent dealerships from predatory practices by manufacturers now have essentially the opposite effect  allowing well capitalized dealer ownership groups to stand in the way of the progress desired by both automakers and consumers 
When Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  began selling cars directly to consumers  it wasn t other manufacturers who objected  it was dealer networks who feared the imminent demise of their cash cows  Tesla didn t have a legacy of restrictive contracts with dealers to keep it from selling its own autos  but   even after protracted legal battles and many victories   the company remains prohibited or restricted from selling its own vehicles in 6 US states 
It s nothing less than an assault on the free market and it takes money out of the pockets ofconsumers and automakers alike to enrich politically connected fat cat auto dealers 
Luckily  it looks like it s finally coming to an end 
Automakers are preparing for a sea change in the way we buy and use automobiles and it s not likely to involve dealer networks  Ride sharing is already taking a big bite out of ownership figures  especially younger people  and autonomous vehicles will do the same 
Manufacturers are also experimenting with subscription services that allow consumers to drive the vehicle of their choice and make trades without ever actually taking ownership of a car  Private businesses like Flexdrive  Carma and Clutch offer similar services 
Selling advertising for auto dealers is a business with a limited future and Cars com s recent earnings estimate revisions exemplify the concept 
In the past 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates for 2019 and 2020 have fallen 25  and 20   respectively  Those negative revisions earn Cars com a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Cars com gets a Style score of  D  in both Value and Growth and an  F  in Momentum  It s total VGM score is also a  D  
That s almost the worst report card we offer at Zacks

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Torchmark 
For Torchmark  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Torchmark will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Torchmark would post earnings of  1 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 59  delivering a surprise of  4 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Torchmark doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/torchmark-tmk-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200380569,200380569

Consensus Estimate of  2 68 by 8 2   However  the bottom line improved 13 9  year over year The Travelers Companies  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     This year over year increase in earnings can be attributed to higher net favorable prior year reserve development along with a solid underlying underwriting gain  Moreover  lower income tax expenses  driven by the reduced U S  corporate income tax rate also contributed to the upside  However  a benefit of  39 million in the prior year quarter from the settlement of prior year tax matters  partially offset this upside  Nonetheless  the bottom line was boosted by share buybacks Behind the Q1 Headlines Total revenues of Travelers rose nearly 5  from the year ago quarter to  7 3 billion  Also  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  7 2 billion  Net written premiums displayed a 5 1  year over year increase to  6 8 billion owing to growth in each business segment  namely Business and International Insurance  Bond   Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance  Net investment income slid 1 1  year over year to  603 million on lower private equity returns  Increase in fixed income returns due to higher average level of fixed maturity investments as well as short term interest rates  led to this downside Travelers reported an underwriting gain of  258 million  up 22 3  from the year ago quarter  Combined ratio improved 50 basis points  bps  year over year to 95 5  owing to higher net favorable prior year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss  However  a higher underlying combined

written premiums of  3 9 billion  up 3 6  year over year  A continued strong retention  an improved renewal premium change and a solid new business led to this upside  Combined ratio deteriorated 110 bps year over year to 97 5  due to higher underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss  However  higher net favorable prior year reserve development partially offset this downside  Segment income of  452 million grew 2 3  on the back of lower segment income before income taxes  which was more than offset by decreased income tax expense  Bond   Specialty Insurance  Net written premiums rose 5 5  year over year to  574 million  primarily driven by improved domestic surety premiums  a sustained solid retention plus an increased new business in domestic management liability  Combined ratio improved 470 bps year over year to 74 7  owing to lower underlying combined ratio as well as catastrophe loss along with higher net favorable prior year reserve development  Segment income improved 19 3  year over year to  173 million  attributable to higher segment income before income taxes  partially offset by higher income tax expense  Personal Insurance  Net written premiums increased 7 6  year over year to about  2 3 billion  Combined ratio improved 210 bps year over year to 97 5   backed by a higher net favorable prior year reserve development and a benefit derived from catastrophe loss  partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio  Segment income surged 44 9  to  129 million  attributable to higher segment income before income taxes  partially offset by

Consensus and EPS Surprise     The company s weak performance at Traditional business in the Asia Pacific  United States and Latin America regions in the reported quarter was primarily responsible for

Preview  earnings are expected to grow 5 7  on 2 8  higher revenues Industry OverviewThe insurance industry as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon to be reported quarter compared with the third  However  the insurers  underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter  This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating cat loss at approximately  10 5 billion However  such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not so active catastrophe environment  This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well Also  prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event Net investment income  an important ingredient of an insurer s top line  is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment  Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace  the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers  investment portfolios  Notably  the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017  the last one made in December  having raised enough optimism among investors Diverse product offerings  a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers  performance in the quarter to be reported Moreover  the tax reform policy   enacted in December 2017 reducing the tax rate to 21  from 35    is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent  A lower tax rate would aid the companies  bottom line  boosting margins directly  Additionally  the tax cut is estimated to make U S  insurers more competitive

company s underwriting performance but also render volatility to the company s bottom line  Notably  the property and casualty  P C  insurer expects to incur a loss of  516 million from the California wildfires Nonetheless  the results are anticipated to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance  reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015 Further  on the back of an improving interest rate environment  the company is likely to have witnessed investment income growth in the soon to be reported quarter The Zacks

an impact on the combined ratio Notably  the property and casualty  P C  insurer has projected a loss of not less than  1 million in each of the aforementioned catastrophe events Nonetheless  Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top line growth in the fourth quarter  fueled by higher premiums earned  This apart  a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives might have contributed to the possible upside On the back of a progressing interest rate environment  the company s net investment income is predicted to have significantly increased in the quarter to

31022,252537,GL,Torchmark Or Reinsurance Group  Which Stock Scores Better ,opinion,An improving economic backdrop  reflected by optimistic employment outlook  inflation approaching 2  and a growing GDP rate  is further testified by an increase in interest rate  The Fed has hiked rates six times since the financial crisis  of which  three were approved in 2017  The heightened pace clearly signals toward strengthening the U S  economy Recently  the Fed has raised the interest rate by 25 basis points  currently standing at 1 75  under the new chairman Jerome Powell  With three expected hikes in 2019 and two more in 2020  the interest rate is expected to reach 3 4  at 2020 end Life insurers are a major beneficiary of the improving rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rate  Though the life insurance companies have lowered exposure to interest sensitive product lines  redesigning and re pricing products  yet investment income forms a major component of the top line  Insurers reinvest premiums they receive from policy holders to pay future claims  An improving rate environment will favor better returns Also  the improving economy indicates more disposable income and hence people opting for more insurance coverages  will drive the premiums higher for life insurers  Fed officials project unemployment rate stay about 4 5  over the longer term The new tax rate effective January 2018 trims the tax burden by  1 5 trillion  A lower tax incidence will likely boost earnings The Life Insurance industry  currently ranked at  71  among top 30  of the  for 267 industries   has underperformed the S P 500 in a year  registering a gain of 5 2   The index has climbed 16 2    Here we focus on two life insurers namely Torchmark Corporation   NYSE TMK   and

intensive  critical illness and financial reinsurance services Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   It will be interesting to note which is better positioned in terms of fundamentals Investors

Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Price PerformanceBoth Torchmark and Reinsurance Group have outpaced the  in a year s time  While Reinsurance Group shares have rallied 27 6   the Torchmark stock has gained 10 2   Reinsurance Group emerges a clear winner here  ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers  Compared with the Life Insurance Industry s P B ratio of 2 13  Torchmark is underpriced with a reading of 1 56  Meanwhile  Reinsurance Group is way cheaper with a trailing 12 month P B multiple of 1 07  This round also goes to Reinsurance Group as the company s shares are cheaper than Torchmark s   Debt to EquityTorchmark s debt to equity ratio of 23 4 and that of Reinsurance Group at 29 1 are respectively higher than the industry average of 8 9  However  with a lower leverage  Torchmark scores more than Reinsurance Group in this round  Dividend Yield    Both Torchmark and Reinsurance Group have lower dividend yields compared with the industry average of 1 71   Reinsurance Group with an yield of 1 26  has an edge over Torchmark with the same of 0 71   Hence  Reinsurance Group has an edge over Torchmark on this front  Return on EquityTorchmark s return on equity of 10 81  is higher than the industry s average of 10 5  as well as Reinsurance Group s 8 6   Return on equity is a profitability measure  identifying how the company is effectively utilizing its shareholders  money  Comparatively  Torchmark betters Reinsurance Group here  Earnings Surprise HistoryWith respect to the companies  earnings surprise history  Torchmark has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 1 48   While Reinsurance Group has delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters

declined 0 3  for 2019 in the last 60 days   Whereas the consensus mark for Reinsurance Group has moved up 1 7  for 2018 and 1 3  for 2019 For Torchmark  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per

Reinsurance Group VGM ScoreHere V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors  Torchmark with an impressive  of B has a visible

31063,252578,GL,Is Torchmark Corp   TMK  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Torchmark Corporation   NYSE TMK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Torchmark Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the company is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 8 We should also point out that Torchmark Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 18 9  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Torchmark Corporation has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is much lower than the industry s average  which comes in at 2 7 right now If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Torchmark Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Torchmark Corporation a solid choice for value investors For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 5  which is better than the industry average of 12 1  Clearly  TMK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Torchmark Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C  This gives TMK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have rising  The current year consensus estimate has risen by 0 2  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has also inched up by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Torchmark Corporation Price and Consensus   The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Torchmark Corporation is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineTorchmark Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a good industry rank  Top 40  compared to over 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past year  its industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to grab the stock as it appears to be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ,2017-12-28,Zacks Investment

31083,252598,GL,Insurers To Endure A Hitch Before Tax Reform Gains,opinion,"The U S  Senate passed The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  marking President Donald Trump s first major legislative victory  The reform  which brings down the tax rate to 21  from 35   is anticipated to be an overall positive for the corporate sector 
Trump noted that such a bill is a  big  beautiful Christmas present  for families  while the White House press secretary said that  a simple  fair  and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy  and it s within our reach  
Notably  this biggest ever one time drop in business tax will likely be conducive to economic growth  However  insurers and companies in the finance sectors  such as banks  will have to endure some short term pain before enjoying the benefits 
Initial Impact Not So Glossy
The initial impact of tax reduction to be borne by companies in the insurance sector will be in the form of a write down in deferred tax assets  DTAs   This is also likely to a take a hit at their risk based capitalization levels 
DTAs arise when an insurer records an asset equal to the expected future amount of the tax deduction  because of the requirement to discount loss and unearned premium reserves   
Rating agency Standard   Poor s estimates that its rated U S  life insurers had about  35 billion of DTA on their statutory balance sheets as of Sep 30  2017 The new tax bill requires some insurers to write down DTAs to align their balance sheets to the new tax regime 
Per the S P  the reform will lead to an aggregate write down of about  14 billion of life insurers  DTA  representing 4  of statutory capital  Consequently  this will hit the capitalization levels of some insurers  Deterioration in Risk Based Capital at regulated subsidiaries would also impact subsidiaries  ability to pass on dividend capital to the holding company 
Reinsurer RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd    NYSE RNR   recently announced an estimated  40 million of reduction in its net income on account of DTAs write down 
MetLife  NYSE MET  estimates its RBC to be down by 65 basis points  Prudential Financial Inc    NYSE PRU   expects an around 100 point impact to the RBC at the PICA level  Torchmark  NYSE TMK  estimated a reduction of around 50 basis points on the assumption that the tax rate would go down to 25  but the magnitude of decline has been more than anticipated 
The S P also stated major changes from the tax bill to multinational entity taxation rules  Shift to a territorial tax system and the base erosion tax provisions will affect U S  insurers with international operations as well as foreign reinsurers with admitted domestic subsidiaries 
The rating agency expects some degree of repatriation of offshore retained profits to bring cash into the country  from foreign subsidiaries   Conversely  the increased excise tax may result in reinsurers and certain insurers  which use offshore reinsurance captives  adjusting their capital optimization strategies or product pricing due to the higher taxes 
Long Term More Attractive
While the near term impact on insurers is not all positive  the long term effects would definitely be more attractive  A lower tax rate would flow through the bottom line and aid margins directly  Apart from boosting margins  the tax rate reduction will also make U S insurers more competitive globally 
In addition to the above  the tax reform  which includes lower domestic tax rates on repatriation of income stashed offshore  will well serve foreign insurers that moved abroad the profit generated in the United States to avoid tax 
The bill looks like a major legislative achievement  having been supported widely by industry groups  The Coalition for American Insurance  which represents major U S  based insurance groups  Alleghany  The Allstate Corp    NYSE ALL    American Family  American Financial Group Inc   Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   Cincinnati Insurance  CAN  EMC  NYSE EMC  Insurance  Liberty Mutual  The Hartford  Travelers and W R  Berkley Corp   NYSE WRB    has also endorsed this historical reform Since the passage of this bill  the  has grown 0 2   outperforming the S P 500 s increase of 0 1  

 
Going Forward
The year 2017 had been an eventful one for insurers given huge catastrophe losses on the one hand and the tax reform on the other  We expect 2018 to be smooth for the players as they adjust to the new tax regime and ultimately reap the benefits of a lower tax rate

31151,252666,GL,U S  Insurance Stock Outlook   December 2017,opinion,"The Federal Reserve s latest rate interest rate increase and prospects of further hikes in 2018  with an improving economic outlook supported by the impending tax legislation  make the backdrop favorable for insurers  This is because insurers depend on rate sensitive instruments to invest the chunks of cash they typically hold to meet their commitments to policyholders  In fact  insurers are known to be one of the beneficiaries of a rising rate environment 
Moreover  while the expected continuation of a benign credit environment will support the operating performance of life insurers  a strong capital base will help Property   Casualty  P C  insurers combat losses from hurricanes   Harvey  Irma and Maria   and the wildfires in California 
However  the gradual improvement in interest rates so far have not drawn the attention of investors toward insurance stocks  This is clearly evident from the 10 7  gain of the SPDR S P Insurance ETF  NYSE KIE   which fairly represents the insurance industry versus the S P 500 s rally of 20 3  since the beginning of the year  In fact  the Zacks Insurance Industry has marginally underperformed the S P 500 over this period 
The reason behind this restrained reaction could be fading optimism of investors over the key interest rate reaching a level that actually benefits insurers  Investors are perhaps expecting only a little impact of this monetary policy tightening on the Treasury yield curve that insurers depend on for their investment income 
Moreover  as a number of industry participants  particularly life insurers  had reduced their exposure to underperforming interest sensitive businesses in a prolonged low rate environment  investors expect only a modest impact of higher rates on their financials 
In fact  concerns over unfavorable underwriting results  severity trends  market softening and regulatory uncertainty over the past few years have overshadowed the optimism surrounding monetary policy tightening 
Was the Low Rate Environment Too Big an Issue 
The performance of insurance stocks over the past five years doesn t show any noticeable weakness that the low rate could have caused  In fact  the industry performed better than the broader market during this period  indicating its ability to easily dodge the rate induced hindrances  The SPDR S P Insurance ETF gained 108 7  and the Zacks Insurance Industry rallied 87 1  in the past five years versus 89 2  growth of the S P 500 
How have insurers managed to perform so well  In the low rate era  many insurers changed their asset allocation strategies to minimize the impact of low rates on their business  Moving beyond their traditional holdings  they invested in racier asset classes for increased returns 
In fact  this has now reduced their ability to reap the benefits of rising rates  Of course  pricing changes and the eventual improvement in yields on high quality bonds based on rising rates will let them earn more  but their revenue model is now stable enough to counter a low rate environment 
Industry Looks Undervalued and Zacks Rank Indicates Outperformance
While the industry performed almost in line with the broader market over the last five years  there is a value oriented path ahead  Looking at the industry s price to book ratio  which is the best multiple for valuing insurers because of their unpredictable financial results  investors might still want to pay more  The Zacks Insurance Industry currently has a trailing 12 month P B ratio of 2 65  This compares unfavorably with the average level of 2 25 seen by the industry in the last five years  However  it compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the current P B for the S P 500 is at 3 8 and the median level is 3 2 
Overall  while the valuation from a P B perspective looks stretched when compared with its own range in the time period  its lower than market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead 
Moreover  the group s  indicates outperformance for all segments  Per the Zacks classification  the industry is sub divided into five industries at the expanded  aka  X   level  Property   Casualty Insurance  Multiline Insurance  Accident   Health Insurance  Life Insurance and Insurance Brokers 
The Zacks Industry Rank is  12  top 5  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  for Accident   Health   56  top 22   for Life   109  top 43   for Property   Casualty   115  top 45   for both Brokers and Multiline  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  Rising Rates to Benefit the Industry Partially
Being structurally tied to interest rates  monetary policy tightening has started benefiting the industry  But the extent of benefits varies across industry segments  A lot depends on how interest rates change going forward 
Property   Casualty insurance  which is not too sensitive to the interest rate environment  holds a significant amount of bonds  which would fall in value with interest rates rising steadily going forward  which is likely   This will lead to capital volatility in the industry 
However  the rising rate environment would keep easing the pressure on P C insurers  investment income  and thus their earnings  Moreover  a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive  further supporting carriers to grow 
Life insurers depend heavily on investment income  so they will benefit more from the rising rate environment  There will be relief from operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for long  However  the benefit is expected to be modest as life insurers had significantly reduced their interest sensitive product lines in the low rate era 
No matter how the changing interest rate environment impacts insurers  continued influx of capital is expected to keep most lines of P C insurance favorable for buyers   expect personal lines that might experience higher premium rates due to the recent catastrophe losses  On the other hand  containment of underwriting expenses and a modest increase in premiums are shoring up the prospects of life insurers  With a glaring dissimilarity in business dynamics  it makes better sense to look at the prospects of these two key segments of the U S  insurance space separately  read our subsequent posts for a detailed insight  
Factors Beyond Rising Rates to Determine Fate of Insurers
Domestic economic progress makes the backdrop stronger for the country s insurers  After all  a strong job market and boosted consumer sentiment  along with a moderately growing homeownership rate  will lead to more personal property buying  which means more insurable exposure 
Moreover  any fluctuation in the U S  dollar will not have much impact on the industry  as it drives the majority of revenues from the domestic economy 
Evolving insurable risks  such as cyber threats  endemic diseases  etc   should increase demand for coverage  In fact  higher demand from the economically recuperating American households should eventually place insurers in a favorable pricing cycle 
Premium rates for auto insurance  which have risen over the last couple of years due to increasing accident frequency and severity trends  will reduce to some extent with the growing adoption of accident avoidance technologies 
A strong liquidity profile by virtue of continued capital inflow into the industry  ample capacity  conservative product design and evolving coverage will not only limit any downside but will also keep the industry s growth trend alive 
However  increasing dependence on automation will gradually reduce the number of insurable workers across industries 
Bottom Line
Looking at the broader trends  the industry is unlikely to benefit significantly from raising interest rates  but that may not stop it from growing  While growth may be dampened to some extent if new issues crop up  insurers are capable enough of remaining profitable through underlying strength and business modification 
However  it may not be easy for insurers to allure investors  While there are enough drivers for margin expansion despite the damage caused by successive hurricanes  the inability to increase premium rates will keep on curbing profitability

from operating pressures resulting from tight credit spreads that the low rate environment has exerted for long  However  the benefit is expected to be modest as life insurers had significantly reduced their interest sensitive product lines in the low rate era No matter how the changing interest rate environment impacts insurers  continued influx of capital is expected to keep most lines of P C insurance favorable for buyers   expect personal lines that might experience higher premium rates due to the recent catastrophe losses  On the other hand  containment of underwriting expenses and a modest increase in premiums are shoring up the prospects of life insurers With a glaring dissimilarity in business dynamics  it makes better sense to look at the prospects of these two key segments of the U S  insurance space separately  read our subsequent posts for a detailed insight  Factors Beyond Rising Rates to Determine Fate of InsurersDomestic economic progress makes the backdrop stronger for the country s insurers  After all  a strong job market and boosted consumer sentiment  along with a moderately growing homeownership rate  will lead to more personal property buying  which means more insurable exposure Moreover  any fluctuation in the U S  dollar will not have much impact on the industry  as it drives the majority of revenues from the domestic economy Evolving insurable risks  such as cyber threats  endemic diseases  etc   should increase demand for coverage  In fact  higher demand from the economically recuperating American households should eventually place insurers in a favorable pricing cycle Premium rates for auto insurance  which have risen over the last couple of years due to increasing accident frequency and severity trends  will reduce to some extent with the growing adoption of accident avoidance technologies A strong liquidity profile by virtue of continued capital inflow into the industry  ample capacity  conservative product design and evolving coverage will not only limit any downside but will also keep the industry s growth trend alive However  increasing dependence on automation will gradually reduce the number of insurable workers across industries Bottom LineLooking at the broader trends  the industry is unlikely to benefit significantly from raising interest rates  but that may not stop it from growing  While growth may be dampened to some extent if new issues crop up  insurers are capable enough of remaining profitable through underlying strength and business modification However  it may not be easy for insurers to allure investors  While there are enough drivers for margin expansion despite the damage caused by successive hurricanes  the inability to increase premium rates will keep on curbing profitability

5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Ensure Safe Returns

	Honing in on dividend is a tried and true practice during market turbulence  These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk  In particular  stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pays high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation 

Why is Dividend Growth Better 

	Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts 
	These stocks pose a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth a promising investment as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely  This makes the portfolio healthy and safe 
	Furthermore  these have a long history of outperformance over the long term  However  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields 
	Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero   This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero   This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero   This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero   This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight    This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank   Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment VGM  of B or better   This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum  This when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 offers the best upside potential 
	Here are five of the 19 stocks that fit the bill MKS Instruments  Inc   NASDAQ        This Massachusetts based company is a leading worldwide developer  manufacturer and supplier of instruments  components and subsystems used to measure  control and analyze gases in semiconductor manufacturing and similar industrial manufacturing processes  The company has seen strong earnings estimate revision of  1 00 over the past 90 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 63 83   It has a VGM Style Score of B and sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   Hasbro Inc   NASDAQ        This Rhode Island based company is a worldwide leader in children s and family leisure time and entertainment products and services  including the design  manufacture and marketing of games and toys ranging from traditional to high tech  It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 22 cents for this year over the past three months  with an expected earnings growth rate of 9 87   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of A Torchmark Corporation  NYSE        This Texas based financial services holding company specializes in life and supplemental health insurance for middle income Americans  The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2 01  in the past four quarters and has an earnings growth rate of 3 04  for this year  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 with a VGM Style Score of B GATX Corporation  NYSE        This Illinois based company is the leading global railcar lessor specializing in railcar and locomotive operating leasing  aircraft operating leasing  information technology leasing  and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide  It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of a nickel for this year over the past three months  and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 32 81  in the past four quarters  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of B Anthem Inc   NYSE        This Indiana based company operates as a health benefits company in the United States  The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revision of 25 cents over the past 90 days for this year with an expected earnings growth rate of 6 93   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of A

31198,252713,GL,Insurance Stock Q2 Earnings Due On Jul 26  XL  TMK   More,opinion,The second quarter earnings season has rolled out with 19  members of the elite S P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far  Per the latest   the performance of 97 index members  accounting for 28 1  of index s total market capitalization  that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter  indicate that total earnings have increased 8 4  on 5 1  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 78 4  companies surpassing the bottom line expectations and 72 2  outperforming on the top line front The Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has delivered a strong performance so far  53 3  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index that have reported quarterly results shows 7 2  earnings growth on 5 4  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The beat ratio of 81 1  for the bottom line and 66 7  for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S P 500   The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses  which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers  Per Aon Benfield  the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc   NYSE AON    catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at  53 billion in the first half of 2017   Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U S The Allstate Corp    NYSE ALL   projects  638 million in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation   NYSE KMPR   estimates the same between  32 million and  38 million Nonetheless  prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment  Net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  has witnessed improvement  albeit far lower than the historical highs  The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates  reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions  The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters  An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates  Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates  Nonetheless  life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest sensitive product lines Also  improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment  This in turn  is likely to have supported more policy writings  driving premiums higher  which contribute a lion s share in an insurers  top line On the flip side  we do not expect pricings to have been strong  To write new business and retain renewals  insurers have been easing pricing  leading to soft pricing   Commercial property  workers  compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing Nonetheless  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers This week will see more than 800 companies reporting their quarterly results  including 183 S P 500 members Let s find out how these four insurers might perform when they release their quarterly numbers on Jul 26 XL Group plc   NYSE XL   is

Consensus Estimate of  2 40 by 10   Moreover  the bottom line deteriorated 7 3  year over year  The year over year decline in earnings can be attributed to lower net favorable prior year reserve

 due to a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development  This  in turn  may be attributed to a  51 million after tax increase in reserves related to the Ogden discount rate adjustment as

Today s Featured Research Reports
GE shares have struggled over the past year on concerns about the conglomerate s long term earnings power and the issues aren t going away in response to Friday s seemingly better than expected quarterly report  The company beat EPS and revenue estimates and came out with improved industrial margins and backlog  But cash flow measures were on the weak side  highlighting once again issues of earnings quality   On the positive side  management reiterated guidance for 2017 and expects a steady rise in operating profits with a healthy ROI from the Alstom  PA ALSO  deal and the accretive Baker Hughes transaction  General Electric further aims to grow its 3D manufacturing business to  1 billion by 2020 through opportune acquisitions  To that end  it is enjoying strong momentum in the power and aviation end markets  partly offset by continued weakness in the energy space   You can  
Bank of America shares have lost ground since the market s March 1st peak on policy uncertainty and downtrend in treasury yields  But the stock has turned around in recent days  with the strong Q1 earnings report helping sentiment as well  The stock is down  7 9  since March 1st vs   1 9  decline for the S P 500  but is still up  6 3  in the year to date period vs   5  for the index  The company s efforts to streamline and simplify operations continue to enhance efficiency  narrowing the gap with its peers  But the stock s near term performance will likely continue to reflect macro developments on the interest rate and fiscal policy fronts   You can  
UnitedHealth shares were up big on last week s strong quarterly report when it beat on the top  and bottom lines and guided higher on the back of positive momentum in its Health Care and Optum segments  This Buy rated stock was lagging the S P 500 index prior to the earnings release  but has clearly broken out to the upside since then   it is up now  7 5  in the year to date period vs   4 9  gain for the index  The Zacks analyst likes that fact that the company is consistently gaining from the Medicaid and Medicare businesses  Continued growth at Optum is also creating a diversified revenue source  Also  UnitedHealth should benefit from its capital strength and niche market position  But losses on public exchange business and higher operating costs are some of the headwinds   You can  
Philip Morris International s Q1 results lagged estimates on a bigger than expected volume drop  particularly at the low end of the market  Many analysts see the market share loss in Q1 as in line with management s  premium ization  strategy and don t see it as cause for concern  but it nevertheless merits monitoring over the next few quarters  particularly given the stock s recent outperformance  PM is up  20 2  in the year to date period vs   13  for the industry and  4 1  for the S P 500 index   The stock has historically been a defensive dividend play  current yield an attractive 3 8    but its recent performance puts it in an altogether category  Driving this momentum has been the company s improved operating outlook and expectations of greater consolidation in the space  Market participants likely need to be mindful of valuation questions as well given the stock s impressive run up  particularly in a backdrop of unfavorable currencies  all of PM s revenues come from beyond the U S   and market share concerns following the Q1 shortfall   You can

31339,252854,GL,Should Value Investors Pick Torchmark Corporation  TMK  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Torchmark Corporation   NYSE TMK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Torchmark Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Torchmark Corporation s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Insurance   Life industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 9 We should also point out that Torchmark Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 35  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Torchmark Corporation stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Torchmark Corporation has a P S ratio of about 2 3  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Torchmark Corporation s P CF ratio of 9 is lower than the Zacks classified Insurance   Life industry average of 17 5  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Torchmark Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Torchmark Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Torchmark Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives TMK a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have rising  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and none down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 0 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Torchmark Corporation Price and Consensus
    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Bottom LineTorchmark Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  with a good industry rank  Top 14  compared to over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2  it is hard to not get excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past year  the Zacks Insurance   Life industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to grab the stock as it appears to be a compelling pick Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth ",2017-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-torchmark-corporation-(tmk)-200187726,200187726

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Solid Dividend Growth Stocks to Counter Choppy Markets 

No doubt  dividends are always the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from price movements of stocks are at risk  In particular  stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pays high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation 

Why Dividend Growth 

Stocks that have a history of enhancing shareholder returns generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty or stock market volatility 
	Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals compared to other dividend paying stocks as dividend growth poses a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  All these make dividend growth a promising investment amid market turbulence 
	Further  these are proven outperformers over the long term despite the fact that they do not necessarily have the highest yields 
	Hence  to find stocks with a solid dividend growth history  we have focused on 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth of more than zero  The combination of this metric with other exciting parameters could result in a winning portfolio Other Parameters Most Recent Payout Ratio less than M Industry  This is the measure of dividend payments as a percentage of earnings  A relatively low payout ratio indicates the company s ability to increase dividend in the future even in tough times 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a strong record of revenue growth 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero    This shortlists stocks with a solid earnings growth history 

Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Zacks Rank Less than 3  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3  Hold  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment VGM      of B or better  This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum Market Capitalization greater than  2 billion  We have eliminated small cap stocks to ensure better flexibility and tradability 
	Here are five of the 16 stocks that fit the bill Tyson Foods Inc         This Arkansas based company is one of the world s largest producers of chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods  offering a wide range of protein based and prepared food products  It saw positive earnings estimate revisions of a couple of cents for fiscal 2016 over the past 30 days  with an expected above average growth rate of 37 54   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of A Lear Corporation      This Michigan based company is a global leader in designing  developing  engineering  manufacturing  assembling  and supplying automotive seating  electrical distribution systems  and related components primarily to automotive original equipment manufacturers worldwide  The stock has an above industry earnings growth rate of 19 69  for this year  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Style Score of A Torchmark Corporation      This is a Texas based financial services holding company specializing in life and supplemental health insurance for middle income Americans  Its earnings are expected to growth at rate of 5 46  for this year  The stock has a Zacks Rank  3 and a VGM Style Score of A Lexington Realty Trust      This New York City based company is a real estate investment trust engaged in the ownership  operation and management of a diverse portfolio of real properties  The stock saw earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year over the past 30 days and delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7 59  over the past four quarters  It has a Zacks Rank  3 and a VGM Style Score of B DTE Energy Company      This Michigan based company is a diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy related businesses and services nationwide  Its earnings are expected to growth at rate of 2 70  for this year  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of B

4 Insurance Stocks to Buy Before a Rate Hike

Will the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  make any positive change to the interest rate in the meeting scheduled on Jun 15  While this is anybody s guess  the Fed decision is being eagerly waited for 

When everyone predicted an increase in the rate in the Sep 2015 FOMC meeting  the Fed decided against it  However  after a period of prolonged near zero interest rate  the Fed chose to raise the rates to only 0 25 0 50  at its December meeting  While the federal funds rate was kept the same at the Mar 2016 meeting  uncertainties over further rate hikes were removed  In fact  the Fed lowered the median forecast for the number of rate hikes this year to two from four projected at its meeting last December 
	Nevertheless  the rate environment is still low  But comments from St  Louis Fed President James Bullard is definitely drawing attention  In an interview to CNBC  Bullard said   A U S  Federal Reserve rate hike in June or July wasn t set in stone  but labor data suggested it was time to pull the trigger   As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  total nonfarm payroll employment in April increased by nearly 0 2 million while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5   Other factors that might act as gunpowder are the easing of the U S  dollar  momentum in oil prices and inflation approaching 2  as noted by Eric Rosengren  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston 
	It is to be noted that the June meeting will be before the U S  presidential election and will thus attract eyeballs  However  James Bullard does not think that the election will have any impact on the Fed s decision of hiking rates 
	Interest rate directly impacts the investment results of a company  For insurance companies  investment income forms a major revenue component  A low rate puts pressure on investment income and in turn on investment yields  Life insurers  in particular  suffer spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to sustained low rates  Hence any increase in the interest rate would bring some respite for insurers 
	But it s not that a low interest rate regime does not bring any fortunes for insurance companies  These generally hold a considerable amount in bonds  which would see a decline in value if rates rise 
	So since insurance stocks are poised for growth no matter what the Fed chooses to do  the space is bound to attract attention  We have picked four solid operators in the space that have the potential to boost one s portfolio even more  We refined our search using the   a favorable Zacks Rank  attractive price to earnings  P E  and positive estimate revisions  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores 4 Stocks with Winning Potential

31429,252944,GL,Torchmark s Growth Initiatives Impress  High Expenses A Drag,opinion,On Jun 3  we issued an updated research report on Torchmark Corporation   NYSE TMK   In the first quarter of 2016  the insurer s operating earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by higher premiums from both life and health insurance segments  The company s underwriting income improved as well  The improvement in premiums is primarily attributable to distribution channels   American Income Agency and Direct Response  Although higher administrative expenses might limit bottom line growth  the company remains committed to improve through its niche market focus and steady operations  Going by the surprise trend  Torchmark delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters Torchmark has been able to deliver a robust performance on the back of new initiatives in its highly focused market segment  Higher premiums from American Income Exclusive Agency distribution channel have made the company focused on further expanding sales through this channel  To increase agent count and improve efficiency  Torchmark has also introduced several development and training programs for agents and management  The Global Life segment too has been delivering good results with higher premiums as it enjoys a dominant presence in a market with low competition  The company expects the 2012 buyout Family Heritage to start paying off in the current year with higher margins and growth of 2 6   The company s efficient capital management supports its initiatives Torchmark has been consistent in creating value for shareholders  In alignment with its share buyback program  the company repurchased 1 5 million shares worth  80 million in the first quarter  However  the company s high administrative expenses and low investment income are headwinds  Performance of Torchmark s third primary distribution system Liberty National has also been weak  This channel has so far been unable to produce desired results and its growth options remain marginal  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  4 44 per share for 2016 and  4 78 for 2017  This indicates a year over year increase of 5 46  in 2016 and 7 69  in 2017 Currently  the insurer carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the insurance industry include Health Insurance Innovations  Inc    NASDAQ HIIQ   and Manulife Financial Corporation   NYSE MFC   with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Sun Life Financial Inc   TO SLF   with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-06-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/torchmark's-growth-initiatives-impress,-high-expenses-a-drag-200133859",200133859
31430,252945,GL,The Best And Worst Of The Mid Cap Blend Style 2Q16,opinion,"The Mid Cap Blend style ranks fifth out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in our  report    the Mid Cap Blend style ranked sixth  It gets our Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 20 ETFs and 377 mutual funds in the Mid Cap Blend style as of May 4  2016  See a recap of our 
Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style  Not all Mid Cap Blend style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 14 to 3281   This variation creates drastically different investment implications and  therefore  ratings 
Investors seeking exposure to the Mid Cap Blend style should buy one of the Attractive or better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2 
Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5

  Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNAs less than  100 million for inadequate liquidity 
Five ETFs are excluded from Figure 1 because total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums  See our  for more details 
Figure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best and Worst Ratings   Top 5

  Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than  100 million for inadequate liquidity 
Five mutual funds are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums  See our  for more details 
PowerShares S P MidCap Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE XMLV  is the top rated Mid Cap Blend ETF and Invesco Mid Cap Core Equity Fund  GTAFX  is the top rated Mid Cap Blend mutual fund  XMLV earns a Neutral rating and GTAFX earns an Attractive rating 
Guggenheim Raymond James SB 1 Equity ETF  NYSE RYJ  is the worst rated Mid Cap Blend ETF and RBC Mid Cap Value Fund  RBMAX  is the worst rated Mid Cap Blend mutual fund  RYJ earns a Dangerous rating and RBMAX earns a Very Dangerous rating 
Torchmark Corporation  NYSE TMK   58 share  is one of our favorite stocks held by GTAFX and earns an Attractive rating  Torchmark may not be flashy  but it has been consistent in growing profits  Since 1998  Torchmark has grown after tax profit    by 4  compounded annually  The company has earned a double digit return on invested capital    every year since 1998 and currently earns a 13  ROIC 
Torchmark has also generated positive  in 17 of the past 18 years with a cumulative  3 billion over the last five years alone  Despite this operational success  TMK remains undervalued  At its current price of  58 share  Torchmark has a price to economic book value    ratio of 1 0 
This ratio means that the market expects Torchmark s NOPAT never to meaningfully grow from its current levels  If Torchmark can   the stock is worth  73 share today   a 26  upside 
United States Cellular Corp  NYSE USM   43 share  is one of our least favorite stocks held by RYJ and earns a Dangerous rating  Since 2006  United States Cellular s NOPAT has declined by 4  compounded annually  Its ROIC has fallen from an already low 5  in 2006 to a bottom quintile 2  over the last twelve months 
Worst of all  USM has never generated positive  in any year of our model  which dates to 1998  The market has ignored the deterioration of the business and USM is overvalued  To justify its current price  United States Cellular must   Given years of profit decline  this expectation seems overly optimistic 
Figures 3 and 4 show the rating landscape of all Mid Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds
