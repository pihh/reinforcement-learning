32552,254067,BPFH,Trump s Fed nominee has history of benefiting from bailouts,news,"By Olivia Oran and Pete Schroeder  Reuters    President Donald Trump s pick to lead bank supervision at the Federal Reserve benefited from the government bailing out or rescuing two banks during the 2008 financial crisis  but that may not prevent his confirmation by a U S  Senate controlled by a business friendly Republican party  policy analysts told Reuters in recent days  Randal Quarles  a former Wall Street lawyer and U S  Treasury official who now runs an investment firm  was part of a team that invested in troubled or failed banks while he was an executive at private equity firm  Carlyle Group  LP  O CG   Those investments earned hundreds of millions of dollars for Carlyle  profits that would not have been possible without government support  A spokesman for Quarles did not respond to a request for comment  A spokesman for Carlyle declined to comment  Democrats including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown have said they intend to scrutinize Quarles  ties to Wall Street during his confirmation hearing  Senator Elizabeth Warren described him as  straight off the Wall Street assembly line  in announcing her opposition in a statement  But both the White House and Congress are controlled by Republicans  who have the ability to approve Trump s nominees with a simple majority after Senate rules were changed in 2013  Under previous rules  the party in power would have needed at least 60 votes  Quarles is viewed by many policy analysts as a business friendly pick who benefits from having experience in the federal government and his business ties are unlikely to be viewed by senior senators his Wall Street ties as a handicap    Profiting in the markets isn t a scarlet letter in this Congress   said Isaac Boltansky  director of policy research at Compass Point Trading   Research LLC  in Washington  Before launching The Cynosure Group in 2014  Quarles was a partner and managing director at Carlyle  While there  he played a key role in making a  75 million investment in Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc  O BPFH   and was also part of a group that decided to jointly acquire failed lender  BankUnited Inc   N BKU  from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  FDIC   alongside private equity peers Blackstone Group LP  N BX   Centerbridge Partners LP and WL Ross   Co  as well as banker John Kanas  Months after Carlyle s equity infusion  Boston Private received a  150 million bailout from the Treasury Department  which it later repaid  Those taxpayer funds helped the firm weather the financial crisis  and allowed Carlyle to sell off its stake over time for a total of  150 million  effectively doubling its money  according to a Reuters review of share sales the firm disclosed in regulatory filings  The FDIC had absorbed BankUnited s losses at an estimated cost of  4 9 billion before selling healthier assets to the private equity consortium for  945 million  BankUnited later went public  with Carlyle selling shares worth around  428 million in portions through 2014  according to Reuters  analysis of its disclosures  The tallies do not account for dividends or other undisclosed costs  Carlyle would not provide precise numbers for returns on those investments  Involvement with taxpayer bailouts helped sink the earlier nomination of  General Electric  Co  N GE  executive David Nason for the Federal Reserve supervisory position  Nason withdrew from vetting after Republicans criticized him for having structured the bailout program inside the Treasury Department during the Bush administration  But Wilbur Ross  whose WL Ross   Co was part of the consortium that invested in BankUnited alongside Carlyle  successfully became U S  Commerce Secretary  Quarles  history on Wall Street may be a talking point during his confirmation hearings  but it is unlikely to bring down his nomination  lobbyists and financial regulatory lawyers said

32569,254084,BPFH,Is Boston Private  BPFH  A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Boston Private Financial Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ BPFH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Boston Private has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 84  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 43  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Boston Private s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 64 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 62  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Boston Private has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 16  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Boston Private has a P S ratio of about 2 28  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 25x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Boston Private currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Boston Private a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 75  which is far better than the industry average of 11 45  Clearly  BPFH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Boston Private might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of A  This gives BPFH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been solid at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 4 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Boston Private Financial Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat bullish trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBoston Private is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 17  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Banks  Northeast industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys

country s real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2 1   second estimate   In the second quarter  it was 2 0   while in the first quarter real GDP was 3 1   Thus  economic growth along with lower tax

susceptible to global concerns Moreover  the small cap stock market rally is expected to continue going forward  given the recent optimism over trade talks  It is expected that small cap companies may
