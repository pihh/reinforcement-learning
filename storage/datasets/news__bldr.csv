114128,335643,BLDR,Can Value Investors Pick Builders FirstSource  BLDR  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Builders FirstSource  Inc    NASDAQ BLDR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Builders FirstSource has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 23  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 47  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Builders FirstSource s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13 93 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 29 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Builders FirstSource has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 01  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Builders FirstSource stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Builders FirstSource has a P S ratio of about 0 42  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 54x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Builders FirstSource currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Builders FirstSource a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 28  which is far better than the industry average of 9 82  Clearly  BLDR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Builders FirstSource might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F  This gives BLDR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been decent at best  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen one up and none down in the same time period  This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 3 6  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 1 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Builders FirstSource  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineBuilders FirstSource is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 27  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Building Products   Retail industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor

Company   NYSE BCC   5 Attractive Stocks Post Recent Broker Rating UpgradesThe third quarter earnings season  which is in its last leg  has so far been impressive with many companies reporting better than expected earnings per share  The latest  showed that more than 92  of the S P 500 companies posted respective financial numbers with 72 7  beating on the bottom line Generally  a company s earnings beat leads to share price appreciation  Given this highly bullish backdrop  investors would like to add some outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns However  this task seems daunting with a plethora of companies crowding the market  Moreover  the complexities associated with the stock market make it even more difficult for individual investors to pick profitable stocks for their portfolios in absence of proper guidance Pay Attention to Broker AdviceThe requisite guidance to design a winning portfolio comes from brokers  The opinion of brokers is highly sought after by investors as they have a clear insight into the complications of the investment world  Consequently  it makes sense for individual investors to be guided by broker advice in order to design a promising portfolio as investors generally do not have access to such detailed and well researched information Brokers revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned stock  Naturally  their stock related actions  upgrade or downgrade  serve as an invaluable guide as far as fixing the target stock  s  price is concerned Estimates can move north for a number of reasons  such as favorable earnings performance  a bullish outlook  product launch or any positive macro scenario  Similarly  lackluster earnings often cause stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be led by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks What About Revenues While we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  Therefore  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio that serves as a strong complementary valuation metric For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at Disclosure  Officers  directors and

114212,335727,BLDR,5 Attractive Stocks Post Recent Broker Rating Upgrades,opinion,The third quarter earnings season  which is in its last leg  has so far been impressive with many companies reporting better than expected earnings per share  The latest  showed that more than 92  of the S P 500 companies posted respective financial numbers with 72 7  beating on the bottom line Generally  a company s earnings beat leads to share price appreciation  Given this highly bullish backdrop  investors would like to add some outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns However  this task seems daunting with a plethora of companies crowding the market  Moreover  the complexities associated with the stock market make it even more difficult for individual investors to pick profitable stocks for their portfolios in absence of proper guidance Pay Attention to Broker AdviceThe requisite guidance to design a winning portfolio comes from brokers  The opinion of brokers is highly sought after by investors as they have a clear insight into the complications of the investment world  Consequently  it makes sense for individual investors to be guided by broker advice in order to design a promising portfolio as investors generally do not have access to such detailed and well researched information Brokers revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned stock  Naturally  their stock related actions  upgrade or downgrade  serve as an invaluable guide as far as fixing the target stock  s  price is concerned Estimates can move north for a number of reasons  such as favorable earnings performance  a bullish outlook  product launch or any positive macro scenario  Similarly  lackluster earnings often cause stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be led by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks What About Revenues While we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top

BLDR Valuation Provides Significant Upside Potential
At its current price of  19 share  BLDR has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means the market expects BLDR s NOPAT to permanently decline by 10   This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 10  compounded annually since 2016 If BLDR can maintain TTM NOPAT margins  4   and grow NOPAT by just 3  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  32 share today   a 66  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario

XRAY Provides Poor Risk Reward
Despite the deterioration in fundamentals  XRAY is priced for significant profit growth To justify its current price of  53 share  XRAY must achieve its 2016 NOPAT margins of 14   compared to 7  TTM  and grow NOPAT by 9  compounded annually for the next 10 years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario  This expectation seems overly optimistic given that XRAY s NOPAT has grown by just 1  compounded annually over the past decade  which has been the longest economic expansion in US history  Even if XRAY can maintain 2018 margins of 9  and grow NOPAT by 5  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  30 share today   a 44  downside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario

114252,335767,BLDR,Housing ETFs   Stocks To Buy On Likely September Rate Cut ,opinion,"It seems the tiding is going to be great for the housing market  One market  that permit the Fed to  take preemptive action here and cut interest rates  
At the current level  according to CME FedWatch tool  there is an 88 8  chance of a 25 bp rate cut in the Sep 18 meeting  followed by an 11 2  probability of a no rate cut scenario  As of Aug 22  2019  the benchmark U S  treasury yield was 1 62  versus 2 66  noted in Jan 2019 
Since low interest rates are beneficial for homebuilding stocks and ETFs  investors can definitely bet on the space right now  In any case  the segment is showing promise both operationally and stock price wise 
Sales of existing homes in the United States rose 2 5  from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 42 million in July 2019  higher than market expectations of 5 39 million  Existing home sales make up about 90  of U S  home sales 
But sales for the prior three months were lowered  While overall sales witnessed a spurt in June  the West was responsible for most of the gains  where sales surged 50 4   Lower mortgage rates led to gains in the housing sector 
Unlike last year  the Fed has been pretty dovish from the start of this year  The central bank has pledged to take a patient stance toward the future rate outlook amid global growth worries  The Fed has also enacted a rate cut this year  Buyers will be trying to dip their toes into the housing market for as long as the rates remain affordable  A solid job market is doing its bit to drive this segment  This is why despite persistently low inventories and rising price issues  the latest pool of sales data came in favorable 
July s increase made existing home sales  higher than they were a year earlier for the first time in 17 months   The U S  home market started struggling from last year due to the Fed s continued rate hiking spree  However  the central bank enacted its first rate cut in July since 2008  in order to keep chances of a U S  recession at bay 
The 30 year fixed mortgage rate declined to an average of 3 77  in July from more than a seven year peak of 4 94  in November  according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac  as quoted on CNBC  The average rate dropped to 3 6  in the Aug 15 week and there are cues that the Fed may cut rates in September due to concerns about economic slowdown   
However  pressure on inventory and rising prices are bothering the space  There were 1 89 million previously owned homes on the market in July  down from 1 92 million in June and a 1 6  decrease from July 2018  The median existing house price increased 4 3  from a year ago to  280 800 in July 
At July s sales pace  it would take 4 2 months to clean up the current inventory  down from 4 4 months in June   A six to seven month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand    
Against this backdrop  below we highlight a few stocks and ETFs that could be in focus in the coming days

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Stocks to Gain from Upcoming Housing RecoveryIn more disappointing news for the housing sector  U S  housing starts declined in May  Moreover  the National Association of Home Builders   NAHB  home builder confidence index declined for the first time this year in June  However  both reports should not be taken at face value  since there is enough evidence in them to suggest that the housing sector is poised for a rebound First  housing starts for March and April have been revised upward  Meanwhile  building permits have increased  indicating that the sector is gaining from the strong decline in mortgage rates Further  last month s dip in homebuilder confidence is largely attributable to the fear of fresh tariffs on Mexican imports  a threat which no longer exists  Also  the sector is set to gain from rate cuts rates to occur later this year  This is why it is prudent to invest in stocks set to gain from the upcoming housing rebound Building Permits  Starts for March   April RiseIn May  housing starts declined by 0 9  to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 269 million units  However  the figure is considerably higher than the estimated level of 1 235 million units  Last month s decline was primarily attributable to a 6 4  plunge in single family homebuilding  The metric  which makes up most of the housing market  declined to 820 000 units However  a large part of the decline is attributable to torrential rain and significant flooding in several parts of the United States  Meanwhile  building permits advanced 0 3  to 1 294 million units  marking the second straight monthly increase Further  permits for single family homes increased for the first time in five months  The metric increased 3 7  to a pace of 815 000 units  posting a 7 7  increase in the South   the largest since December 2016  Gains for this forward looking indicator imply that better times are coming for the sector Housing Market Sentiment Surges  Mortgage Rates SlideIn June  the NAHB home builder confidence index declined by 2 points to 64  The decline was largely attributable to the specter of fresh tariffs on Mexican imports  This is why the decline is likely a one off event   The index has remained in the low  to mid sixties  a considerably high level  till now this year and May s was the highest reading since October 2018 Meanwhile  independent research firm Pulsenomics  Housing Confidence Index hit a five year high of 71 65 in the first quarter  According to the firm s founder  Terry Loebs  this is attributable to improving wage growth and lower mortgage rates  The U S  10 year note s yield  which is tracked by fixed rate mortgages  has plunged this year  a major positive for potential homeowners Our ChoicesDespite the decline in housing starts for May  the housing sector seems set for a rebound over the next few months  This is borne out by the increase in building permits  particularly for single family homes  Steady wage gains and low mortgage rates are helping to attract several prospective homeowners into the housing market This is why it makes sense to invest in stocks set to gain from the coming rebound in housing  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our VGM Score comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the

114287,335802,BLDR,Is Builders FirstSource  BLDR  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Builders FirstSource  Inc    NASDAQ BLDR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Builders FirstSource has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 13  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 39  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Builders FirstSource s current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint  which is 12 69  over the past three years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 01  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Builders FirstSource has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 67  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Builders FirstSource has a P S ratio of about 0 25  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 32 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Builders FirstSource currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BLDR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 79  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 7 87  Clearly  BLDR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Builders FirstSource might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives BLDR a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current year consensus estimate has risen 1 8  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has increased 3 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Builders FirstSource  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term   Bottom LineBuilders FirstSource is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its top Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  bottom 40  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop

114318,335833,BLDR,5 Stocks To Gain From The Upcoming Housing Recovery ,opinion,In more disappointing news for the housing sector  U S  housing starts declined in May  Moreover  the National Association of Home Builders   NAHB  home builder confidence index declined for the first time this year in June  However  both reports should not be taken at face value  since there is enough evidence in them to suggest that the housing sector is poised for a rebound First  housing starts for March and April have been revised upward  Meanwhile  building permits have increased  indicating that the sector is gaining from the strong decline in mortgage rates Further  last month s dip in homebuilder confidence is largely attributable to the fear of fresh tariffs on Mexican imports  a threat which no longer exists  Also  the sector is set to gain from rate cuts rates to occur later this year  This is why it is prudent to invest in stocks set to gain from the upcoming housing rebound Building Permits  Starts for March   April RiseIn May  housing starts declined by 0 9  to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 269 million units  However  the figure is considerably higher than the estimated level of 1 235 million units  Last month s decline was primarily attributable to a 6 4  plunge in single family homebuilding  The metric  which makes up most of the housing market  declined to 820 000 units However  a large part of the decline is attributable to torrential rain and significant flooding in several parts of the United States  Meanwhile  building permits advanced 0 3  to 1 294 million units  marking the second straight monthly increase Further  permits for single family homes increased for the first time in five months  The metric increased 3 7  to a pace of 815 000 units  posting a 7 7  increase in the South   the largest since December 2016  Gains for this forward looking indicator imply that better times are coming for the sector Housing Market Sentiment Surges  Mortgage Rates SlideIn June  the NAHB home builder confidence index declined by 2 points to 64  The decline was largely attributable to the specter of fresh tariffs on Mexican imports  This is why the decline is likely a one off event   The index has remained in the low  to mid sixties  a considerably high level  till now this year and May s was the highest reading since October 2018 Meanwhile  independent research firm Pulsenomics  Housing Confidence Index hit a five year high of 71 65 in the first quarter  According to the firm s founder  Terry Loebs  this is attributable to improving wage growth and lower mortgage rates  The U S  10 year note s yield  which is tracked by fixed rate mortgages  has plunged this year  a major positive for potential homeowners Our ChoicesDespite the decline in housing starts for May  the housing sector seems set for a rebound over the next few months  This is borne out by the increase in building permits  particularly for single family homes  Steady wage gains and low mortgage rates are helping to attract several prospective homeowners into the housing market This is why it makes sense to invest in stocks set to gain from the coming rebound in housing  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a

114341,335856,BLDR,4 Top Ranked Growth Stocks After Recent Market Pullback,opinion,"Investors have seemingly enjoyed generous profits during the extended post election stock rally  However  last week s turmoil is a reminder that the market is fraught with risks and seems uncertain as ever  Rising interest rates  rapid technological change and the possibility of a trade war has made investors jittery in recent times 
Yet  if history is anything to go by  this skepticism on the part of investors offers a compelling case for the market to go up  Once the market starts to turn around  the bears will be forced to buy 
Hence  we believe that often  best trades are initiated during wayward times like these  If we stick to the script and focus on time tested screens  we are likely to find fantastic stock ideas  Talking about scripts  growth stocks have always told the most magnificent stories  haven t they 
However  the question lingers   how to single out the cream of the crop from the dime a dozen growth stocks that are on investors  radar these days  Over the last decade  economic conditions have nudged investors to put money on growth stocks  This indicates that such stocks have now already appreciated  However  we believe that when overall growth becomes hard to find  growth stocks will outperform 
Here we present some of the best growth stocks in this market  which have declined somewhat in last week s market correction  These stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and hold a Growth Style Score of A  Our research shows that the top Growth Style Score  when combined with a top Zacks Rank  offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space  You can see  
Further  these stocks have been witnessing positive interest from analysts lately and belong to industries that rank roughly in the top one third  per the Zacks Industry Rank system  This way  we can ensure that our picks are poised to benefit from a bullish outlook for their respective industry

114400,335915,BLDR,5 Broker Friendly Stocks To Beat Market Blues,opinion,The ongoing earnings season has unveiled a rosy picture so far with many companies reporting better than expected earnings  According to the latest   78 6  of the 341 S P 500 companies that have reported thus far have outperformed earnings estimates This is highly encouraging as an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation  Investors like to add outperformers to their portfolios  which can fetch them handsome returns Markets Narrate a Different StoryDespite the impressive Q4 performance  the U S  equity market has been witnessing a roller coaster ride  Both the Dow as well as the S P 500 entered into the correction territory on Feb 9  down more than 10  from the all time high reached in January The steep sell off was due to stronger than expected job additions along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years  These factors  in turn  triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected The heightened volatility is reflected in the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index

detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  buy  sell or hold a stock   In view of their expertise and profound understanding of stocks and the surroundings of the investing world  it is a no brainer that investors should pay heed to broker advice to generate garner the maximum from their portfolios Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers follow the stocks in their coverage closely  they revise their earnings estimates on a stock after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Their action is certainly not arbitrary or illogical  Thus  the estimate revisions serve as an important guide regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings results often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Value the Top lineTo design a winning strategy it is not wise to consider only the bottom line only  In fact  according to some market watchers  a top line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than a mere earnings beat  under some circumstances  Therefore  to make our strategy full proof  one needs to address top line concerns as well  We have considered the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric  for screening stocks  Screening Criteria   Up Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the

114465,335980,BLDR,4 Stocks To Watch Today  ADXS  CAPN  GIMO  ORMP,opinion,"It was kind of a crummy market on Monday  particularly at the end of the day  It started off with a bang  rolled over  and closed at the lows  It s nothing to be too concerned about yet  not until we see if there s any downside follow through  Meanwhile  a lot of our stocks continue to do great 

Advaxis Inc  NASDAQ ADXS  is unbelievable  This stock has gone from 2 1 2 3 4 in November to Monday s close at 21 1 2  a 10 fold increase  It s long in the tooth  but it has had legs 1 and 2 up  and leg 3 looks like it may be ending  The 17 and 19 dollar swing trades have been met  The high on Monday was 21 53  before backing off  It did come on again  and it did have another successful day  Basically  10 out of 11 days it s been up  The OBV is continuing  As long as the rising bottoms continue to rise  we can continue with this stock  The low was 19 20  I would like to stop this under 19 in case it does a couple point pullback here  If momentum carries it forward  we could see 24 25 in this stock 

Capnia Inc  NASDAQ CAPN  had a nice day on Monday  It popped out of a wedge  and  although it didn t close behind the range it did disappoint a little bit  It was up 40 cents  or 6   on 411 500 shares traded  The volume increased a little  It could be the beginning of a move  We ll have to keep close tabs on it  Short term trade consider stopping under the 6 6 15 zone  On the long side  if it gets above the 8 1 4 range  I think it will take off  first the 10 zone  then 12  and then we ll see what s next 

Gigamon Inc  NYSE GIMO   a swing trade of ours  extended on Monday  up nearly another 1 00  or 4 1 4   on 1 1 million shares  That s the best volume in about 8 weeks  When breaking out more volume is always a good thing  Look for it to head up towards the 26 7 zone 

Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ORMP  had a fantastic day on Monday  with a massive pop of 2 41  or 38 7   on 2 9 million shares  It didn t close great  It was 1 20 off the high  Nevertheless  that s key resistance  and may be the reason it backed off  Let s see what kind of a consolidation or follow through it gets  if any  Resistance is obviously up around the 9 85 area  The next targets are 11 1 2 and 14

Cyberark Software Ltd  NASDAQ CYBR   after the pop and pullback for a few days  formed a little wedge  held the breakout point  and accelerated back up on Wednesday  up 2 95 to 61 66  or 5   on 2 4 million shares  If it gets through the 63 1 2 range  look for it to make a move to retest 70  and then get into the mid 70 s 
3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  is one of the 3D group that has really bombed of late  to say the least  It was on our short list for a long time  On Wednesday  jumped 1 77 to 31 95  or 5 86   on 4 million shares  It has gone from almost 100  down to the high 20 s  This stock based out by forming a triple bottom  and then started to move up  First  it took out the declining topsline a few days ago  stalled for two days  letting the moving averages cross over  or curl up and begin to cross over  and now has accelerated to a resistance level near the 33 1 4 area  If it can blow through here  the next target is 37 38  but if it stalls in here  and sets up  it s going to be important how it sets up  whether it pulls back sharply or flags in this zone  We ll keep an eye on that one  20 days to cover could fuel the advance 
First Solar  Inc   NASDAQ FSLR  is one of the leaders of the solar group  if not the leader  This stock has gone from the mid 70 s in Sept  down to below 40 in mid Jan  formed a base  exploded out of the base with a breakaway gap  ran up  consolidated 5 6 weeks  and on Wednesday moved 2 67  closing at 53 74  or 4 4   on 3 7 million shares  That s the best volume in 4 weeks  It could move  at this point  past the 67 8 zone short term  and then maybe as high as 74 to try to test the Sept high  That goes for the rest of the group  including Sunedison Inc  NYSE SUNE   and SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY   two of my favorites 
Stratasys Ltd  NASDAQ SSYS  looks like it s coming alive  which is the reason why I put that out on Wednesday  It has 10 days to cover  This is a quality company in the 3D printing group  It has had a lengthy decline  going from the 130 range in mid 2014  all the way down to the 50 51 range  The recent bounce wasn t unexpected  but the fact that it took out the declining topsline  first resistance  and the 50  on a close of 3 37 to 61 43  or 5 8   on 1 7 million shares  was surprising  It looks like it could be the beginning  After testing the prior cycle in February look for it to get up to  at least  65ish  but the target is 67 1 2 3 4  and then 68  Let s see what happens beyond that
