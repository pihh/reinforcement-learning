11293,232808,AX,Can Value Investors Consider AXOS FINANCIAL  AX  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AXOS FINANCIAL INC  COMMON STOCK   NYSE AX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AXOS FINANCIAL has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 89  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 13  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  AXOS FINANCIAL s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 14 08 over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 75  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  AXOS FINANCIAL has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 59  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Southern  NYSE SO  First stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AXOS FINANCIAL has a P S ratio of about 2 87  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 07x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AXOS FINANCIAL currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AXOS FINANCIAL a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though AXOS FINANCIAL might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B  This gives AX a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen no upward revision versus three downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the full year estimates have seen no upward and four downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 2 6  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 5 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AXOS FINANCIAL  INC Price and Consensus   Despite such bearish analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAXOS FINANCIAL is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 17  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the rank and industry performance to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire One out of every six people

4 Winning Stocks to Buy on Earnings Acceleration
As we are in the thick of the earnings season  investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price 
But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement 
Future Outperformers
Basically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration 
In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 
Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 
This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance

The market is gapping higher this morning and will become officially overheated today by the close based on one of Pradeep Bonde most trusted indicator   What you usually see when this indicator flashes a caution signal is junk stocks start to fly for the next few days and then you see choppiness   retracement over the next week or so   So far this year this indicator has flashed a signal on  1 2 1 3     1 8 1 23    2 25    3 3 3 12    6 18 6 19   6 30    7 2    This signal is most dangerous and actionable shorting wise when it persist for a few days like it did at the beginning of the year   But at the same time it provides a big opportunity for oversize gains in what many consider junk stocks   I will keep you updated on this indicator 
The watch list today is rather short and based on this morning gap up I would assume not many will be actionable

Every morning I go through a few of my scans to find buy candidates for the day   Depending on the current state of the market the size of the list will vary  usually its no more than 50 names   My process is based on market structure not on beliefs or myths of what works  or what doesn t work   They are certain behavioral patterns that have been around for 100 years that are based on market structure  these behavioral patterns are recognizable  observable  and quantifiable   On daily basis we have 5 000 stocks that we filter based on certain market structures that gives us an edge of a higher probability than a random outcome   Once the list is narrowed to a handful of names the market will further narrow down the list by getting us in or keeping us out of these names with a range expansion move 
 I don t look at charts in your conventional cookie cutter manner  or have rules as to where the stock should be whether its 15  off its 52 week highs or above or below certain moving averages etc 
These are what I consider  tight set ups  that will trigger a buy signal for me if  and only when they break the previous day s high   On a regular trading day I would indiscriminately take every trigger because you just don t know which one will be the big winner  you might have an idea but in the end you don t know 
How much you put at risk per trade depends for the most part what your current outlook is for the market over the next 0 5 days 
Put these names on your trading platform  set the alerts at yesterday s high for each name  once the alert goes off take a look at the chart  decided within 3 seconds whether or not you are going to buy it  decide how much you want to risk on the trade and your stop loss  hit the buy button  and leave the rest up to the market  wash  rinse  repeat

11378,232893,AX,Is BofI Holding  BOFI  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BofI Holding  Inc    NASDAQ BOFI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BofI Holding has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares somewhat favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 2  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts BofI Holding s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that BofI Holding has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for BofI Holding s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BOFI has a P S ratio of about 3 7  This is lower than the industry s average  which comes in at 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BofI Holding currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BOFI a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for BofI Holding is just 1 2  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 13 9  which is better than the industry average of 15 8  Clearly  BOFI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though BofI Holding might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives BMRC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current year and next has seen one upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward As a result  the current year consensus estimate has dropped 1 2  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has also decreased 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BofI Holding  Inc  Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBofI Holding is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock   In fact  over the past three months  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  However  given the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone

11385,232900,AX,4 Winning Stocks To Buy On Earnings Acceleration ,opinion,As we are in the thick of the earnings season  investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  In addition to this  we have added the following parameters Current Price greater
