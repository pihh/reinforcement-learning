9924,231439,NDAQ,No deal Brexit likely to reduce Britain s power trading liquidity by 10 20 ,news,"By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos
OSLO  Reuters    The liquidity of Britain s short term power markets is likely to fall by 10 20  if the country leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of October  a senior executive at the EPEX SPOT power exchange told Reuters 
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct  31  If it does so without a deal  it would no longer be coupled to European power markets  In the case of a deal  however  cross border trading will not be affected during a transition period agreed with the EU 
The intraday and day ahead markets are among the most liquid products of a power exchange  They represent power that is traded for use within the same day and electricity for physical delivery the following day 
The high liquidity means that any loss of transaction volumes would hit profit at the power exchanges 
 For our traders  it is clearly a disadvantage      A no deal Brexit  is likely to have an effect on the liquidity of the market  particularly on the day ahead time frame   said EPEX SPOT s director for public and regulatory affairs  Wolfram Vogel 
Market liquidity would fall by 10 20  for intraday and day ahead power trading combined  Vogel said without elaborating on how long it would take for the market to recover 
EPEX did not have a detailed plan to compensate for any lost liquidity  a spokeswoman said 
Cross border day ahead transactions in their current form will stop  added Vogel  and EPEX SPOT would instead organize local day ahead auctions in Britain 
Trading within day electricity with Ireland  however  would remain unaffected  he said 
EPEX SPOT is working on expanding in the Nordics and Vogel said the exchange s within day and day ahead operations in the region are likely to begin between November and January 
A Norwegian license to operate day ahead power trading is still pending  he said  together with more technical details that need to be finalised with the Nordic transmission system operators 
EPEX SPOT is in contact with members that already trade in the Nordics  Vogel added  and its sales team is working on adding new customers  offering participation fee discounts 
EPEX s parent  EEX  is Deutsche Boerse s  DE DB1Gn  flagship power derivatives market  EEX already trades financial power derivative contracts in the Nordics  competing with Nasdaq  O NDAQ  in the futures market 
The start of operations in the Nordics will mean the end of Nord Pool s local monopoly in intraday and day ahead trading ",2019-08-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nodeal-brexit-likely-to-reduce-britains-power-trading-liquidity-by-1020-1960324,1960324

9937,231452,NDAQ,Wall Street finds blockchain hard to tame after early euphoria,news,"By Anna Irrera and John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    Two years ago Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  and  Citigroup  Inc  N C  announced a new blockchain system they said would make payments of private securities transactions more efficient  Nasdaq Chief Executive Adena Friedman called it  a milestone in the global financial sector   But the companies did not move forward with the project  a person familiar with it said  because while it worked in testing  the cost to fully adopt it outweighed the benefits   Blockchain  the person added   is a shiny mirage  and its wide scale adoption may still  take a while    In a joint statement  the companies said the pilot was successful and they were  happy to partner  on other initiatives  Both companies are also working on other projects  Companies  including banks  large retailers and technology vendors  are investing billions of dollars to find uses for blockchain  a digital ledger used by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin  Just last month   Facebook Inc   O FB  revealed plans for a virtual currency and a blockchain based payment system   But a review of 33 projects involving large companies announced over the past four years and interviews with more than a dozen executives involved with them show the technology has yet to deliver on its promise   At least a dozen of these projects  which involve major banks  exchanges and technology firms  have not gone beyond the testing phase  the review shows  Those that have made it past that stage are yet to see extensive usage   Regulatory hurdles have often slowed down implementation  some executives said  Scrutiny is likely to only increase after Facebook s plans drew global backlash from regulators and politicians   For a sample of these projects  click   The euphoria that surrounded the early days of Wall Street s interest in blockchain is giving way to pragmatism  as companies realize that it will likely take years before it takes off in a substantial way    This is a transformation of the market  It isn t a big bang   said Hyder Jaffrey  head of strategic investments for UBS AG s  S UBSG  investment bank  It could take three to seven years before major projects have significant impact  he said  One UBS backed project  a digital cash system for financial transactions called Utility Settlement Coin  is expected to be commercialized next year after more than five years of work  said Rhomaios Ram  head of a separate entity created for the project   But Ram said that for the system to be transformational  it will require other market processes to move to blockchain based systems as well   There is a recognition now that it is a journey  rather than something with a short time frame   Ram said  BLOCKCHAIN S PROMISE Blockchain was created about a decade ago as a way to keep track of bitcoin transactions  As cryptocurrencies became more mainstream following a 2013 rally and crash in bitcoin s price  consultants  analysts and other proponents said their underlying technology could be transformational  especially for the financial industry   It could help trades settle instantly  accelerate international payments and remove the need for costly intermediaries  potentially saving the industry tens of billions of dollars  they said  Investment followed  Last year the

areas at the same time  technology  demand and compliance   Those of us who were involved in blockchain early on maybe did not appreciate the extent to which the three parts have to move together   Whelan said  Santander is involved in numerous blockchain projects  including the Utility Settlement Coin  Around the time the project with Citi was announced in 2017  Nasdaq also started testing a proxy voting system in Estonia that automates a manual and lengthy process   Lars Ottersgard  Nasdaq s head of market technology  said demand has been limited for the product   To be honest  the value

9945,231460,NDAQ,Investor trade groups back U S  SEC plan opposed by exchanges,news,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK  Reuters    A disputed plan by U S  regulators to study how stock exchange fees and incentives affect brokers  trading habits is in the best interest of investors and should go forward  trade groups representing many of the largest asset managers said in a legal filing on Thursday 
The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission s  Transaction Fee Pilot  is aimed at evaluating how rebate payments most stock exchanges make to brokers for stock orders that add liquidity influences brokers  behavior  The regulator delayed its start date in March after the three largest exchange operators sued to kill the pilot 
The exchanges say rebates help attract liquidity  while also compensating brokers  especially market makers  for taking the risk of providing two sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against  Without them  bid ask spreads will widen out  making it more costly to trade  the exchanges have argued 
The system has many critics 
 The transaction fee pilot is a constructive and long overdue first step toward fixing an outdated and byzantine pricing model that is badly in need of reform   the Investment Company Institute  ICI  and the Council of Institutional Investors  CII  said in a joint amicus brief in support of the SEC   It should be allowed to proceed  
The trade groups  which represent institutional investors managing tens of trillions of dollars worth of assets  said the pricing system gives brokers an incentive to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the most  even if those customer orders might get better results elsewhere 
Collectively  Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ   Cboe Global Markets  Z CBOE  and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   paid out about  2 5 billion last year in rebates  which can be key drivers in attracting market share 
ICI and CII also said the system increases market complexity by fueling the proliferation of trading venues that offer various pricing models catering to high speed traders  which make up half the trading volume in the market  looking to harvest rebates

9946,231461,NDAQ,Exchange fee fight moves from NYSE floor to data center rooftop,news,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK  Reuters    The fight between brokers and exchanges around fees and access to trading information has moved from stock exchange floors to data center rooftops 
A move by the New York Stock Exchange to install microwave equipment on the roof of its data center to speed up data transmissions is  anti competitive  and could result in higher trading costs  trading firm Virtu Financial  O VIRT  said in a letter to the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
Virtu opposed the NYSE s plan because it would allow only one wireless provider   chosen by the exchange   to locate an antenna on the rooftop of the exchange operator s Mahwah  New Jersey  data center  due to  resource and engineering constraints   according to the letter  which was posted to the SEC s website on July 25 
NYSE  which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   declined to comment  as did the SEC 
Microwaves carry data more quickly than fiber optic cables  allowing firms that use high frequency trading strategies  including Virtu  to complete algorithm driven trades at close to light speed 
If its plan goes forward  it could effectively give NYSE a monopoly over access to the fastest data  allowing it to charge exorbitant fees for access to its antenna  while shutting out potentially lower cost wireless providers  Virtu said 
Just as NYSE would never have been allowed to sell space on its exchange floor at a premium price that advantaged one member over others  neither should it be allowed to do the same with rooftop access  Virtu argued 
 The reality is that the new  floor  of the NYSE is actually now located on the roof of a nondescript data center in Mahwah   Virtu said 
The disagreement is part of an ongoing dispute over the cost of market data  with Virtu  one of the world s largest trading and market making firms  one of the most vocal critics 
Market data  including bids  asks and last sale prices  is essential to trading  but is also one of the biggest revenue sources for many exchanges 
Last year the SEC put a wide swath of exchange fees under review as part of a broader effort to improve transparency around exchange pricing  In May the regulator also released guidance telling exchanges to improve justification of their fees or continue to have them temporarily suspended and reviewed 
Virtu is also one of nine founding members of the Members Exchange  a low cost bourse being built to challenge NYSE and Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  ",2019-08-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exchange-fee-fight-moves-from-nyse-floor-to-data-center-rooftop-1946873,1946873

9992,231507,NDAQ,Startup Extraordinary Re to launch exchange for insurance risk,news,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK  Reuters    Large investors looking to diversify beyond stocks and traditional fixed income will soon be able to trade assets tied to insurance liabilities covering potentially everything from hurricanes to floods and even cyber attacks 
Extraordinary Re  a startup focused on the reinsurance industry  plans to launch a new trading platform run by exchange operator Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  this summer that will let institutional investors buy and sell exposure to insurance risk  the company said on Thursday 
The privately backed company will create new products for the  90 billion insurance linked securities  ILS  market and make it easier to participate in  Extraordinary Re Chief Executive Officer Will Dove said in an interview
The ILS market developed over the past couple of decades as a way for insurance companies to pass some of their risk associated with natural disasters   usually hurricanes and earthquakes   on to investors by issuing catastrophe bonds  or CAT bonds  If no catastrophe hits  the bonds pay out a percentage of the premiums by way of coupons  But if a disaster does occur  the insurance company can use the funds to pay claims to its policy holders 
Extraordinary Re will let insurance companies create  liquid insurance contracts  that will allow institutional investors to buy and sell shares of insurance liabilities on the cloud based exchange built and operated by Nasdaq 
Investors will be able to create portfolios of liabilities on the platform using combinations of contracts  giving them a share of the insurance premiums  but also exposing them to potential losses if the underlying policies are triggered 
 These are very different from a CAT bond because they are really a share of a liability that can be reallocated between investors on the Extraordinary Re platform   Dove said 
 They don t have a coupon  they don t have a final maturity date  rather they represent a participation in a reinsurance contract and that innovation is what allows us to be able to handle really any type of insurance and reinsurance risk   he said

legitimacy for the cyptocurrency when futures trading launches this weekend  but experts worry the risks associated with bitcoin s Wild West like nature could overshadow the debut  The first bitcoin future trades kick off Sunday at 6 p m  EST  2300 GMT  on Cboe Global Markets Inc s  O CBOE  Cboe Futures Exchange  followed a week later by CME Group Inc s  O CME  CME   Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  plans to get into the mix next year  Reuters reported  While Cboe  CME and Nasdaq offer strictly policed trading environments  the underlying bitcoin market is riddled with crypto exchanges lacking even basic oversight  That has stoked fears of market manipulation  inaccurate pricing and systemic risk to clearing houses    I m kind of taken aback by what s happened in the last three months   said Richard Johnson  an analyst at Greenwich Associates who owns digital currencies and considers himself a bitcoin bull   I m concerned things are moving a bit too quickly    Some of the world s largest brokers on Thursday voiced concerns about the process through which bitcoin futures had come to market  noting that market participants should have been better consulted on issues such as margin levels and trading limits   Through an open letter to the U S  derivatives watchdog from the Futures Industry Association  the brokers said more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin s high volatility and the risk of manipulation in the underlying spot market    We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based   the FIA letter said   Bitcoin s more than 10 fold upsurge this year has led to warnings of a bubble by the likes of JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon  who called it  a fraud  that will eventually blow up  Others  like Wall Street adviser Tom Lee  expect bitcoin to top  100 000  On Thursday  its hypervolatility was on full display as it broke through  15 000 for the first time on the Luxembourg based Bitstamp exchange  BTC BTSP   jumping more than 12 percent from the previous day   Since August 2011  bitcoin has averaged a daily price change of nearly 3 percent  up or down  compared with a daily average change in the U S  dollar euro cross rate  of less than 0 5 percent since the euro s debut in 1999   Maybe it s just the most unique market that is going to continue to go up forever and ever and so everybody on the long side is going to make money and it s a great thing  but I ve been around long enough to know that s not going to work out so well   said John Lothian  CEO of advisory firm John J Lothian and Company  As a virtual currency  bitcoin can be used to move money around the world without the need for a central authority  such as a bank or government  which is a double edged sword  said Steve Grob  director of group strategy at Fidessa   There is no backstop  If suddenly tomorrow everyone decided bitcoin was worthless  it would be worthless  and I m not sure whether people have really thought that one through   he said  Traditional banks remain skeptical of dealing with bitcoin exchanges  Earlier this year   Wells Fargo    Co  N WFC  stopped processing wire transfers for an exchange called Bitfinex  leaving customers unable to transfer U S  dollars out of their accounts  except through special arrangement with the exchange s lawyer   Still  new entrants  from retail investors to high frequency traders  have piled into bitcoin  U S  based crypto exchange Coinbase said it added 100 000 accounts in the three days around the U S  Thanksgiving holiday  for 13 1 million overall   If the futures market were to exceed the size of the spot market  with current daily trading volume of around  6 billion per day  the underlying price could be more susceptible to manipulation  said Kevin Zhou  co founder of crypto currency fund Galois Capital   You ve seen these problems before in bitcoin futures  where right before the settlement  the price pegs it high or low and then bounces back right after   he said   GRAPHIC  Bitcoin price hits record high     RISK OF AN  AVALANCHE  As volumes increase  there are also questions about the robustness of the technology at bitcoin exchanges  Lothian said   Particularly when you re talking about a high frequency approach to this where people are trying to arb multiple exchanges   Last month  the Gemini bitcoin exchange  which will set the price for Cboe s futures contract  and GDAX and Kraken  two of the four exchanges in CME s bitcoin index  had systems

representative  recently told Reuters in an email  Kraken is planning to launch a new trade engine  soon  which should increase the exchange s capacity  Yee said  The volatile nature of bitcoin could also present a risk to clearing houses  said Thomas Peterffy  CEO of Interactive Brokers Group Inc  O IBKR   Clearing houses act as a middlemen between the parties to futures transactions  If there were a wild price swing in bitcoin and a smaller brokerage failed to meet its margin call  the clearing house would have to take over the position  further moving the price of bitcoin  which could cause other brokers to fail  Peterffy said    If that happens at a time when bitcoin spikes up for whatever crazy reason  there could be an avalanche   he said  Questions like these have kept some futures market operators on the sidelines  for now  Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   owner of the New York Stock Exchange and ICE Futures U S   opted not to join CME and Cboe in the race to be

10010,231525,NDAQ,Bitcoin blows past  16 000  alarm bells ring louder,news,"By Jemima Kelly and Gertrude Chavez Dreyfuss LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    Bitcoin rocketed to a lifetime high well above  16 000 on Thursday after climbing some 67 percent over one week  intensifying the debate about whether the cryptocurrency is in a bubble about to burst  The largest U S  cryptocurrency exchange struggled to keep up with record traffic as the price surged  with an upcoming launch of the first bitcoin futures contract further fueling investor interest   Proponents say bitcoin is a good medium of exchange and a way to store value  much like a precious metal  They also argue it is preferable to traditional currencies because it is not subject to central bank manipulation  The supply of bitcoin will eventually be capped at 21 million  and some 16 7 million have already been released   But critics say that the price run up is a bubble that has been driven mostly by speculation  leaving bitcoin vulnerable to a sharp reversal  JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  Chief Executive Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a fraud in September   Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset that remains in uncharted waters  we ve simply not experienced this before   said Nigel Green  founder and chief executive of deVere Group    Also  an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors   he added  The world s biggest cryptocurrency has surged seventeen fold in value so far this year   The latest move brought its so called market cap  its price multiplied by the number of bitcoins in circulation  to nearly  305 billion  according to Coinmarketcap  a trade website  By comparison  the market value of Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT  is around  288 billion   Analysts said the launch slated for this weekend of bitcoin futures by Cboe Global Markets Inc s  O CBOE  Cboe Futures Exchange  one of the world s biggest derivatives exchanges  was helping drive up the price on expectations it would draw more investors to the market  The CME Group  NASDAQ CME  will launch bitcoin futures one week later  while Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  plans to get into the mix next year  It is not clear to what extent big U S  banks will participate in the new bitcoin related activity    Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  will clear bitcoin futures for certain clients when they go live  a spokeswoman said on Thursday   The bank is  evaluating the specifications and risk attributes for the bitcoin futures contracts as part of our standard due diligence process   spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said  Bitcoin climbed as high as  16 615 62 on the Luxembourg based Bitstamp exchange  BTC BTSP   up nearly 22 percent on the day  It was last at  16 607 14  Coinbase  the largest U S  platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies  said on Thursday on Twitter that it had experienced an outage due to record traffic  The venue was last up and running  Some investors said they still see scope for bitcoin to soar even higher   It will hit potentially  20 000 because so much capital is coming in and it s the most liquid secure coin out there   said David Drake  founder and chairman of DLJ Capital  a family office in New York  Other trading venues showed different prices for bitcoin  which trades in more than 100 cryptocurrency exchanges that are not accountable to any central authority  For instance  at institutional trading platform GDAX  bitcoin topped  19 000  while it hit above  16 000 at itBit  Those price discrepancies could add another level of speculation by introducing the prospect of arbitrage trades between the markets   For graphic on bitcoin prices   STOKING VOLATILITY Some warned that the launch of bitcoin futures  which will allow investors to take speculative short positions to bet against the cryptocurrency  as well as long positions  could spark further volatility   And while Cboe  CME and Nasdaq offer strictly policed trading environments  the underlying bitcoin market is riddled with exchanges lacking even basic oversight  The Futures Industry Association  representing some of the world s largest brokers  sent a letter on Thursday to the U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission saying that more safeguards are needed to protect against bitcoin s high volatility and the risk of manipulation in the spot market   Aggressive traders  such as hedge funds and algorithm driven funds   will be able  to use this futures market to enter bitcoin trading with high levels of liquidity for aggressive short selling and knock the prices really low   said Think Markets analyst Naeem Aslam   Players now have an incentive to be on the short side and make profits hedging against the upside   Concerns about cybersecurity could also take the shine off of bitcoin   Slovenian cryptocurrency mining marketplace NiceHash  which matches people looking to sell processing time on computers in exchange for bitcoin  said on Thursday it had lost about  64 million worth of bitcoin in a hack of its payment system  Bitcoin slumped in 2014 when MtGox  then the world s biggest bitcoin exchange  collapsed after saying it had been hacked and had 650 000 bitcoins stolen   The value of all cryptocurrencies now stands at nearly  430 billion  according to Coinmarketcap

10096,231611,NDAQ,Top 5 Things to Know In the Market on Wednesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday  April 26 
1  Trump s tax reform ahead
On a day with no major economic data  markets seemed to be in a holding pattern while waiting for an expected tax reform announcement from U S  President Donald Trump s administration later in the day 
Trump is expected to propose cutting the income tax rate paid by public corporations to 15  from 35   and allowing multinationals to bring in overseas profits at a tax rate of 10  versus 35  now 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn are set to conduct a joint news conference at around 1 30PM ET  17 30GMT  on Wednesday from the White House Briefing Room to announce the tax plan 
2  Government shutdown worries recede  North Korea remains in focus
The threat of a U S  government shutdown this weekend appeared to recede after Trump backed away from a demand that Congress include funding for his planned border wall with Mexico in a spending bill 
Republicans and Democrats still have difficult issues to resolve as they face a Friday night deadline when existing money expires for many federal agencies  threatening Trump s 100th day in office on Saturday could be marked by the government shutdown 
Also on markets  radar  Trump invited all 100 members of the Senate to attend the session with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Marine General Joseph Dunford  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff later on Wednesday with hopes to forge a strategy to deal with North Korea s development of nuclear weapons and long range ballistic missiles 
The same four officials will then go to Capitol Hill to brief the entire House at 5 00PM ET  21 00GMT   a senior House aide said 
3  Global stocks mixed ahead of Trump tax reform
Global stocks saw mixed trade on Wednesday as markets took a breather ahead of the presentation of the Trump administration s tax reform proposal 
U S  stock futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wednesday after the Nasdaq closed at record highs above 6 000 points and positive earnings left the Dow within a hair s breadth of 21 000  At 5 56AM ET  9 56GMT   the blue chip Dow futures gained 0 21   S P 500 futures edged forward 0 04  and the Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0 09  
Elsewhere  little movement was seen in a quiet day for European equities after their five day rally  At 5 57AM ET  9 57GMT   Germany s DAX slipped 0 03   France s CAC 40 rose 0 12   while London s FTSE 100 gave up 0 05  
Earlier  Asia rode the tails of the Wall Street rally  closing higher with Japan s Nikkei 225 particularly benefitting from the flight from the safe haven yen amid a risk on environment 
4  Earnings continue to support stocks
Just as strong blue chip earnings boosted the Dow by more than 200 points a day earlier  they will remain in focus throughout Wednesday s session 
In a week where no less than 190 S P firms release their quarterly numbers  Boeing  NYSE BA  and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  will be the blue chip stars to report ahead of Wednesday s open amid a slew of earnings throughout the day including the likes of Twitter  NYSE TWTR    Pepsico   NYSE PEP   Hershey  NYSE HSY   Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN   Buffalo Wild Wings  NASDAQ BWLD    Dr Pepper Snapple  Group  NYSE DPS   PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL   Nasdaq Inc  NASDAQ NDAQ  or  State Street   NYSE STT  
As of late Tuesday  153 S P companies had reported earnings with 76  beating earnings estimates and 68  topping sales forecasts  according to The Earnings Scout 
 Based on the first 31  of the companies in the S P 500 reporting first quarter results  there is no doubt earnings per share growth will exceed 10  for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014   these experts said 
5  Oil sticks near 4 week low ahead of inventories
Oil prices edged lower on Wednesday  staying close to the prior session s four week trough after data overnight showed a surprise gain in U S  crude supplies  casting doubt over OPEC s ability to cut output and tighten the market 
After markets closed Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute said that U S  oil inventories unexpectedly rose by 897 000 barrels in the week ended April 21  compared to expectations for a draw of 1 3 million barrels 
The U S  Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10 30AM ET  14 30GMT  Wednesday

10106,231621,NDAQ,Wall Street braces for rough ride as exchanges seek more speed bumps,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stock exchanges that spent decades speeding up markets with cutting edge technology are now rushing to slow them down  The New York Stock Exchange  Chicago Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  are all awaiting decisions by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission on whether they can delay trades through so called  speed bumps  and new order types   The SEC is expected to approve or reject their proposals in the coming weeks  The about face comes after advances in technology made it possible to complete trades almost at the speed of light  prompting concerns by some market participants that sophisticated high frequency traders were eating the lunch of ordinary investors  Exchanges have profited from selling specialized services to high frequency traders  which make up more than half of U S  trading volume  But now they are looking at ways to attract a wider range of investors  at least to certain of their trading venues  or are making sure they are keeping up with each other  The SEC approved the market s first speed bump last year  but rules around intentionally slowing down trades are vague and it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the proposals will pass  SEC staff are scrutinizing how each exchange justifies its plans  said a person familiar with the matter   Whenever you have something that applies to one group and not others  it s discriminatory in some sense   said the person  who asked for anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the media   The question is  can you justify the discrimination   The proposals follow the launch of IEX Group  which burst onto the scene last August with the market s inaugural speed bump and other features they said would level the playing field and protect small investors from high speed trading chicanery  Other exchanges were some of IEX s fiercest opponents and there is still a heated debate about whether the upstart is as altruistic as it was portrayed in Michael Lewis s best selling book  Flash Boys  A Wall Street Revolt   However  its new way of doing business ultimately forced rivals to rethink their own strategies   Exchanges  reputations hinge on their ability to execute orders quickly and seamlessly for brokers  which are required to get customers the best market prices  Lewis s book scandalized Wall Street with its claim that exchanges were rigging the market by allowing high frequency traders to use their speed to effectively jump the queue of orders from ordinary investors  known in the industry as  latency arbitrage   Many on Wall Street dispute that such a thing exists   Nevertheless  high frequency trading firms pay exchanges huge sums for near light speed market access and data to drive their algorithms  and have become an increasingly large player in the stock market over the past decade   IEX ran counter to the trend by establishing an exchange that does not make speed the primary factor and does not sell things like access to microwave and laser data feeds that give ultra fast traders an edge  The approach appealed to many customers  including several institutional investors  and the exchange now has 2 percent of the U S  stock trading market   Graphic     Most traditional exchanges initially opposed IEX s speed bump proposal  but have since had a change of heart  since it has become clear that some investors want to see such change    The SEC  by approving IEX s exchange application  has opened up the marketplace for the potential for innovation around market structure that really has not been available to us for the last almost 10 years   said Nasdaq Chief Executive Adena Friedman   UN AMERICAN  In giving IEX the green light  the SEC said exchanges could pause trades for up to a millisecond  as long as the delays were not unfairly discriminatory or anti competitive   The NYSE  which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   essentially wants to copy IEX s speed bump  as well as an order type the startup pioneered  NYSE argues that while it previously said the model was bad for the market  some institutional investors prefer it and NYSE should be allowed to offer them the choice  NYSE  whose chairman once called IEX  un American   also plans to rename its proposed speed bump exchange NYSE American from NYSE MKT  NYSE s main New York Stock Exchange market would remain unchanged   In contrast  the Chicago Stock Exchange put forward a speed bump plan that some brokers can bypass if they meet strict requirements to provide quotes for others  In doing so  it hopes to create more liquidity  Rather than a speed bump  Nasdaq wants to introduce an  extended life  order type  It would apply only to orders generated by regular  mom and pop investors  who tend to be less informed and therefore coveted by professional traders  The orders would sit exposed for at least a second and then jump ahead of other investors to get filled   Wall Street lacks consensus on whether the proposed delays are a good idea  Some high frequency trading firms have asked the SEC to deny the proposals  arguing that various time lags across 13 exchanges would make it difficult to know the true price of a stock at any given time  For its part  IEX has asked the SEC to reject NYSE s proposal  In an interview  Chief Market Policy Officer John Ramsay characterized some rivals  plans as disingenuous   The speed bump is just one piece of our market design and it s designed to work with all of the other pieces in tandem   said John Ramsay  IEX s Chief Market Policy Officer  Others support the new developments  
 The only one this impacts is the guy whose business model is to rely on speed in somewhat  I would argue  a pernicious manner   Doug Cifu  CEO of trading firm  Virtu Financial Inc   O VIRT   said in an interview ",2017-04-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-braces-for-rough-ride-as-exchanges-seek-more-speed-bumps-471138,471138

It also said its customers could choose between a lower capacity connection and the higher capacity connection to the new network  though firms that choose the lower capacity option would have to take responsibility if problems arise as a result ",2017-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nasdaq-amends-disputed-fee-proposal-for-key-stock-market-data-456247,456247

false alarms  FINRA monitors roughly 50 billion market  events  a day  including stock orders  modifications  cancellations and trades  It looks for around 270 patterns to uncover potential rule violations  It would not say how many events are flagged  or how many of those yield evidence of misbehavior  The  machine learning  software it is developing will be able to look beyond those set patterns and understand which situations truly warrant red flags  said Gira  Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in which computers figure out new tasks without having been programmed to do so  In the case of market surveillance  that would mean the computers  learn  which trading patterns lead to enforcement charges  in order to flag the right ones  FINRA plans to test

to detect dubious bragging or back slapping around the time of a big trade  It could also more quickly unravel complex issues  like  layering   where orders are rapidly sent to exchanges and then canceled to artificially move a stock price  A I  may even sniff out new types of chicanery  said Tom Gira  executive vice president for market regulation at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  FINRA    The biggest concern we have is that there is some manipulative scheme that we are not even aware of   he told Reuters   It seems like these tools have the potential to give us a better window into the market for those types of scenarios   FINRA plans to test artificial intelligence software being developed in house for surveillance next year  while Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  and the London Stock Exchange Group  L LSE  expect to use it by year end  The exchange operators also plan to sell the technology to banks and fund managers  so that they can monitor their traders  Artificial intelligence is the notion that computers can imitate nuanced human behavior  like understanding language  solving puzzles or even diagnosing diseases  It has been in development since the 1950s and is now used in some mainstream ways  like Siri  an application on Apple Inc s  O AAPL  iPhone that can engage in conversation and perform tasks  While financial firms are already applying artificial intelligence software for everything from compliance to stock picking  it is only starting to become useful for market oversight   We haven t really let the machines loose  as it were  on the surveillance side   said Bill Nosal  a Nasdaq business development executive who is overseeing its artificial intelligence effort  50 BILLION EVENTS Market surveillance generally relies on algorithms to detect patterns in trading data that may signal manipulation and prompt staff to investigate  But the sheer volume of data can lead to an overwhelming number of alerts  many of which are false alarms  FINRA monitors roughly 50 billion market  events  a day  including stock orders  modifications  cancellations and trades  It looks for around 270 patterns to uncover potential rule violations  It would not say how many events are flagged  or how many of those yield evidence of misbehavior  The  machine learning  software it is developing will be able to look beyond those set patterns and understand which situations truly warrant red flags  said Gira  Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in which computers figure out new tasks without having been programmed to do so  In the case of market surveillance  that would mean the computers  learn  which trading patterns lead to enforcement charges  in order to flag the right ones  FINRA plans to test the new tool next year alongside its existing systems to compare the results  The regulator has already moved its surveillance systems to Amazon com Inc s  O AMZN  web based Cloud  giving it more computing power to quickly analyze massive data  Nasdaq is working with cognitive computing firm Digital Reasoning  which it invested in earlier this year  LSE has teamed up with International Business Machine Corp s  N IBM  Watson business and cyber security firm SparkCognition to develop its A I  enhanced surveillance  Chris Corrado  chief operating officer of LSE Group  told Reuters in an interview  Watson has become something of a household name  having bested contestants in the game show  Jeopardy  in 2011  TRADER INTEGRITY The technology would not necessarily prevent events such as the 2010  flash crash   when the Dow Jones Industrial Average temporarily plunged more than 1 000 points  However  it could be quicker to catch manipulative behavior thought to contribute to them  potentially saving market watchdogs time and money  FINRA  Nasdaq and LSE would not provide specific figures for how much the software costs to develop or how much money they expect it to save  For instance  investigators spent years cross referencing trading data with old electronic communications to make their case against a group of global banks whose traders were rigging foreign exchange benchmarks     Nasdaq said the software it is testing with Digital Reasoning and other financial firms could do that task almost in real time  Artificial intelligence startup Neurensic on Wednesday launched a tool that creates an  integrity score  for traders based on how their trading patterns match up against patterns regulators have deemed suspicious   To have that information in terms of running your business more efficiently or proactively avoiding regulatory troubles is huge   said David Widerhorn  the firm s chief executive  
Neurensic has also worked with regulators on market manipulation investigations and is in talks with two exchanges on supplying artificial intelligence software for surveillance  he said ",2016-10-25,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/'siri,-catch-market-cheats':-wall-street-watchdogs-turn-to-a.i-434453",434453

10168,231683,NDAQ,Nasdaq Moves to Acquire Marketwired in Latest M A Move,news,"By Jeff Patterson
Nasdaq  O NDAQ  has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Marketwired  a worldwide provider of news distribution services and analytics in its latest merger and acquisition  M A  move to help solidify its position in the financial services industry  according to a Nasdaq statement 
Over the past year  Nasdaq embarked on an industry wide expansion of its services suite and capabilities  Most recently  the group made a play for Chi X Canada in an attempt to help fortify an existing link between American and Canadian markets  Prior to this  Nasdaq opted to look into expanding its blockchain ambitions abroad  which saw the planning of securities focused applications in Estonia 
Setting its sights on Marketwired would help Nasdaq tap into an extensive client pool of over 8 500 clients  which includes both private corporations and public relations agencies  Nasdaq s corporate services clients are expected to benefit from access to Marketwired s social media targeting tools and analytics 
Given the formal acquisition however  the deal is expected to close by the end of Q1 2016  and will be funded via a combination of debt and cash in hand  In material terms  the upcoming acquisition is also expected to yield no material effect on Nasdaq s non GAAP earnings within a period of twelve months after a closing date  abstaining from any impact on its financial leverage or capital return strategy 

According to Adena Friedman  President and Chief Operating Officer  CEO   Nasdaq  in a recent statement on the acquisition   This transaction is a testament to our commitment to growing this business and delivering the most innovative communications tools and intelligence to our Corporate Solutions clients across the investor relations and public relations solutions suite  
 There is a natural fit between the two organizations in terms of our long term strategy and shared values based around innovation and customer centricity  We are excited about the benefits this combination will provide to Marketwired clients through a broader global distribution network  a comprehensive end to end workflow solution  and improved customer service   added Adnan Ahmed  President and CEO  Marketwired  in an accompanying statement

10172,231687,NDAQ,Technology stocks selloff may turn IPO chill into IPO freeze,news,"By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    This winter was supposed to be Nutanix s time to shine  The high tech computing and storage company filed for a hotly anticipated initial public offering in December  ready to woo investors early in the New Year  But so far  Nutanix hasn t been able to shake the chill of what is shaping up to be a largely barren season for IPOs  And with the battering technology stocks have suffered in the past couple of weeks  and the dismal performance of technology IPOs in the past couple of years  any idea of a springtime busy with technology offerings may also be wishful thinking  Eric Jensen  an IPO attorney for Cooley LLP  said his firm has  a pretty significant pipeline of deals   with about 32 companies that have filed with regulators for IPOs  either confidentially or publicly  But he said plans by the five or so technology firms with a  1 billion plus valuation in that queue   are all stalled out    For a graphic showing the number and value of U S  technology IPOs  see  The cratering in technology stocks has also helped to push down the valuations of private tech companies and interest in investing in them  say capital markets experts  Fewer options for capital raising means that high flying companies may need to rein in spending  delay some ambitious expansion plans and even lay off staff  according to investors and tech consultants   IPO experts also say they expect more startups will get acquired cheaply  and go the way of Good Technology  a mobile security company once valued at  1 billion and last year sold to Blackberry  TO BB  for  425 million  It had planned an IPO but that never got off the ground   A lot of these companies are going to have to rein in their costs in order to survive   said Matt Brady  co founder and chief operating officer of investment firm Militello Capital  The markets tanked just as Apttus  which makes sales software for businesses  was putting the finishing touches on its IPO filing  CEO Kirk Krappe told Reuters he is still anticipating a debut in the second or third quarter  But he is running the company a little leaner  slowing down on hiring  and making sure there are ample cash reserves so he can be flexible with his IPO timing  INDIA EXPANSION PLAN In the seven years since it was launched  Nutanix  has attracted more than  300 million from investors including Khosla Ventures and Fidelity Investments  It had  241 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending July 31  2015  selling servers and storage systems to customers such as Nasdaq  Inc   O NDAQ   Nintendo Co   Ltd   T 7974   and  Nordstrom Inc   N JWN    Last year  it set out on a well trodden path for high growth tech startups  filing paperwork for an IPO that was expected to value the company at around  2 5 billion  and with its eye on a January debut  according to two people familiar with the matter  And yet  come mid February  that hasn t happened  Nutanix hasn t offered a price range for the sale  which usually precedes a week or two of investor presentations known as the roadshow  making the earliest possibility for a public debut weeks away  It is unclear what the delays will mean for Nutanix s growth plans  The company declined to comment for this article  Nutanix has been seeking to expand its customer base quickly  particularly among the large global companies  to hire aggressively and expand in developing nations such as India  according to regulatory filings and previous statements from the company  Employees will also have to wait longer to cash in their stock options  a hefty part of many tech employees  compensation  From August 2012 through November 2015  Nutanix granted more than 35 million shares of common stock at a price ranging from  1 22 to  15 06 to officers  directors and employees at the company  according to its IPO filing  It also granted more than six million restricted stock units  Nor has an IPO happened for any technology company so far this year  None have even priced  Indeed  January marked the first month since September 2011 without an IPO of any kind  according to Renaissance Capital  manager of IPO focused funds  Some had certainly been hoping to come to market  Cloud communications company Twilio filed for an IPO confidentially last year  while both security company Okta and cloud software startup Coupa have been in talks with bankers for an IPO  according to two people familiar with the matter   Those that wanted to go out in January  now they re stuck   Jensen said  Coupa declined to comment  Twilio and Okta did not respond to requests for comment  In 2014  there were two tech IPOs in January and February  according to market intelligence firm Ipreo  Last year  a slow year for deals  there was still one deal in January  Even after this year got off to a rocky start  with low oil prices sending the stock market lower  many tech companies and bankers had bet on the IPO window opening in the second quarter  Now  those involved in bringing deals to market are worried that might not happen   It s quite possible that we will have volatility for the remainder of the year   said Nate Gallon  a partner who leads IPO deals for law firm Hogan Lovells   People are bracing themselves   Companies face risks if they wait longer than six months between filing for an IPO and listing  Investors can lose interest  management teams can lose momentum and the offering can become anticlimactic  said Karim Anani  IPO west region leader for consulting firm EY  VOLATILITY INDEX WARNING To be sure  the U S  stock market could stabilize and recover   it rallied on Friday   and a rebound in technology stock prices would increase the appeal of an IPO for companies like Nutanix  But experts say the number of public tech companies scaling back their revenue growth forecasts  bloated valuations in the private market and concern that the global economy is still on very shaky ground have created roadblocks  IPO advisers say a company should not go public when the volatility index  or VIX  which measures the market s expectation of price volatility  is above 20  The index has closed above 20 every day but two so far this year  Last year  it only closed above that level 42 times  Securities analysts are concerned that market conditions will also be roiled later in the year by concerns over who will win the U S  presidential election and what their budget and tax policies will be  especially if Donald Trump is the Republican candidate or Bernie Sanders gets the Democrats  nomination  Further eroding investor confidence is the weak performance of tech IPOs from the last couple of years  Of the 87 tech IPOs that debuted over 2014 2015  about 80 percent are underwater from their IPO price  Payments technology company  First Data Corp   N FDC   the biggest IPO of 2015  fell as much as 21 percent on Wednesday after missing earnings estimates  It closed Friday at  9 44  a 41 percent drop from its IPO price  Big data company Hortonworks  O HDP  this month tried to sell shares at  16 57 in a follow on offer and ended up getting only enough demand to price at  9 50  according to Ipreo  Its shares ended Friday at  8 43  against a  16 IPO price

10174,231689,NDAQ,LSE Deutsche Boerse merger would signal end to exchange mega deals,news,By Huw Jones LONDON  Reuters    If the merger between  London Stock Exchange   L LSE  and Deutsche Boerse  DE DB1Gn  goes ahead  it could be the final mega deal in the industry as further combinations of such scale are likely to hit antitrust buffers  The two companies will seek to overcome the kind of regulatory concerns that scuppered Deutsche Boerse s attempt to merge with NYSE  Euronext  four years ago  a deal blocked because it would have created a near monopoly on exchange traded derivatives in Europe  They could argue there is less overlap between certain business lines in any one region  namely Europe  say industry experts  for example while Deutsche Boerse has a big European derivatives trading operation  LSE is largely absent from that business   If the deal is cleared it would create a  Big Four  of trading powerhouses that outstrip rivals in terms of market value and global reach   ICE  N ICE  and CME  O CME  in the United States  LSE DB in Europe and Asia s Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing  HK 0388   Each would have such large global operations in shares and derivatives trading  as well as indices and clearing  that any argument that business lines do not overlap could not prevail again  say industry officials and analysts   The very big players are already starting to be in danger of running into antitrust anywhere they go   said Patrick Young  a consultant to exchanges since the days of the first LSE Deutsche Boerse tie up proposal back in 2000   We are coming to the point where the great exchanges merger game is coming to an end  the great powers have been defined   Regulators would be unlikely to allow the CME and ICE to merge  for instance  given a combined group would have a near unassailable position in U S  securities trading  It is also unlikely that ICE would be allowed to buy a combined LSE Deutsche Boerse group as this would create an effective monopoly of listed derivatives trading in Europe  say analysts  It would also be hard to envisage the Chinese government allowing a foreign exchange take over Hong Kong Exchanges   Clearing  they said  SMALLER PREY If the LSE deal goes ahead  any big exchange looking to expand might instead have to look to hoovering up smaller peers   There is no one else left to buy up  It would be a range of mega exchanges buying a couple of selective  medium sized exchanges   said Brian Taylor of BTA Consulting  which advises exchanges  In Europe  smaller exchanges themselves such as Euronext  PA ENX  and BME  MC BME  would be forced to respond to the increased competition from a combined LSE Deutsche Boerse to avoid being squeezed out  said Christian Voigt  senior regulatory adviser in London at Fidessa  which builds trading systems   All those medium sized exchange groups     will be forced to find an answer   he said   If you are stuck in such a position  you either have to start to grow or focus on a niche or specialty areas so that you can differentiate yourself   A source close to France based Euronext  which was split from NYSE in 2014  said continuing with its strategy of maintaining its independence was no longer tenable  even if the LSE Deutsche Boerse merger did not go ahead  Euronext and Spain s BME declined to comment  A London Frankfurt merger could also pose problems for U S  exchange Nasdaq  O NDAQ   It would risk falling further and further behind a Big Four as it does not have the same global reach or a strong presence in derivatives trading and clearing   among the industry s highest growth and margin businesses    I do think that  LSE DB  would be pretty much the last of the mega mergers and poses an interesting question for Nasdaq  Do they need to do a deal  what is their focus   said Rich Daniels  senior analyst at TABB Group in New York  Nasdaq declined to comment   Until the slowdown in China s economy  Asia was seen as a promised land for western exchanges wanting to tap the region s growth and realize a dream of becoming truly global platforms   However national political barriers make foreign takeovers in Asia more difficult than elsewhere  BTA Consulting s Taylor said  In 2011 Australia banned an attempt by the Singapore Exchange to buy the Australian Stock Exchange to avoid a foreign country having too much sway in its financial center  Analysts say Asian exchanges are more likely to snap up western peers rather than the other way round  The Hong Kong Exchanges   Clearing bought the London Metal Exchange in 2012  while Singapore s SGX exchange is among the suitors for London s Baltic Exchange   I don t think any country in Asia is ready to open up to foreign ownership   TABB Group s Daniels said   I don t think that politically it is time for Asia to be part of truly global consolidation   CLEARING   BREXIT The proposed London Frankfurt merger has not yet been formally put to regulators  but a major area of competition concern could be derivatives clearing  as LSE s LCH Clearnet and Deutsche Boerse s Eurex Clearing are already the dominant players in Europe  Industry experts said the British company could spin off the French half of its clearing house in a bid to assuage regulators   LSE and Deutsche Boerse declined to comment  A core reform from the global financial crisis is forcing large chunks of the world s  550 trillion derivatives market to pass through a clearing house to complete the trade even if one side of the transaction goes bust  The lucrative service becomes mandatory for interest rate swaps in the European Union from June  and ICE and CME have both opened clearing houses in the region in the past five years   A DB LSE tie up

10188,231703,NDAQ,Betting on blockchain  firms seek fortune in bitcoin s plumbing  ,news,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON  Reuters    A year ago  bitcoin was widely dismissed as little more than a way for drug dealers and terrorists to move money around anonymously  Now  some of the world s biggest banks and companies are buying into the technology behind it 
Underlying the controversial web based  cryptocurrency  is the blockchain   a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers 
But the data that can be secured by the blockchain is not restricted to bitcoin transactions  Any two parties could use it to exchange other information  including stock deals  legal contracts and property records  within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it 
Backers say it could cut out the middleman and help fight corruption  as the process by which the data is secured makes it virtually impossible to tamper with  Banks reckon it could save them money by making their operations faster  more efficient and more transparent 
But these are early days   bitcoin was invented just six years ago   and the blockchain is still being experimented with  As is often the case with new technology  as when Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  released the iPad  it is not clear what problem it solves 
Peter Kirby  CEO of Texas blockchain focused start up Factom  likened the technology s stage of development to that of the internet in the early 1990s  when it was seen as little more than a way to send emails 
 Here we are again in the email for the internet era  and everyone s like   Oh  it s all about moving money through the world   No  It s about a giant distributed ledger that you can write anything to and never unwrite it  
Factom is using the blockchain to build a permanent and secure land title record in Honduras  one of the poorest countries in Latin America  where land grabbing and corruption are rife 
SHARED LEDGER
Every 10 minutes  a  block  of bitcoin transactions is verified by thousands of computers  mainly in places where the substantial energy needed to power them is cheap  such as China and Iceland  That block of data is then layered on top of the previous one to form a  chain  
Because the ledger thus created is shared by all of them  if anyone wants to go back and change any of the data  they would have to change every single copy of it  making the blockchain all but tamper proof 
That also solves the problem of money being spent more than once  something that has plagued earlier attempts to create digital currencies  This is an advance that makes the blockchain a  key technological innovation   according to the Bank of England  which has a dedicated team looking into the technology 
In June  U S  exchange operator Nasdaq  O NDAQ  said it was exploring new ways for shares to be issued and transferred  while Reuters disclosed earlier this year that  IBM   NYSE IBM  was looking at creating a digital cash and payment system using the blockchain 
BANKING ON THE BLOCKCHAIN
In recent months  major banks such as UBS   Barclays   LONDON BARC   ING  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and BNY Mellon have announced ventures into blockchain technology 
The potential for transactions to be settled in minutes  rather than days  with fraud or hacking almost impossible  is drawing banks in  That  and the desire not to be left behind 
 We d rather disrupt ourselves before somebody else does   said ING s global head of transaction services  Mark Buitenhek 
 Our approach     is just to start doing it  and in a year s time  we ll see   he said   If it takes off  it takes off  and if it doesn t  it doesn t  
With banks under increased regulatory scrutiny  the ability to prove via an immutable record that their trillions of dollars of daily transactions have been carried out in clients  best interests  not just their own  could prove invaluable 

 The spin offs from bitcoin are limitless   said Adam Vaziri  a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association   Using the blockchain  will  avoid any manipulation of records  ",2015-07-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/betting-on-blockchain:-firms-seek-fortune-in-bitcoin's-plumbing-352413,352413

10214,231729,NDAQ,Nasdaq market share drops in fee and rebate cutting experiment ,news,By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    Nasdaq OMX Group  O NDAQ  said on Friday its experiment in lowering exchange fees and rebates in 14 stocks has so far led to lower market share in those names on its exchange as many electronic market making firms sought higher rebates elsewhere  The experiment  which began on Feb  2 and will run for at least four months  includes 14 stocks that had their associated fees lowered on Nasdaq s exchange to 5 cents per 100 shares from 30 cents per 100 shares  and their rebates cut to 4 cents per 100 shares from 29 cents per 100 shares  Stock exchanges pay rebates as incentives to market makers that post resting orders on both sides of the best bid and offer in order to help get trades done for other market participants  When a broker sends an order to the exchange to be immediately executed and it hits a resting order  the broker is charged a fee that subsidizes the rebate  But many retail brokers  fund companies and institutional investors have complained that exchange fees are too high  forcing them to send their orders to private  broker run trading venues that charge less than public exchanges   Nasdaq said in a report detailing the first month of its pricing experiment that it lost market share in all but two of the 14 stocks as market makers provided 16 8 percent fewer resting orders in those names overall on Nasdaq s exchange  The shares also trade on other exchanges  such as BATS Global Markets and Intercontinental Exchange s  N ICE  NYSE unit  which are not part of the Nasdaq initiative  When the rebate seeking firms pulled back from Nasdaq  Investment Technology Group  N ITG   a brokerage that caters to institutional investors  said it began receiving better order executions at Nasdaq and it actually increased the amount of orders for the test stocks it sent to the exchange   ITG said its order routing algorithms look for the markets that fill their orders the fastest and most completely  and do not take fees and rebates into account   The brokerage community  if interested in improving performance on behalf of their clients  should pay heed   ITG said in a note to clients on Friday  Nasdaq plans to release data each month during the experiment to show how market participants are adapting to the change in pricing ,2015-03-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nasdaq-market-share-drops-in-fee-and-rebate-cutting-experiment-331269,331269

10221,231736,NDAQ,U S  SEC to enact rules to protect exchanges  dark pools from glitches,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch  WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  regulators are poised to adopt new rules that would require stock exchanges and some larger trading platforms to take steps to protect against market disruptions such as technology glitches or natural disasters   The Securities and Exchange Commission s rule  slated for a public vote later Wednesday morning  was sparked by a series of major blunders over the past several years  from Nasdaq OMX s  O NDAQ  botched handling of Facebook s  O FB  initial public offering to the shutdown of the stock market during Hurricane Sandy   The SEC s rule  known as  Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity  or Reg SCI for short  would replace the current regulatory model in which exchanges rely on voluntary guidance to address security and stability issues with their systems   It will require exchanges  certain alternative trading platforms including some  dark pool  venues  and several self regulatory groups to establish and enforce policies to ensure their systems are resilient and secure   Under the new rules  they will also be required to conduct annual reviews for compliance and submit them to senior management for feedback   The rule was first proposed in early 2013  but efforts to complete it were dogged by disagreements on Wall Street and at the SEC over its scope and some of its provisions   Stock exchanges and some SEC commissioners were upset that the initial plan did not capture more large broker dealers who match investors  orders internally   They pointed to the near collapse of Knight Capital  a brokerage that experienced a technological glitch and suffered a  461 million loss  as an example for why more firms should be covered by the rule  Knight was later rescued by Getco  and is now known as KCG Holdings  N KCG   In addition  SEC Democratic Commissioner Luis Aguilar had previously raised concerns about whether the rule had enough teeth and went far enough toward holding exchanges and their top executives accountable   In prepared remarks Wednesday  Aguilar said the final rule has come a long way since then  and that he is glad it has been tightened to include a minimum set of testing standards and a requirement for management to review the annual compliance reports

10230,231745,NDAQ,Exchanges issue summary of data processor meeting for first time,news,"By Herbert Lash NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  stock exchanges have posted online details about the management of data processors that have sparked embarrassing trading glitches and accusations of shoddy disclosure by releasing minutes from an oversight meeting for the first time 
Two committees made up of representatives from 14 exchanges and brokerage watchdog the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  FINRA  recently published a two page summary of a general session meeting of the committees on Oct  22 
Critics  most notably the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  SIFMA   a lobby for banks  brokerages and asset managers  have urged better governance of the committees  which oversee several securities information processors  SIPs  
The SIPs provide the latest sale price and quotations for stocks and options  a critical but little noticed role in the daily functioning of the stock market until a three hour trading halt in Nasdaq stocks in August 2013  That outage  and several others  made SIP reliability a key concern for the Securities and Exchange Commission 
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc agreed to improve operational metrics after winning a bid to manage the SIP for Nasdaq listed stocks last week  The contract also provides reliability guidelines that were lacking in the past 
But the months long selection process  which appeared mired in a stalemate  drew criticism because of a dearth of details 
A Nasdaq spokesman said the information was posted Oct  31  while an announcement by the Consolidated Tape Association  CTA   which oversees stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and an affiliate exchange  said the minutes went up Nov  4 
The CTA said the posting was part of  an effort to provide the industry with more detailed information that improves transparency and serves as a useful informational tool  
The online posting noted the names of five people who form an advisory committee  including a representative from Thomson Reuters Corp  But the names of the representatives from the exchanges were omitted  as was the SEC s representative 
A picture of the advisory committee members also was posted 
The posting highlighted agenda items typical of the committees  quarterly meetings  such as data on SIP performance and a review of system subscribers  information that has been published online for several years 
The summary also indicated reports on disaster recovery operations for the exchanges  data centers  and quarterly testing dates  The last test was Sept  27  and the next Dec  6 
There was no immediate comment from SIFMA

10239,231754,NDAQ,Alibaba expected to rise more than 30 percent in trading debut,news,"By Liana B  Baker  Jessica Toonkel and Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK  Reuters    Alibaba Group Holding Ltd s  N BABA  shares are expected to surge in their first day of trading on Friday as many investors that received fewer shares than hoped lined up orders to buy what looks likely to be the largest IPO in history 
Floor traders at the New York Stock Exchange were getting set for the stock to begin trading  with the exchange continuing to match millions of share orders  Indications were for the stock to begin trading between  91 and  92 a share  a more than 30 percent increase from its  68 initial public offering price 
The pricing on Thursday initially raised  21 8 billion for the Chinese e commerce company  Scott Cutler  head of the New York Stock Exchange s global listing business  told CNBC that underwriters would exercise their option for an additional 48 million shares  to bring the IPO s size to about  25 billion  making it the largest IPO in history 
 This is the biggest IPO the world has ever seen  so there s a celebratory mood on the floor  whether you like it or not   said Benedict Willis  director of floor operations at Sunrise Securities Corp on the NYSE floor 
Alibaba is nearly unknown to most Americans but is ubiquitous in China  where it is responsible for 80 percent of online sales  The company earned  3 7 billion in the 12 months ended March 31  2014  up about  2 billion from the prior 12 month period 
The sale values the company at about  168 billion  more than American icons such as Walt Disney Co  N DIS  and Coca Cola Co  N KO   Should the stock close at  90 on its first day  it would be worth about  220 billion  nearly the value of Procter   Gamble Co  N PG  
Jack Ma  a former English teacher  founded Alibaba in 1999 in his apartment  His personal fortune is more than  14 billion on paper  vaulting him into the ranks of such tech billionaires as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos  The deal is also expected to make millionaires out of a substantial chunk of the company s managers  software engineers and other staff 
Alibaba s shares met with intense demand from investors  with 35 and 40 institutions each placing orders for  1 billion or more in shares  The big increase expected in shares would exceed the gain by U S  IPOs in the second quarter  which rose an average 9 2 percent in their first day of trading  according to Renaissance Capital IPO Intelligence 
Mark Hawtin  portfolio manager of the GAM Star Technology Strategy  a portfolio for offshore investors  said he was excited about how Alibaba priced and was hoping to buy more shares at the open  However  he said he will not pay more than  90  A number of other investors suggested their threshold was about  90 as well 
One institutional investor who had been told he was going to get one of the top allocations only received one third of his order  and said he planned on buying more as long as the stock was trading below  90 a share   I was told everyone is disappointed   he said   I have cooled off now  
 We did put in for the IPO and we are getting an allocation  though not the full allocation we put in for  We probably got about 10 percent of that   said Michael Matousek  head trader at U S  Global Investors Inc in San Antonio 
J J  Kinahan  chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade  said the firm is seeing customer orders amounting to about 70 percent of what it saw for Facebook  and about three times the customer orders it had for Twitter s IPO 
Alibaba Group s orange banners were festooned around the exchange  with its logo on NYSE computer screens  Ma was on hand at the trading floor to watch several long time customers ring the opening bell at the exchange 
 I don t want disappointed shareholders  I want to make sure they make money   Ma said of the pricing  on CNBC  adding that he worries most when customers are happy 
With underwriters electing to sell more shares  the company s initial public offering becomes the largest in history  surpassing Agricultural Bank of China Ltd s  SS 601288   22 1 billion listing in 2010 
NYSE held extensive tests to ensure it would be able to handle heavy trading volume and kept a call going on Friday with periodic updates to note the indicated price range and to say that systems were working properly 

Alibaba chose the NYSE over rival exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group Inc  O NDAQ  to list its shares in part because it worried about Nasdaq s ability to handle a massive IPO after Facebook Inc s botched market debut in 2012

10241,231756,NDAQ,Exclusive  MSCI global indices may include Alibaba after investor queries,news,"By Jessica Toonkel  Reuters    Stock index provider MSCI Inc  N MSCI  is considering changing its rules to allow shares of Alibaba Group Holding  IPO BABA N  and other companies that list their shares in faraway markets to be included in its widely used indexes 
The MSCI announced that it was considering changing its rules last week  but did not explain the reason for the changes  questions from investors amid the Alibaba initial public offering  Reuters has learned from financial industry sources 
The investors argued that MSCI s ignoring stocks such as Alibaba prevents them from accurately tracking the performance of international companies  according to sources involved in the discussions  who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media 
Alibaba  a Chinese online retailer  plans to sell some  24 billion worth of shares next week on the New York Stock Exchange in a listing that could be the biggest ever IPO 
Under MSCI s rules  a company cannot be included in its biggest indexes if it is based in one region and its shares are listed in a different region  Because Alibaba is not listed anywhere in Asia and is listing in New York  it would be excluded from big MSCI indexes 
Any changes to the MSCI rules will probably have to wait until at least March 2015  according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media 
An MSCI spokeswoman declined to comment 
The rule changes under consideration could result in investors pouring billions of dollars into shares of companies like Alibaba and Chinese online search engine Baidu Inc   O BIDU 
Funds that track the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets index and manage some  210 billion could be forced to buy Alibaba shares when the rules change  Funds with some  1 3 trillion in assets aim to duplicate the performance of the MSCI Global Investable Market indexes 
The top 30 companies by market value that could be added to MSCI indexes if rules change include besides Alibaba and Baidu  also Italian fashion company Prada SpA  which lists its shares in Hong Kong  and Samsonite International SA  a luggage company founded in the United States but listed in Hong Kong 
The total market value of those 30 companies  excluding Alibaba  is just over  410 billion  Alibaba s expected market value is  160 billion Under current rules  Alibaba does not qualify for inclusion in any major global indexes from any provider  although it does qualify for smaller indexes 
FUND PRESSURE
Institutional investors have also pressured another major international index provider  FTSE Group  to consider changing its rules to include companies that only list abroad  the sources said 
FTSE reiterated on Thursday that under its current rules  Alibaba would not be added to its Global Equity Index Series  which includes its well known FTSE Emerging Markets Index 
Those indexes exclude shares from companies that have American Depository Receipts on a U S  exchange  but no underlying listed shares in their local markets 
But a spokesman added that the index provider keeps updating its rules based on investor feedback  FTSE said it relied on external advisory committees to ensure that users  views and any other practical considerations were taken into account 
Alibaba will be included in five smaller FTSE indexes  However  some fund executives believe that FTSE may change its rules if MSCI does  FTSE Group is a unit of the London Stock Exchange Group  L LSE 
Investors have raised this issue with index providers before  but the upcoming Alibaba IPO has brought it to a head  one of the sources said 
 MSCI wants to make sure that its indexes are a good measure of the market performance  It s a bigger issue than just Alibaba  but the Alibaba IPO is a symptom of this problem   said another fund executive 
Dennis Hudachek  a senior specialist with ETF com  an expert on exchange traded funds said several major Internet companies listed in the United States but based in China were affected by current index rules 
 But make no mistake about it  this is not a coincidence that they are announcing this consultation weeks before the  Alibaba  IPO       
Alibaba does not meet the criteria for other major indexes that U S  investors track  the Standard   Poor s 500 Index is only for U S  based companies  for example  and the Nasdaq 100 is only for shares listed on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc s  O NDAQ  exchange  

MSCI said on Sept 4 that it was soliciting feedback on possible rule changes  and is seeking feedback by Nov 28

10257,231772,NDAQ,Exclusive  U S  options exchanges craft rules to fend off turmoil,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    A year after Goldman Sachs  N GS  bungled a software upgrade and lost tens of millions of dollars from unintended trades  the 12 U S  stock options exchanges have crafted new rules for dealing with erroneous transactions  according to draft documents seen by Reuters 
Under the proposed rules  unintended trades placed by professional traders will usually have their prices adjusted to levels as close to their fair market value as possible  while wrong trades by retail customers will be mainly be undone  five sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
The rules are meant to protect investors from algorithms gone wild and other sources of market turmoil  Regulators and exchange operators across equities  commodities and other markets have been taking steps to prevent mistaken trades from spiraling into collapses  a rising concern as trading grows increasingly automated 
When market prices are oscillating wildly  technical glitches can create turmoil  said Andy Nybo  head of derivatives research at advisory firm TABB Group 
 A cohesive solution for the industry is critical to get in place before we have another technology blowup   he said 
In other markets  technical glitches have created big trouble for traders  Knight Capital Group  a stock trading firm now known as KCG Holdings Inc  lost  461 1 million in August 2012 from new software that was improperly installed  The loss forced the company to seek  400 million of rescue capital and eventually led to its sale to a rival firm 
But critics say the new stock option trading rules are hardly perfect  Participants often don t know whether they are trading with a professional or a retail investor  If markets start surging or plunging unexpectedly  traders have no way of knowing if their positions will disappear  or be adjusted 
That uncertainty could result in many traders exiting a choppy market just when they are most needed  said Thomas Peterffy  founder and head of Interactive Brokers  O IBKR   a brokerage and options market maker 
 All of the liquidity goes out of the marketplace and then it will never recover   he said  Although listed stock options markets are a fraction of the size of U S  equities market  derivatives exchanges are seen as a crucial tool for dealers and other market participants to offload risk from the stock market 
The proposed rules come at the behest of U S  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White  who last September ordered the heads of the exchanges to take specific steps to make the cash equities and options markets more sound  including a unified rule for obvious errors for options trades 
Exchanges have been fine tuning the plan with the help of the SEC since June  and expect to file it with the regulator in four to six weeks  according to one of the people  All of the sources asked to remain anonymous because the details are not yet public 
Once the plan is filed with the SEC  it will be made available for public comment  which will later be reviewed by the regulator before deciding on whether to approve the rule 
Options exchange operators NYSE  which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   Nasdaq OMX Group  O NDAQ   BATS Global Markets  CBOE Holdings  O CBOE   International Securities Exchange  owned by Deutsche Boerse  DE DB1Gn   and BOX Options Exchange  owned by TMX Group  TO X   declined to comment for this story  as did the SEC  Miami International Holdings Inc did not respond to a request for comment 
 
ONE PROBLEM  A DOZEN SETS OF RULES
Options trade across a dozen different exchanges  and each exchange has its own rules for how to deal with mistaken trades 
Those differing rules can create trouble  In August 2013  Goldman s software snafu resulted in its flooding stock options markets with bad trades  pushing the prices of some options down sharply 
When Goldman Sachs said the transactions were erroneous  some exchanges canceled the positions  and some did not  Traders that had bought an option from Goldman on one exchange and sold the same position on another could have found themselves holding an option they thought they had sold  Goldman s losses would have been far greater had most of the trades not been canceled 
In crafting rules for dealing with mistaken trades  exchanges had originally planned to adjust most obviously erroneous trades  said three people familiar with the matter  But retail brokers objected  and said that their customers tend to make mistakes that professionals don t  such as buying or selling a completely different option from what they had intended to trade 
Allowing different treatment for professional traders versus retail investors seemed like a middle ground  the sources said  Retail trading accounted for 24 3 percent of options market volume in the first half  according to TABB Group 
Under the rules  a trade is deemed obviously erroneous if its price differs dramatically from the market level for that option soon before and after the transaction was executed  But the rules also allow market participants to change trades that were harmed by unexpected market movements that had nothing to do with technical glitches  a trade can be deemed obviously mistaken even if the price movement that triggered the trade was just a market gyration after a surprising event 
After the proposed rules are in place  the exchanges will then consider a second phase of coordination  including appointing a single  uniform source for determining the theoretical prices of options  something that each of the exchanges now does on its own  three of the sources said  The exchanges will also look at implementing a system similar to one in the stock markets where options would be prevented from trading outside a range based on recent prices  the people said 

The exchanges have given themselves leeway in the rules that would allow them to cancel all erroneous trades for all participants if they think that doing so would lead to getting the market back to a normal state as quickly as possible

 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK  May 2  Reuters    U S  stocks slipped on Monday 
as an early bounce on Osama bin Laden s death gave way to
questions around the longevity of the market s recent rally 
 The impact of bin Laden s death by U S  forces on financial
markets prompted a quick flurry of buying  which was viewed as
an emotional response  The Dow swung 92 points from its high of
the day to its low 
  His death should not have affected the markets much    
 but  just people feeling a little better about the world
sometimes impacts the stock market   said Bryant Evans 
investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset
Management  in Champaign  Illinois 
 Energy and materials were the weakest performers  Investors
pulled back from shares that have outperformed lately following
declines in commodities  The S P energy index was down 1 3
percent 
 U S  crude prices ended lower but were off the sharp
declines that immediately followed word of the al Qaeda
leader s killing  and silver dipped after a recent rally 
 Monday s fall followed the Dow s and Nasdaq s posting their
best monthly gains since December  and analysts forecast little
resistance for the S P 500 until 1 400 
  We ve seen a great stock market this year  and that shows
you that the broader economy is what s important   Evans said 
 Stocks also were helped by merger and acquisition
announcements  which often reflect optimism about the
longer term outlook  The S P 500 is up 30 percent since the
start of September  roughly when the current rally began 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 3 18 points  or

 LONDON  May 16  Reuters    European shares closed lower on
Monday with banks most exposed to peripheral euro zone debt
pressured by the region s debt crisis as finance ministers meet
to discuss further austerity steps for Greece 
 A late session rebound in heavyweight British listed miners
 limited losses  however  as bargain hunters emerged
to lift the mining index from a two month low 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300  index of top
shares closed 0 2 percent lower at 1 138 74 points  with thin
volume    just 72 percent of its 90 day average    seen
exaggerating moves

chief Dominique Strauss Kahn for attempted rape initially raised
concerns about the impact of this case on euro zone aid talks

 Euro zone finance ministers are expected to approve the
EU IMF bailout of Portugal later on Monday  and will also

targets   ID nLDE74F0XV 
 Sources said EU and IMF inspectors would tell euro zone
finance ministers they were not yet happy with Greece s proposed
budget steps and that more talks were needed on fiscal and
privatisation plans 
  Considering the fragility of sentiment towards what may be
down the road for Greece  investors are keeping an eye out for
what will come out of the meeting for indications that they re
willing to work with Greece around restructuring and any calls
for further austerity   City Index strategist Joshua Raymond
said 
 Banks exposed to peripheral euro zone debt were among the
top fallers on the index  with Commerzbank   Credit
Agricole  and National Bank of Greece  down
1 3 to 3 5 percent 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel  however  seemed to rule out
restructuring by saying restructuring for any euro zone country
before 2013 would be  incredibly  damaging to the credibility of
the bloc  giving the euro a lift  although European banks
remained under pressure   ID nLDE74F1OY

 TECHNICALS SEEN SUPPORTING 
 In a positive trend for equities  the Euro STOXX 50 index
    the euro zone s blue chip index    held above the
support level of the 200 day moving average at 2 856 16 points
after testing that level earlier in the session 
 The index closed 0 5 percent lower at 2 881 31 points 
 Analysts said the index is unlikely to fall further in the
short term as long as it remains above that support level  but
it is also not expected to make significant gains as the summer
months of low volumes approach 
  Prices should bottom above this moving average to leave the
short term sideways picture intact   said Roelof Jan Van den

  A close below this moving average suggests a test of the

10281,231796,NDAQ,UPDATE 2 NYSE  D Boerse mull payouts to win support,news,"  Several payout options weighed to fend off Nasdaq ICE bid
   Special dividend  share buybacks being considered
   NYSE  D Boerse identified additional cost savings
  Adds background  details 
 By Paritosh Bansal and Jonathan Spicer
 NEW YORK  April 13  Reuters    NYSE Euronext  and
Deutsche Boerse AG  are weighing several options to
win support for their  10 2 billion deal  including paying
special dividends to shareholders  three sources briefed on the
matter said on Wednesday 
 NYSE could give its own shareholders a special dividend at
the time the Deutsche Boerse deal closes  sources said 
 Other options include NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse
together buying back shares or paying a dividend after the deal
is completed  one of the sources said 
 The idea is to win shareholder support for the NYSE
Euronext Deutsche Boerse combination over a higher but
unsolicited offer for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX Group
 and IntercontinentalExchange Inc  
 While NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse currently pay
dividends  Nasdaq and ICE do not 
 Rating agencies have raised concerns about Nasdaq s debt
levels  Moody s Investors Service said earlier this month the
bid made it more likely to cut Nasdaq s debt ratings to junk
over the medium term  while Standard   Poor s said it might cut
the exchange s ratings to junk in the near term 
 Two junk ratings could create a headache for the combined
exchange because NYSE bondholders would have the right to force
the company to buy back their  2 1 billion of debt  Nasdaq
could be forced to raise even more money 
 Still  Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld has said that
it would consider dividends as a way to return capital to
shareholders if its bid for NYSE Euronext was successful 
 NYSE  Nasdaq  and Deutsche Boerse declined to comment  The
sources requested anonymity because the talks are not public 
 SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
 Executives from all four exchange operators have met with
shareholders to press their cases in the last few days 
 The options being considered by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche
Boerse are in part based on those meetings  one of the sources
said 
 Further highlighting their desire to fend off an
unsolicited bid  NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse have also
identified additional cost savings from their planned
combination  one of the sources said 
 Nasdaq and ICE bid  11 3 billion to buy and divide the
centuries old NYSE between them  The offer was a 12 percent
premium to Deutsche Boerse s acquisition plan  unveiled in
February 
 NYSE s board dismissed the counteroffer on Sunday as too
risky and contrary to the company s strategy  though NYSE
shareholders will likely have to decide between the competing
offers 
 Under the Deutsche Boerse deal  the shareholders of the
German exchange operator would get 60 percent of the combined
entity  while NYSE Euronext holders would get the rest 
 Deutsche Boerse does not want to change that split  one of
the sources said 
 NYSE Euronext s shares closed up 1 1 percent  while Nasdaq
was off 0 1 percent and ICE was up 0 6 percent  Deutsche Boerse
closed up 0 1 percent in Germany

   Nasdaq ICE may launch hostile bid for NYSE Euronext
   Deutsche Boerse shares rise 1 1 percent
 
   Recasts  adds detail  background 
 FRANKFURT  April 11  Reuters    Deutsche Boerse has no plans
to raise its offer for NYSE Euronext  two people said on Monday 
even as the global merger dance among exchange operators looked
set to continue 
 The operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange is preparing to
file an offer document with German regulator BaFin as early as
Tuesday  these people  who are familiar with Deutsche Boerse s
thinking  said 
 After that  Deutsche Boerse will go on a roadshow as it
seeks to convince NYSE Euronext shareholders that a deal between
Frankfurt and New York is the best offer  these people said 
 Deutsche Boerse declined to comment 
 The boards of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have not
been on a joint roadshow since Nasdaq OMX Group  together with
IntercontinentalExchange  ICE   presented an  11 3 billion offer
that rivals Deutsche Boerse s offer valuing the company at  10
billion at current share prices 
 NYSE Euronext s board of directors on Sunday unanimously
rejected the Nasdaq ICE offer  saying it was too risky and
counter to the Big Board s vision 
 Deutsche Boerse shares rose as investors saw the chances of
a bidding war between rival suitors diminished  The stock was up
1 1 percent by 1457 GMT  while Germany s blue chip index was
down 0 1 percent 
 But sources said on Monday that Nasdaq and ICE may press
ahead in what would be a hostile offer for NYSE Euronext 
 Analysts said any hostile takeover of NYSE Euronext would be
difficult since the company s current management would have to
be forced out 
  NYSE Euronext s governance rules don t allow shareholders
to call a meeting and run a new slate of board members  and it
is too late to propose a new slate for the April 28th meeting 
making the 2012 meeting the first opportunity to run a new
slate   Macquarie equities research said in a note 
 But Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext still had a lot of
lobby work to do to prevent a rival offer from succeeding 
analysts said 
  We don t think many investors will find the differences in
strategic vision  financial leverage  employment targets etc  as
sufficient reasons to decline the nominally superior Nasdaq ICE
offer   Macquarie further said 
  NYSE s rejection of a rival offer is very positive  given
that a failure of the merger with NYSE Euronext would have left
Deutsche Boerse internationally isolated   said Heino Ruland of
Ruland Research 
 Christian Muschick at Silvia Quandt research said he saw
NYSE Euronext s move as increasing the chances of a successful
merger with Deutsche Boerse merger 
 Deutsche Boerse on Sunday welcomed the news saying   NYSE
Euronext and Deutsche Boerse will create compelling value for
shareholders of both companies  
NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer criticised
Nasdaq s unsolicited bid  saying it would unacceptably carve up

 NEW YORK  April 24  Reuters    NYSE Euronext sees
cost savings in its  9 8 billion deal with Deutsche Boerse
 at closer to 400 million euros   583 million   up by
about a third from its initial estimate  according to a Big
Board spokesman on Sunday 	
 NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer also sees the biggest
NYSE and Deutsche Boerse customers saving at least  3 billion
from the combination of their European derivatives platforms 
according to spokesman Richard Adamonis 	
 Adamonis was confirming comments made earlier by Niederauer
in an interview with the Financial Times 	
 The new savings estimate  along with a 100 million euros in
benefits coming from cross selling and distribution
opportunities  would bring the total savings and benefits from
the deal to about  725 million  closer to the estimates from a
competing takeover offer 	
 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange
Inc have launched a rival  11 2 billion takeover bid for
NYSE Euronext  That deal promises net savings and benefits  or
synergies  of  740 million 	
 Last week  NYSE s board rejected the Nasdaq ICE bid for the
second time in 11 days   ID nN21261185 	
 
 JOB CUTS	
 U S  Sen  Charles Schumer of New York was expected to ask
Nasdaq and ICE about potential job losses if they succeeded in
their bid  the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday 	
 In a letter expected to be sent Monday  Schumer cited
estimates by NYSE that a merger with Nasdaq could cost 1 000
U S  jobs  or about a third of the U S  based employees of the
combined company  the Journal reported 	
 The estimates are based on NYSE s research from about 12 to
18 months ago when it looked at buying Nasdaq  the paper
reported  citing an unnamed source 	
 Earlier this month  Schumer said he was concerned about the
impact of the bid on jobs in New York 	
 A spokesman for Schumer could not be reached immediately for
comment late on Sunday 	
 The U S  lawmaker is one of the key political figures whose
support could be crucial for any deal involving NYSE  the iconic
exchange whose takeover can take on a populist hue 	
 Pride and nationalism around domestic exchanges have
scuttled such deals in the past  Earlier this month  the
Australian government blocked  Singapore Exchange Ltd s
  8 billion bid for ASX Ltd   saying changes to
the country s financial systems were needed before foreigners
could buy the bourse   ID nL3E7F73WZ 	
    In their bid  Nasdaq and ICE are hoping some of these
fears work to their advantage over the German exchange  They
have appealed heavily to the United States  thirst for remaining
the world s financial center  its anxiety about losing out on
new listings and its need for a more stable market 	
 
 SHAREHOLDER VOTES	
 All four exchanges involved in the increasingly bitter
takeover battle are trying to persuade NYSE shareholders to back
their deal 	
 Niederauer s comments come ahead of a closely watched NYSE
shareholder meeting on April 28 for their annual vote on the
company s directors 	
 Analysts have said that vote could be an early sign of how
shareholders feel about the NYSE board s decision to back the
Deutsche Boerse over the rival  higher bid

with the situation said on Thursday

board has twice rejected their  11 1 billion bid in favor of a
friendly  10 1 billion deal with Germany s Deutsche Boerse AG
 
 The tender offer would come  sooner rather than later

 NEW YORK  April 10  Reuters    Investors will look to
corporate profits and outlooks this week for confirmation the
S P 500 has another leg to its rally as the earnings season
gets under way 
 Dow component Alcoa will launch the earnings season after
the closing bell on Monday in what is expected to be another
solid round of corporate results 
 The aluminum producer is expected to report quarterly
earnings of 27 cents per share on revenue of  6 07 billion 
according to Thomson Reuters estimates 
 Some top financial names are also expected to report this
week  including JPMorgan Chase   Co and Bank of America Corp 
Google Inc is also due to report 
  Earnings are what the market is all about  Earnings are
critical in here  guidance is critical in here  the conference
calls are critical in here   said Paul Mendelsohn  chief
investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in
Charlotte  Vermont 
  In terms of earnings and sectors  you basically want to be
with those people who have the ability to raise prices or are
participating in the commodity price increases   he said   And
you really don t want to be in those people who have the input
costs increases and are going to see their margins squeezed by
rising commodity prices 
 Market analysts have found encouragement for a strong
earnings season from the relatively light amount of company
preannouncements  leading to the belief that surging commodity
costs have yet to compress margins and impact corporate
profits 
 The Reuters Jefferies CRB index rose 8 percent in the first
quarter  is up 2 6 percent so far in April  and hit its highest
level since September 2008 
 The S P 500 has recouped all of the losses suffered in the
wake of the Japanese earthquake on March 11  but has been
unable to convincingly muscle past the 1 333 58 level  a
technical resistance point representing double the 12 year low
hit on March 9  2009 
 A potential U S  government shutdown was averted late on
Friday after President Barack Obama signed a short term
spending bill following extended negotiations over the federal
budget 
 With just over an hour to spare before a midnight deadline 
Obama s Democrats and opposition Republicans agreed to a
compromise that will cut about  38 billion in spending for the
last six months of this fiscal year 
 A shutdown was considered unlikely  and the impact on
equities from the budget resolution was expected to be muted 
 Investors will also eye a batch of economic data this week 
providing more insight into the the economic recovery 
including the consumer and producer prices indexes  the
Reuters University of Michigan consumer sentiment index and the
Federal Reserve s Beige Book of economic activity 
  The inflation numbers will certainly be important   
producer price index and consumer price index    the
expectation is inflation will be higher than the Federal
Reserve will feel comfortable with   said Hugh Johnson  chief
investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany  New
York  
  The focus  this  week will clearly be on the earnings
numbers and the economic numbers and that is where the focus of
the market should be  
 On Sunday  NYSE Euronext said its board of directors
rejected an unsolicited takeover bid by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc
and IntercontinentalExchange Inc and reaffirmed its commitment
to merging with Deutsche Boerse AG 
 The company said Deutsche Boerse s  10 2 billion offer
would create  substantially more long term value  for
shareholders and called the  11 3 billion counter offer from
Nasdaq and ICE  strategically unattractive with unacceptable
execution risk

 NEW YORK  April 1  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Friday
after solid data on the labor market bred confidence in the
economic recovery and comments from a Federal Reserve Bank
president signaled support for quantitative easing 
 The combination of good news for the market pushed the S P
500 through a key technical level it has been unable to
sustain despite several attempts this month 
 U S  employment recorded a second straight month of solid
gains in March and the jobless rate fell to a two year low of
8 8 percent 
  We are growing  we are getting more profitable  we are
going to see more jobs  That means consumers are going to do
better  That is the better picture to look at   said Marc
Pado  U S  market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald   Co  in San
Francisco 
 New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley
said in response to reporters  questions in San Juan  Puerto
Rico  that it would be a  surprise  if the U S  Federal
Reserve did not complete its  600 billion in bond purchases 
though the benefits of doing more have fallen 
 The S P broke above 1 332  a significant level as it
represents double the 12 year low hit in March 2009  If the
index stays convincingly above that threshold  it may trigger
more buying 
  1 333 is really the breakout    we are making new highs
for the bull market for several indices and you will see
confirmation from the S P shortly   Pado said 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 94 68 points  or
0 77 percent  to 12 414 41  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
rose 11 27 points  or 0 85 percent  to 1 337 10  The Nasdaq
Composite Index advanced 19 86 points  or 0 71 percent  to
2 800 93 
 The S P 500 ended the first quarter on Thursday with a
gain of 5 4 percent 
 NYSE Euronext shares rallied after Nasdaq OMX Group Inc
and IntercontinentalExchange Inc unveiled a bid to buy the
rival exchanges operator  topping an earlier offer from
Deutsche Boerse AG 
 NYSE s stock surged 11 3 percent to  39 14 while ICE
shares lost 4 1 percent to  118 52 and Nasdaq OMX rose 7 2
percent to  27 69 
 In another snapshot of the economy  the U S  manufacturing
sector grew at a marginally slower pace in March after
accelerating at its fastest rate in nearly seven years in
February  according to the Institute for Supply Management 
The data had little impact on stocks

 NEW YORK  April 1  Reuters    U S  stocks started a
traditionally healthy month on strong footing on Friday after
solid jobs figures  but the S P 500 may need help to break to
new multi year highs 
 The S P hovered near 1 333  a significant level as it
represents double the 12 year low hit in March 2009  It is
close to the 1 344 representing the S P s 2011 high  its
highest since June 2008 
  There s a lot of congestion in terms of price action
around these levels and I wouldn t expect the market to break
to new highs in the next weeks   said Paul Zemsky  head of
asset allocation at ING in New York 
 Strong job growth and supportive comments on Fed policy
from influential New York Fed Bank President William Dudley
were supportive  but the market is looking to forthcoming
earnings to kick the rally into a higher gear 
 U S  employment grew solidly for a second month in March
and the jobless rate hit a two year low of 8 8 percent 
  Once we get to earnings and get confirmation companies
continue to show strength  I think we ll make new highs on the
S P  But a couple of weeks of consolidation seems like a good
thing to happen   Zemsky said 
 About 7 4 billion shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange  NYSE Amex and Nasdaq  below last year s estimated
daily average of 8 47 billion  Composite volume was the
weakest for any week so far this year 
 Dudley said quantitative easing that totaled  600 billion
in bond purchases was expected to run until June  countering
several days of hawkish rhetoric from other Federal Reserve
officials 
 The payrolls number was  a clear breakout in the trend of
job growth to the upside   said Zemsky   I think this is the
game changer in terms of giving more confidence the recovery
is going to be durable and survive the end of QE2  
 NYSE Euronext shares rallied after Nasdaq OMX Group Inc
and IntercontinentalExchange Inc unveiled a bid to buy the

 NYSE s stock surged 12 6 percent to  39 60 while ICE
shares lost 3 1 percent to  119 75 and Nasdaq OMX rose 9 3

 The Dow Jones industrial average hit 12 419 71    its
highest intraday level going back to June 2008    before
closing up 56 99 points  or 0 46 percent  at 12 376 72  The
Standard   Poor s 500 rose 6 58 points  or 0 50 percent  to
1 332 41  The Nasdaq Composite gained 8 53 points  or 0 31
percent  to 2 789 60 
 For the week  the Dow gained 1 3 percent  the S P added
1 4 percent and the Nasdaq rose 1 7 percent

10310,231825,NDAQ,DEALTALK ASX deal failure risks making SGX a takeover target,news,"  SGX seen pursuing new tie ups but Asia opportunities
limited
   Aberdeen says SGX could become a potential takeover target
   ASX growth options limited  may muscle in on LSE TMX

 By Michael Smith and Saeed Azhar	
 SYDNEY SINGAPORE  April 6  Reuters    Singapore Exchange
 CEO Magnus Bocker faces a race against time    either
find a new target after the likely demise of his  7 8 billion
bid for Australia s ASX Ltd   or risk the SGX itself
becoming prey 	
  Tuesday s comments from Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan
that he intends to reject SGX s bid for ASX on national interest
grounds has raised the prospect that the hunter may quickly
become the hunted   ID nL3E7F50PP 	
     SGX yesterday moved from being an acquirer to a potential
acquiree   said Peter Elston  a Singapore based strategist at
Aberdeen Asset Management  which owns shares in SGX and ASX  	
 SGX shares rallied 6 percent after news broke on Tuesday
that the Australian government will reject the deal  but Elston
said the company faces long term risks  SGX shares have shed
about S 1 6 billion of their value since the deal was first
announced in October  falling about 15 percent 	
  The short term merger risks have been removed that is why
the share price reacted strongly  Longer term  there are risks
of isolation and of not being able to compete with the big
boys  	
 One such big boy is the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing
   Asia s most valuable bourse operator  which some
bankers and analysts see as a possible merger partner  	
 But HKEx s sheer size and gateway to the massive China
market means there is little incentive for it to do a deal with
SGX  HKEx has a market value of  25 billion  more than
three and a half times the size of SGX 	
 The deal could also face tough regulatory scrutiny in
Singapore  where the government indirectly owns a 23 percent
non voting stake in SGX  which was the subject of much criticism
in Australia 	
 Asked on Tuesday about the prospect of SGX becoming a
target  Bocker said it was a hypothetical question 	
  We are a listed and well traded company  We will deal with
these questions when they happen and if they happen  	
	
    	
   	
 EUROPEAN PARTNER  	
 Exchanges around the world are chasing cross border deals to
build scale and cut costs amid increasing competition from dark
pools  	
    The Tokyo and Osaka exchanges are in talks  Deutsche Boerse
 is competing with a partnership of Nasdaq OMX Group
 and InterncontinentalExchange to buy NYSE
Euronext   and London Stock Exchange is looking
to combine with Canada s TMX Group        	
 Beyond Asian borders  SGX could explore a tieup with the
London Stock Exchange or team up with a weakened Deutsche Boerse
if it misses out on NYSE Euronext      	
But SGX s higher valuations would be a challenge as European
exchanges are trading at an average of 11 1 times 2012 earnings
and American exchanges at 13 3 times versus SGX s 19 times  UBS
estimated in a recent note  	
 One other potential Asian candidate is Malaysia s stock
exchange operator Bursa Malaysia which has said it is
open to partnerships to remain competitive   ID nL3E7DA0KC 	
 Other regional bourses either have ownership structures that
make deals difficult or impossible  or lack meaningful size to
be attractive partners 	
    Further afield  a long rumoured potential partner for SGX is
the Nasdaq OMX  Bocker s previous employer  but analysts now say
the prospect of strengthening that existing relationship has
been complicated by the NYSE bid 	
      We do not discount that  though it would be harder to
convince markets that it is an equal partnership   said Kenneth
Ng  analyst at CIMB 	
     Mr Bocker s track record was previously forged from merging
Scandinavian exchanges into OMX before selling it to Nasdaq 
Ideally  the best option would be to consolidate ASEAN exchanges
before looking to consolidate at the next level  	
 
 ASX OPTIONS	
 The growth options for Australia s ASX  which faces
competition on its home turf for the first time later this year
and the departure of its chief executive Rob Elstone in July 
look less promising 	
    One source told Reuters on Wednesday the ASX does not have a
definitive Plan B if the Singapore bid fails although it had
held talks with other exchanges in the past 	
     No one else will bother speaking to the ASX after this  
one investment banker said 	
      Can the ASX buy anything  Well  it s not great if your
government has said foreigners aren t allowed to buy them and
then you go to a foreign country and go to their government and
say is it ok if we buy you  	
    Analysts say it would be logical for the ASX to muscle in on
the LSE and TMX deal given their exposure to the resources
sector 	
     The three share a common language  legal system and
strength in mining and materials listings  and would span all
three major global time zones   New York based Rosenblatt
Securities Inc managing director Justin Schack said 	
     Such a deal might be better received by the Aussie
government  as ASX is currently the biggest of these three
companies   	
    The ASX has made it clear it still wants to participate in
consolidation in the region and globally and both exchanges have
said they will consider other forms of cooperation if the deal
falls through  although it is unclear in what form 	
    An even less likely scenario is that Singapore salvages the
deal and manages to convince the Australian government of the
merits of a takeover 	
 I don t think Magnus and others in the Singapore camp feel
the need to do something immediately  They can wait and see how
things shake out  globally  and look for something in the future
whether as a target or an acquirer   said a banker  who asked
not to be named

 The S P broke above 1 330 following several unsuccessful
attempts in the past month  If the index stays convincingly
above that threshold  it may trigger more buying 
 The U S  manufacturing sector grew at a marginally slower
pace in March after accelerating at its fastest rate in nearly
seven years the previous month  according to the Institute for
Supply Management  Stocks were little affected by the data 
 Construction spending fell more than expected in February

10324,231839,NDAQ,NYSE to run software tests for trading firms ahead of Alibaba IPO ,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    The New York Stock Exchange said it will hold a test run of Alibaba Group Holding s highly anticipated market debut  reflecting the securities industry s focus on risk controls after a raft of technical snafus in recent years 
NYSE  owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   said in a note to traders on Tuesday it would allow firms to test their trading software ahead of the initial public offering of Alibaba on July 12 for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange 
The Chinese e commerce company s trading debut this summer could be the largest ever technology IPO in the U S   possibly eclipsing Facebook Inc s  O FB   15 billion share sale in May 2012 
Facebook s trading debut on Nasdaq OMX Group s  O NDAQ  exchange was plagued with software problems as massive volumes of orders came in  setting off a chain of events that market making firms said cost them a combined  500 million 
Nasdaq  which was fined  10 million by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission over the problems  said it would voluntarily compensate firms that had been harmed up to a total of  62 million 
NYSE regularly conducts systems testing during the weekends but it was only last October  ahead of Twitter Inc s  N TWTR  market debut  that it opened up for an IPO simulation requested by member firms  many of which participated in Facebook s IPO 

During the Twitter IPO simulation  NYSE was testing mainly for two things  To see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the IPO  and to make sure that once the IPO took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been executed 
The Facebook incident was one of a number of high profile technology related problems that have roiled markets and weighed on investor confidence in recent years  placing a bigger focus on operational risk by regulators and market participants

10326,231841,NDAQ,JPMorgan s profit misses  posts unexpected  1 billion legal expense,news,"By Tanya Agrawal and David Henry   Reuters    JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM  reported lower than estimated third quarter profit on Tuesday as unexpected legal expenses of  1 billion caught analysts off guard and offset strength in its capital markets and lending businesses   The bulk of the costs came from setting aside money to resolve government probes into alleged rigging of foreign exchange rates  Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said   JPMorgan  the biggest U S  bank  also reported higher than expected operating costs  with compensation  technology and marketing all up  Lake cited strong business growth  and added that JPMorgan may breach its annual expense target of  58 billion this year    We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses   she said on a conference call with analysts   JPMorgan and other big banks have been trying to bolster profits through cost cutting for years  as low interest rates and new regulations have crimped revenue growth  But the efforts have been overshadowed by multibillion dollar fines and higher costs for technology and compliance   A year ago  JPMorgan reported its first loss since 2004 due to  7 2 billion in litigation expenses  Overall  the bank agreed to pay nearly  20 billion in 2013 to settle various legal issues  Yet other matters  like the foreign exchange probes  remain unresolved    The ongoing high level of litigation expense after last year s     mega settlement is a bit disturbing   said Chris Kotowski  an analyst with Oppenheimer   Co   At some point  it ceases to become a  special  item    Overall  JPMorgan reported earnings of  5 6 billion  or  1 36 per share  compared with a loss of  380 million a year earlier  Analysts expected earnings of  1 38 per share  on average  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S   Revenue rose 5 percent to  24 2 billion from  23 1 billion in the third quarter of 2013    MODEL OF STABILITY   JPMorgan was hit with a technical glitch on Tuesday as its earnings release appeared hours ahead of schedule due to a  human error  at a vendor that handles its investor relations documents   The earnings report was the first since Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon  58  underwent radiation and chemotherapy for throat cancer  The illness has raised questions about who might succeed him if he steps down   Dimon said his prognosis remained  excellent   allowing him to maintain a busier schedule  but added that he was still monitoring his health with regular doctor visits   Dimon told reporters on a conference call that the bank was seeing  a broad based recovery  in the United States  both in consumer and corporate markets   A recent uptick in volatility helped JPMorgan s trading business  but Dimon said products that deliver more stable earnings in the retail bank were not affected by brief market swings   Revenue from fixed income  currency and commodity trading rose 2 1 percent to  3 51 billion in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier   Total investment banking revenue rose 2 percent to  1 54 billion  driven by higher advisory fees  But net income from mortgage banking fell 38 percent  439 million    The headline numbers have come out slightly below expectations  but the model of stability is there  and that s ultimately what you want from a bank   said Simon Maughan  head of research at financial analysis firm OTAS Technologies in London

10327,231842,NDAQ,Exclusive  U S  stock options markets agree to need for trading halts on big moves,news,"By John McCrank NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  options market operators have agreed in recent months on the need for new automatic trading halts when stock options prices suddenly surge or plunge  in a bid to reduce excess volatility and blunt the impact of erroneous trades  according to five sources with knowledge of their discussions 
The plan  which takes its cue from a rule known as  Limit Up Limit Down  that U S  stock markets put in place in response to the May 6  2010  Flash Crash   is still in the early stages  with market operators trying to figure out how a similar rule could be applied to options trading  the sources said  
In the stock market  if the price of a stock moves outside of a range of prices it has recently traded in for more than 15 seconds  the stock is briefly halted to give traders a chance to figure out if the move was justified  or if it might have been in error 
There are currently 12 options markets in the United States  run by Nasdaq OMX Group  BATS Global Markets  Deutsche Boerse s ISE unit  TMX Group s BOX Options Exchange  Miami International Holdings Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc s NYSE unit 
 This initiative makes great sense for the industry to pursue and we re happy to work with market participants and regulators to make it a reality   said Jeromee Johnson  who runs BATS  options market 
Boris Ilyevsky  managing director of ISE s options exchanges  said that ISE supports the concept of a theoretical price band for options  noting that it would be an added risk protection mechanism for the market  He said the exchange is in discussion with regulators and other exchanges  adding that  much work remains to be done to create a structure that provides sufficient protection but also allows sufficient flexibility in volatile market conditions  
The other market operators declined to comment 
The options market plan is likely years away from being implemented  But the move by market operators highlights growing concerns over the speed and complexity of options markets  which are dominated by computerized trading  after a series of operational snafus in the markets in recent years  These include a software error by Goldman Sachs Group Inc in August 2013 that flooded stock options markets with bad trades  sending some options prices down sharply  
Operational risks are not limited to the options markets and there are worries that because of the interconnectedness of the ultra fast electronic markets  a problem in one market could quickly spiral out of control and affect other asset classes 
The idea of adding Limit Up Limit Down to the options market has merit  said Michael Schwartz  chief options strategist at Oppenheimer   Co Inc 
 It would let them be able to stop and say   Did you mean to do that    he said   It gives them a chance to make certain these are not erroneous and could affect other options that are trading    
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority declined to comment 
 
LONG PROCESS
Market structure changes can take time to implement  as different operators must come to agreement  figure out the technical details and have regulators sign off on the plans  The Limit Up Limit Down rule in stock markets  for example  was proposed by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2011  It was approved in June 2012  but not fully implemented at the exchanges until May 2014 
The task is much more complicated in options markets  which means the equities rule cannot be simply pasted into the options rule book  the sources said    
The issues include the question of whether to base the price band on the option itself  or on the underlying stock  Further  there are around 5 000 companies publicly listed on U S  stock exchanges to which the price bands apply  But there are more than half a million options series based on those stocks  and many of them rarely trade 
Cognizant of these difficulties  options market operators have decided to take a two step approach to bringing order to their markets  which currently operate under a disparate set of rules    
Sources previously told Reuters that the first part of the plan  which creates a uniform set of rules on how to deal with erroneous trades  is soon to be filed with regulators  

Options market operators would like to apply the price bands to options as the second phase of the plan  the sources said

10330,231845,NDAQ,Major exchanges seek to dismiss high frequency trading lawsuit,news,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK  Reuters    Major U S  stock exchanges have asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing them of costing ordinary investors billions of dollars by rigging markets to benefit high frequency traders 
Exchanges including Nasdaq  O NDAQ   Intercontinental Exchange Inc s  N ICE  New York Stock Exchange  Bats Global Markets and CHX Holdings Inc s Chicago Stock Exchange said they deserve  absolute immunity  because they regulate themselves  and that only the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission could review the plaintiffs  claims 
A co defendant  Barclays Plc  L BARC   said the plaintiffs failed to show it intended to fraudulently conceal the use by high frequency traders of its Barclays LX platform  sometimes called a  dark pool   or that this use caused trading losses 
Andrew Brown  a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman   Dowd representing plaintiffs led by the city of Providence  Rhode Island and four pension funds  did not immediately respond on Tuesday to request for comment 
The dismissal requests were filed late Monday in the U S  District Court in Manhattan 
They came amid increased scrutiny for high frequency trading firms  which use computer algorithms to gain split second trading advantages 
On Oct  16  the SEC brought its first market manipulation case against such a firm  fining New York based Athena Capital Research  1 million for using the algorithm  Gravy  to send a blizzard of trades just before the market close 
Athena did not admit wrongdoing  Michael Lewis  in his best seller  Flash Boys  A Wall Street Revolt  published in March  accused high frequency trading firms of rigging markets  The firms account for more than half of U S  stock market trades 
In the Manhattan lawsuit  exchange operators and Barclays were accused of giving high frequency traders special access to exchange floors and enhanced data feeds  and letting them install computer servers near the exchanges  own 
The plaintiffs said this created an  uneven playing field  that has since April 2009 diverted billions of dollars a year from ordinary investors and led to  billions more  in kickbacks  They seek class action status and unspecified damages 
In urging dismissal of the case  the exchange operators said the SEC had  expressly authorized  their dealings with high frequency trading firms  even if it meant faster trading speeds 
They also called disseminating market data a  core regulatory function  of exchanges that could not be challenged in court 
Barclays  meanwhile  said the plaintiffs based their claims on confidential marketing materials they never saw or relied on 
The British bank also accused the plaintiffs of  parroting unproven assertions  made by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in June when he sued Barclays over its dark pool  Barclays has sought to dismiss that lawsuit 
The pension fund plaintiffs are located in Alexandria  Virginia  Boston  the Virgin Islands and Stockholm

10331,231846,NDAQ,Nasdaq wins bid to manage key data processor for stock trading,news,"By Herbert Lash NEW YORK  Reuters    Nasdaq OMX Group Inc  O NDAQ  on Wednesday won a contract to manage a stock market data processor that sparked a three hour trading halt in 2013 and recently was at the center of a stand off among exchanges over who they would select as the winner 
Representatives from 14 U S  stock exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority selected Nasdaq after a months long bidding process  according to a statement from Jordan   Jordan  a Wall Street consultancy that managed the bid 
Nasdaq agreed to a service contract that will require the SIP to be available 99 98 percent of the time  Jordan   Jordan said  The exchange operator had managed the  securities information processor   SIP  for years without a hitch until a malfunction sparked the trading halt in August 2013 
The selection of Nasdaq will lead to the formation of a limited liability company that an exchange source said would be called CTC LLC  short for Consolidated Tape C 
Tape C is jargon for the Nasdaq listed stocks whose price and quotation information used to be published on a tape  Last sale prices and quotations from all the U S  stock exchanges are consolidated by the SIP and then disseminated to the market 
Nasdaq last year said it no longer wanted to manage the SIP and demanded changes to the contract for running the processor  including the creation of a limited liability company  Nasdaq in September won a contract to administer the SIP s billing 
After the SIP malfunctioned  the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered all the exchange operators to bolster the processors  resiliency and to implement back up systems 
Nasdaq also agreed to swap the system of the current SIP it manages to INET technology  a move that will reduce the time it takes to transmit stock prices and quotations to 50 microseconds in early 2016  Jordan   Jordan said 
Within a year after INET technology is in place  the delivery time will be cut to 25 microseconds  According to data published by a unit of the New York Stock Exchange  trades in Nasdaq stocks were executed on average in 720 microseconds in the second quarter 
Nasdaq won the vote after 11 firms submitted documents showing their intent to bid and four of the firms were short listed as finalists  Jordan   Jordan said 
The four finalists were Nasdaq  Thesys Technologies LLC  CenturyLink and a unit of exchange operator Miami International Holdings Inc  Several votes deadlocked over Nasdaq and Thesys  a unit of proprietary trading firm Tradeworx  sources close to the bidding process told Reuters 

A breakdown of the voting was not detailed  but an exchange source said the vote was unanimous

One of the issues that the regulator is looking at is the  maker taker  model of fee based incentives used by many exchanges to attract traders  In that system  brokerages earn rebates by sending in resting orders to bring more liquidity  and must pay fees if they take away liquidity through orders that can be executed immediately 
But critics argue that maker taker pricing distorts stock order routing practices 
 Maker taker is one of the issues we ve heard a lot about   White said at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association s annual meeting   It s clearly an important priority as we re going through this review  but again  we want to be data driven and be right about whatever adjustments that we make  
She also said that the SEC plans to finalize  possibly by year end  a new rule known as Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity  which focuses on strengthening exchanges and certain  dark pool  trading venues against technology failures and cyber attacks 
That rule was proposed following a raft of high profile technology snafus in recent years  including the botched initial public offering of Facebook Inc  O FB  by exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group  O NDAQ  and the near collapse of Knight Capital  now part of KCG Holdings  N KCG   after it suffered a  461 million trading error 

 You never get to a point where you sort of declare  mission accomplished    White said   The markets have evolved and continue to evolve and technology is continuing to evolve  and so it is a process to enhance the resiliency and robustness of the market

10335,231850,NDAQ,ANALYSIS Gulf Arab bourses chase global alliances  shun MA,news,"  Gulf Arab bourses interested in global link ups
   Global exchanges take positions for eventual consolidation
   Dubai leads in terms of volumes  diversification
   Dubai s two bourses expected to merge
 
 By Matt Smith
 DUBAI  Aug 10  Reuters    Political pride is likely to delay
much needed consolidation of Gulf Arab stock exchanges  with
regional bourses focusing instead on alliances with global
players and diversification from cash equities 
 Bahrain will launch the ninth stock exchange in the region
next year    the United Arab Emirates alone has three bourses   
and with volumes low and fees high  the case for consolidation
is strong 
 But there is little enthusiasm among bourse officials for a
pan Gulf exchange  despite the fragmentation of liquidity being
a major deterrent for foreign investors  and Dubai is likely to
remain pre eminent for some time to come 
  A lot of this is political  if the exchanges were purely
profit driven then consolidation would happen a lot sooner  
said Robert McKinnon  Al Mal Capital managing director  
 The UAE apart  regional bourses have little domestic
competition to worry about  with rival exchanges unlikely to
receive regulatory approval to trade  as has happened in
developed markets  This protectionism enables Gulf bourses to
charge fees many times higher than their global counterparts 
  The global economy has slowed the development of the
regional stock markets  The question is whether an economy the
size of the UAE s can support three stock markets competing for
the same liquidity   the answer is no and I think they know
that   said a Dubai based analyst 
 But Gulf bourses are increasingly eager to link up with
international players and move away from cash equities  
 In June  the Qatar Exchange agreed to sell a 20 percent
stake to NYSE Euronext and said it would launch a derivatives
platform  exchange traded funds and bonds  
 Analysts said the Qatar deal showed the accent was on
rivalry and not consolidation  though competition could
eventually lead to more pressure to merge 
  It shows the race is on for who wants to become the
regional hub   said Haissam Arabi  chief executive of Gulfmena
Alternative Investments   This is in everybody s best interests 
with more competition pushing innovation  the creation of new
instruments and better pricing  
 McKinnon said if markets opened up to competition  fees
would have to come down eventually and if this happened there
would be a need to consolidate 
 
 ALLY  DIVERSIFY
 The alliances are driven by the needs of both the
international players and the Gulf bourses 
  International exchanges are making a land grab and placing
their bets in terms of who will be stronger going forward   said
Al Mal s McKinnon   They are buying an option on the future
success of the exchanges and buying a seat at any potential
consolidation in the future   
The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and Kuwait Stock Exchange
have agreements with NYSE and Nasdaq OMX respectively and plan
to launch derivatives markets 
  Derivatives will enhance liquidity substantially and are
part of the maturing of the regional markets   said Rami Sidani 
Schroders Middle East head of investment  
 Nasdaq Dubai is the regional leader of diversification  with
an exchange traded commodity  listed bonds and a derivatives
exchange  The latter trades futures on 20 UAE stocks and an
index future 
 Yet few of Nasdaq Dubai s 15 equities trade on a daily
basis  while trade is buoyant on its sister exchange  the Dubai
Financial Market  which is owned by Government owned Borse
Dubai  The latter sold a one third stake in the rebranded Nasdaq
Dubai exchange to Nasdaq OMX Group in 2008  
 There are signs that international players could have a role
in pushing much needed consolidation 
 Analysts anticipate a merger of Borse Dubai s two exchanges
after the proposed consolidation of back office operations which
will bring DFM and Nasdaq Dubai on to a single trading system 
  There are areas where we re working very closely together
where we could both benefit   Essa Kazim  Borse Dubai chairman
and executive chairman of the DFM  told Reuters in June 
 He said cross listings between the two Dubai exchanges
 could be a logical solution   but would not comment when asked
whether the DFM and Nasdaq Dubai would merge 
 Gulfmena s Arabi said regulatory constraints would hamper
the various exchanges  international ambitions 
  We re nowhere near Singapore where you can set up a company
and manage Indian equities    these are the sort of restrictions
that need to be lifted if the Qatar move is going to be anything
more than a real estate deal   he said 
 Daily trading on the DFM s General Index averaged 565
million shares in the past three months  dwarfing Qatar s 16 8
million 
  Dubai will continue to be ahead of the curve and Qatar is
playing catch up  but there s enough wealth in the region to
allow for more than one player   added Schroders  Sidani

10337,231852,NDAQ,UPDATE 5 Plunge in 10 US ETFs triggers  flash crash  memories,news,"  Prices on 10 new ETFs crash briefly after market open
   NYSE says limit orders were placed as market orders
   Nasdaq cancels related trades
  Adds comment  background 
 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK  March 31  Reuters    Ten new exchange traded
funds suffered their own mini  flash crashes  shortly after the
U S  stock market opened on Thursday  suggesting recent
measures put in place to protect against extreme market moves
may not be enough 
 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc  said it canceled trades in 10
new ETFs sponsored by Scottrade affiliate FocusShares  some of
which briefly plummeted as much as 98 percent 
 The latest abrupt share drop comes on the heels of several
sudden and unexplained plunges that remind investors of the May
2010 flash crash  which wiped out nearly  1 trillion in market
capitalization in a few minutes and have kept retail investors
wary of trading stocks 
  I would be surprised if this  a flash crash  doesn t
happen again in the future  unless they really address these
issues   said James Dailey  portfolio manager of TEAM Asset
Strategy Fund in Harrisburg  Pennsylvania 
 After the crash  exchanges adopted so called circuit
breakers that halt trading in hundreds of stocks and ETFs when
their price moves 10 percent or more during a rolling
five minute period 
 The ETFs that plunged on Thursday were not covered by these
breakers 
  The sharp drops in these ETFs argue for extending the
individual circuit breakers to more exchange traded securities 
as the SEC reportedly is considering   said Robert Colby  a
partner at Davis Polk and former deputy director in the SEC s
trading and markets division 
 The New York Stock Exchange later said the errors occurred
after market orders were entered that were intended to be limit
orders  Under a market order a stock is immediately bought or
sold at the best available price  while a limit order is meant
to protect an investment by selling a share at a specific 
requested price 
 A FocusShares spokeswoman said a mispricing by a market
maker triggered the faulty trades 
 Exchange traded funds own baskets of stocks  or other
securities or commodities  and resemble mutual funds except
that they are priced and traded in real time on exchanges  In
theory  the funds are supposed to track closely the value of an
underlying index 
 In February  a special committee recommended that the U S 
Securities and Exchange Commission expand the circuit breakers
to cover  all but the most inactively traded listed equity
securities  ETFs  and options and single stock futures on
thoses securities    ID nN18265444  
 The plunge in the ETFs follows similar occurrences in other
shares  Apple Inc  shares dropped by more than 2 0
percent in just minutes before recovering in February  Last
July  trading in Cisco Systems Inc  shares was briefly
halted after the stock fell more than 10 percent 
 The new FocusShares ETFs started trading on Wednesday and
are trying to compete with more established funds by offering
lower costs for broad market ETFs  Like many new ETFs  the
FocusShares were illiquid and more prone to market
fluctuations 
 Nasdaq OMX canceled trades in all of the ETFs that were
more than 10 percent lower in price than where they trading
previously  calling them  clearly erroneous  
 The Focus Morningstar Healthcare ETF  fell as low as
60 cents after trading as high as  25 33  while the Focus Real
Estate ETF  dropped to  1 48 from  25 50 
 The canceled trades took place between 9 54 a m   1354 GMT 
and 9 56 a m   1356 GMT   according to Nasdaq 
 The FocusShares Focus Morningstar US Market Index ETF
carries an expense ratio of 0 05 percent  less than
broad market ETFs from Schwab and Vanguard  The sector specific
ETFs have expense ratios of 0 19 percent 
 Schwab s US Broad Market ETF has a 0 06 percent expense
ratio  The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF carries an expense
ratio of 0 07 percent  according to Vanguard

10340,231855,NDAQ,INTERVIEW Borse Dubai has no plans to sell LSE stake,news,"  Chairman does not rule out raising stake in UK bourse
   Borse Dubai largest shareholder with 21 percent
   Believes stock exchanges will return to  right value 
 
 By Matt Smith
 DUBAI  June 15  Reuters    Borse Dubai has no plans to sell
its stake in the London Stock Exchange Group and does not rule
out increasing it  its chairman told Reuters in an interview 
 Borse Dubai  which is wholly owned by the government of
Dubai  holds a 21 percent stake in the LSE Group  making it the
largest single shareholder  having acquired its holding as part
of a complex three way deal with Nasdaq and Europe s OMX group 
  It s a strategic investment and we will keep it as long as
we feel we need to keep it   Essa Kazim said on Sunday  adding
there were no current plans to sell 
 Asked if Borse Dubai was considering raising its stake in
the LSE  Kazim said   All options are on the table  
 The Nasdaq OMX Borse Dubai deal was completed in February 
2008  with Borse Dubai taking a 19 99 percent share of the newly
created Nasdaq OMX Group and receiving Nasdaq s 28 percent stake
in the LSE  
 The latter was diluted following LSE s subsequent merger
with Borsa Italiana  while Nasdaq OMX has a 33 percent share of
the rebranded Nasdaq Dubai  with Borse Dubai owning the
remainder  
 The deal cost Borse Dubai  which also owns 80 percent of the
Dubai Financial Market   4 9 billion and was finalised before
the financial crisis struck  but Kazim denied he overpaid 
 LSE shares closed at 739 5 pence on Friday  making Borse
Dubai s LSE stake worth 416 5 million pounds   687 4 million  
  We truly believe stock exchanges will be back again to the
right value  if you look across the financial sectors  the least
impacted were the stock exchanges   said Kazim 
  The LSE stock price has doubled in a very short time 
Longer term  exchanges will be in a much stronger position to
recover their value than any other entities  
 But analysts have said the outlook for Britain s largest
stockmarket  which swung to a 250 million pound loss last year 
remains very challenging  As well as being hit by deteriorating
economic conditions  the exchange is also locked in a fierce
battle for business with new low cost entrants such as Chi X and
Turquoise 
 In February  Borse Dubai signed a  2 5 billion medium term
loan facility to help refinance a  3 8 billion loan used to fund
the Nasdaq OMX deal  with the state owned Investment Corporation
of Dubai  ICD  also providing a  1 billion equity injection 
This allayed fears that Borse Dubai would struggle to refinance
its debts  amid a sharp slowdown in Dubai s economy 
 The Qatar Investment Authority  a Qatar sovereign wealth
fund  also has a 15 percent stake in the LSE  but Kazim said
Dubai had no dialogue with Qatar over their respective holdings 
 We never to talk to them  Qatar  about our strategy as far as
our stake in London is concerned   added Kazim

10354,231869,NDAQ,EU watchdog expands oversight of energy market trading,news,"By Nerijus Adomaitis and Nina Chestney
OSLO LONDON  Reuters    The European Union started on Thursday to amass information about all so called over the counter trades in the region s energy markets in a bid to crack down on suspected price manipulation 
EU watchdog the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators  ACER  began collecting data about trades on official energy exchanges within Europe in October but says it can only get a full picture once informal transactions are tracked too 
Over the counter  OTC  trades account for at least two thirds of Europe s multi billion dollar wholesale power and gas trading markets  The EU has been concerned energy prices could be rigged with inside information  or with tactics used in stock markets such as  layering  where traders bombard systems with orders they do not intend to execute to try to shift prices 
As a result  the EU launched the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Integrity and Transparency  REMIT  in December 2011  and the watchdog hopes the collection of OTC data will improve the integrity and transparency of the markets 
There are several hundred companies involved in wholesale electricity and gas trading in Europe with up to 10 000 transactions a day  all of which makes it difficult to nail down whether there has been market manipulation 
ACER said the REMIT market monitoring framework was unprecedented  not only for the energy sector and its geographic scope  but also for its complexity 
Since it started tracking exchange transactions on Oct  7  the EU watchdog had received data on more than 79 million orders and 23 million of trades on the EU s power and gas exchanges by Feb  15  according to a presentation by the agency 
The agency declined to say how many alerts had been triggered by its surveillance software so far  or potential market breaches detected  citing confidentiality 
According to ACER s annual report published last September  out of 58 potential breaches in 2013 and 2014  26 were related to suspected market manipulation 
ACER said it proved market manipulation in two out of the 14 cases it closed in 2014  though neither was sanctioned  Estonia and Spain sanctioned two REMIT breach cases in 2015  Both companies in question have appealed 
NO MAGIC BULLET
The EU watchdog uses market surveillance software SMARTS to monitor trading for suspicious behavior  SMARTS  developed in Australia  was acquired by the U S  Nasdaq Inc   O NDAQ  and is also used to monitor trading in Nordic power derivatives 
ACER said the surveillance software has been adapted and customized to fit the monitoring of EU wholesale energy markets  though some industry sources were skeptical about whether it would actually spot price manipulation 
 The agency is confident that the software enables an efficient monitoring of EU energy markets   ACER told Reuters in an emailed statement 
Still  some industry sources say the software used by the watchdog will have trouble pinpointing transgressions  partly because many of the traded power contracts overlap 
For example  the price of a quarterly power contract could be moved by trading in monthly contracts  and those can be broken up into weekly contracts  making it more difficult to trace manipulation through trades 
 ACER will drown in false alarms   one source familiar with the system said   It will be up to market whistleblowers to bring cases to the prosecution  
Nasdaq s energy trading arm  Nasdaq Commodities  said most investigations into suspected energy market manipulation in 2015 were based on tips from market participants  including one reported to the Norwegian authorities  
Another industry source said while the SMARTS system would need small adjustments over time to work efficiently with EU energy markets it had already proven successful in equity markets  and would get there in the end 
Last year  the software was used to help prove a case in the British High Court of share price manipulation through  layering   Australian media reported  resulting in a 7 6 million pound   10 7 million  fine 
 It s not a magic bullet  but the system will be able to lift the fingerprints after some tuning   Tony Sio  head of SMARTS Market Surveillance at Nasdaq  told Reuters  speaking about the software being used by ACER

performance this year has lagged that of other major exchange operators  Shares of Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  are up about 17 percent  Intercontinental Exchange Inc s  N ICE  is up about 10 percent and CME Group Inc  O CME  shares have risen 18 percent  Concerns the index was being manipulated surfaced last year after John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas  Austin wrote an academic paper that noted significant spikes in trading volume in S P 500 index options right at the time of settlement  The paper also compared the value of the VIX at settlement with its value as calculated from S P 500 options right after the settlement  and showed the two tend to diverge  Instances of big deviations are taken as evidence by some that unscrupulous traders have been deliberately moving the settlement price  A stock market fall on Feb  5 that caused the VIX to surge the most in its 25 year history brought further scrutiny to the index  and led to dozens of lawsuits and ongoing probes into the matter by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission   The regulators have yet to comment on the matter and Cboe has denied the manipulation accusations  citing liquidity problems and legitimate hedging activity as reasons for unusual moves on settlement days   Only a forensic analysis of those episodes can confirm or refute such a claim   said Kambiz Kazemi  partner at Canadian investment management firm La Financi re Constance   Meanwhile  the steps Cboe has taken to address the claims of manipulation are going in the right direction  said Kazemi  The exchange operator recently overhauled the technology behind the auctions  improved the speed with which it sends alerts about auction imbalances  and sought to increase the number of market makers that provide buy and sell quotes for the auction   POLICING THE FEAR GAUGE Orderly VIX settlement auctions over the last few months have helped take some of the pressure off the Chicago based exchange operator   I think we all will be observing the effects of the Cboe measures in the next few months   Kazemi said  VIX and associated products accounted for roughly a quarter of Cboe s 2017 earnings  analysts estimate  and the controversy around the product has spooked some stockholders  While financial firms have been using artificial intelligence software for everything from compliance to stock picking  a growing number of firms have started to use it for market oversight  Given the huge amount of data involved in market surveillance  machine learning algorithms can be far more efficient than humans in rooting out potential market manipulation  said Richard Johnson  a market structure and technology consultant at Greenwich Associates   It s going to be a must have   he said  FINRA  which already monitors Cboe s market on the company s behalf  confirmed it was working on machine learning to enhance surveillance of the VIX settlement auctions  but would not offer specifics  More generally  the Wall Street watchdog is working to use artificial intelligence to catch nefarious activities more quickly  including schemes that may have previously been unknown to regulators  said Tom Gira  who oversees FINRA s market regulation department  
He said FINRA has begun using machine learning to scan for illegal activities across stock and options exchanges and is in the process of adding a feedback loop to the software that would regularly incorporate analysts  data and allow the machines to detect ever changing manipulation patterns ",2018-09-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/cboe-exchange-turns-to-machines-to-police-its-fear-gauge-1616991,1616991

10458,231973,NDAQ,New group tries to boost the EU s capital markets as Brexit looms,news,"By Huw Jones
LONDON  Reuters    The European Union could speed up efforts to build an EU wide capital market by creating euro denominated benchmarks for trading commodities  a new group backed by financial companies  former politicians and central bankers said on Friday 
The EU launched its capital markets union  CMU  project in 2014 to encourage more companies to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds to cut the region s reliance on bank loans 
In the EU  companies are still heavy users of banks to get cash unlike in the United States where firms routinely tap the country s vast capital market to raise money by selling bonds or shares 
Progress toward an EU capital market has been slow but Brexit has created a sense of urgency because London  the region s biggest capital market  is due to leave the EU next month 
The group   Markets4Europe   will launch its blueprint to help to deepen the EU capital markets in Brussels on Wednesday  a month before a new European Commission comes into office 
Many of its recommendations try to tackle familiar unresolved issues  but Markets4Europe wants to talk directly to member states  whose support is needed to make progress  rather than call for another  top down  reboot from Brussels 
There are also new ideas  such as strengthening the international role of the euro by developing euro benchmarks for commodity markets 
London dominates many of the major commodity benchmarks such as crude oil and gold as well as industrial metals like copper 
Markets4Europe suggests creating benchmarks for liquid gas  hydrogen and emissions trading to attract liquidity to those markets and boost the EU s role in global financial markets 
Another new idea is to create a so called  safe asset  in the euro zone 
European Central Bank officials have suggested this could be composed of a pool of sovereign bonds to cut the heavy exposure of banks in the euro zone to their own national debt and help to knit cross border markets by acting as collateral to back trades 
After Brexit  Brussels is keen to reduce Europe s reliance on London based financial services through a trade off between the level of financial market access granted to the UK and extent of EU capital market  autonomy  
Markets4Europe also wants more efficient cross border clearing of securities within the EU  London currently dominates euro denominated clearing in interest rate swaps 
The group is backed by Vitor Constancio  former vice president of the European Central Bank  Christian Noyer  former Bank of France governor  Viviane Reding  former vice president of the European Commission  and Germany s former finance minister Peer Steinbrueck 
Allianz Global Investors  DE ALVG    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  Euroclear   Euronext   PA ENX   BlackRock  NYSE BLK   SocGen  PA SOGN   Deutsche Boerse  DE DB1Gn   Nasdaq Stockholm  O NDAQ  and UniCredit  MI CRDI  are among the firms that contributed to the recommendations 
Viviane Reding  for example  will focus on national justice ministries to win backing for streamlining taxation and insolvency rules  two sensitive areas where progress has been slow so far  but essential for integrating the legal underpinnings of cross border markets ",2019-09-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/new-group-tries-to-boost-the-eus-capital-markets-as-brexit-looms-1987779,1987779
10459,231974,NDAQ,Exclusive  Nasdaq cracks down on IPOs of small Chinese companies,news,"By Echo Wang and Joshua Franklin  Reuters    Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  is cracking down on initial public offerings  IPOs  of small Chinese companies by tightening restrictions and slowing down their approval  according to regulatory filings  corporate executives and investment bankers  Nasdaq s attempt to limit these stock market flotations comes as a growing number of them end up raising most of the capital in their IPO from Chinese sources  rather than from U S  investors   The shares of most small Chinese companies trade thinly following their U S  listing  because most of them stay in the hands of a few insiders  Their low liquidity makes them unattractive to many large institutional investors  to whom Nasdaq is seeking to cater  For example  when  111 Inc   O YI   a Chinese online pharmacy network  raised  100 million in its IPO on Nasdaq last year  shares were mainly sold to connections of the company s executives  111 CEO Liu Junling told Reuters in an interview  Digital influencer incubator  Ruhnn Holding Ltd   O RUHN   after school education provider  Puxin  Ltd  N NEW   and pet product manufacturer Dogness International Corp  O DOGZ  are other examples of Chinese companies that listed on Nasdaq in the last two years with more investors from China snapping up their shares than from the United states  according to sources close to the companies  Ruhnn  Puxin  and Dogness did not respond to requests for comment   One critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies  The statutory obligation of all U S  equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for U S  investors   a Nasdaq spokeswoman said   The Nasdaq spokeswoman declined to comment specifically on the impact of the changes in the listing rules on the U S  IPOs of small Chinese companies   At a time of escalating tensions between the United States and China over trade and technology  Nasdaq s curbs on small Chinese IPOs represent the latest flashpoint in the financial relationship between the world s two largest economies  U S  listed shares of Chinese companies fell sharply on Friday following reports that the White House was considering delisting Chinese companies from U S  stock exchanges  A U S  Treasury official said on Saturday that U S  President Donald Trump s administration was not considering blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U S  stock exchanges  at this time   A source close to Nasdaq said the changes to its listing rules were not the result of discussions with the White House  A White House spokesman declined to comment on Nasdaq s listing rule changes  In June  U S  lawmakers introduced a bill  which has yet to be adopted  that would force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight  including providing access to audits  or face delisting   Nasdaq first proposed changing the listing rules in October 2018  and the changes took effect last month   Nasdaq s concern about low liquidity and high volatility in the marketplace brought about by such Chinese IPOs has become very obvious since mid 2018   said Ralph De Martino  chair of U S  law firm Schiff Hardin LLP s Asia practice  which advises Chinese companies on their IPOs   STRICTER RULES Nasdaq s new listing rules have raised the average trading volume requirements for a stock  and call for at least 50  of a company s shareholders to invest a minimum of  2 500 each in an IPO  Nasdaq also said in June that it may delay the U S  listing of a company that does not demonstrate a strong enough nexus to the U S  capital markets  including having no shareholders  operations  management or board members with links to the United States  Small Chinese firms pursue these IPOs because they allow their founders and backers to cash out  rewarding them with U S  dollars they cannot easily access because of China s capital controls  The companies also use their Nasdaq listed status to convince lenders in China to fund them and often get subsidies from Chinese local authorities for becoming publicly traded  Unlike Nasdaq  the Chinese stock market has strict listing criteria that prevent some loss making companies from going public  The geographically adjacent Hong Kong stock exchange is also viewed by IPO hopefuls as more strict compared to Nasdaq   Chinese companies have raised over 70 billion in the U S  stock market since 2000  according to Refinitiv data  While the biggest ones  such as e commerce giants  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA   Pingduoduo Inc  O PDD  and JD com Inc  O JD   have attracted major U S  stock market investors  many small ones have proved unpopular  This is largely due to their poor track record  Shares of Chinese IPOs that raised  200 million or less have traded down 38  on average since their IPO through July 31 in the last 18 months  compared to a rise of 13 9  for U S  companies of the same size  according to Dealogic data  Some 19 Chinese companies went public on the Nasdaq in 2018  up from 8 in 2017  based on submissions by investment banks underwriting them to Dealogic  IPOS HELD UP Following the listing rule changes  small Chinese IPOs have experienced longer waiting times and scrutiny from Nasdaq before they are allowed to proceed with their IPOs  according to corporate and investment banking sources   For example  Xuezhu Wang  CEO of Happiness Biotech Group Ltd  O HAPP   a Chinese company that manufactures and sells nutraceuticals  told Reuters he promised Nasdaq to secure at least 30  of the IPO proceeds from U S  investors  in order to be allowed to list  As most of the small Chinese companies pursuing U S  IPOs have no U S  business presence or brand recognition  hiring U S  citizens as board members is now being adopted as a tactic to get listings approved  Chinese executives and investment bankers say  China Xiangtai Food Co  O PLIN   a pork processing company based in Chongqing City in southwest China  had to add two U S  citizens to its board of directors to be allowed by Nasdaq to complete its IPO in August 2019  according to two people familiar with the matter  Xiangtai did not respond to a request for comments   The New York Stock Exchange  the other major U S  stock exchange  operated by Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   is looking closely at Chinese listings  according to a source familiar with the matter  However  it has yet to introduce rule changes similar to Nasdaq   
 The New York Stock Exchange has a longstanding commitment to good governance  rigorously adhering to both the letter and spirit of our listing standards   a New York Stock Exchange spokesman said ",2019-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-nasdaq-cracks-down-on-ipos-of-small-chinese-companies-1988566,1988566
10460,231975,NDAQ,Chinese companies rethink U S  IPOs after Trump s delisting threat,news,"By Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI  Reuters    Bestbond  a Chinese apartment rental company  had been planning on a Nasdaq flotation in one to two years but as U S  China trade tensions racheted higher  the Hong Kong stock exchange emerged as a possible candidate  Now  it s firmly on the table 
 We re having second thoughts   CFO Wang Jia told Reuters  adding that Hong Kong  despite being beset with political unrest  had become more attractive after news emerged on Friday that U S  President Donald Trump s administration was looking at delisting Chinese companies from U S  bourses 
Bestbond  based in Nanjing  eastern China  still prefers Nasdaq as it is a higher profile  more liquid market that would likely offer better valuations  but the company cannot afford to have its eggs in just one basket  Wang said 
While a U S  Treasury official has said Trump s administration was not considering blocking Chinese companies from U S  listings  at this time   the possibility it may do so has resulted in much handwringing by mainland firms that had been looking at a U S  IPO 
 Too many calls  Every client is worried   said Terence Lin  CEO of World Financial Holding Group  a boutique investment bank which helps Chinese companies with Nasdaq listings 
Two sources said the U S  move was part of a broader idea to limit U S  investment in Chinese firms  while one source has said that it is motivated by security concerns 
Lin believes  however  that Trump s threat would be extremely difficult to implement legally and is merely a negotiation tactic in the rapidly escalating trade war between the world s two biggest economies 
Even if difficult to execute  Trump s threats are bound to hurt Chinese firms already listed in the United States as well as providing bourses such as the Hong Kong and London stock exchanges with a fresh and lucrative opportunity to woo Chinese firms  industry participants said 
 The political uncertainty could exert pressure on the valuations and the liquidity of U S  listed Chinese stocks for a long long time   said Frederick Shen  partner at Chinese venture capital firm New Vision Capital 
Shen said he s increasingly taking his portfolio tech startups to list on China s newly launched STAR Market instead of the Nasdaq

CORNERSTONE WOES
For some firms  Trump s threats have even greater implications 
Cornerstone  a Chinese boutique private equity fund manager  had been hoping for an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in October but now sees an imminent U S  listing as challenging  according to people familiar with management s thinking 
The Guangzhou  southern China based asset manager focuses on investing in Chinese firms that have listed or are seeking to list in the United States  making its business model particularly vulnerable to slumps in those valuations 
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index  HXC   a gauge that tracks Nasdaq listed Chinese firms  slumped more than 4  on Friday 
The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue 
Marcum Bernstein   Pinchuk  a firm that advises Chinese companies on their capital markets strategies  said making equity capital raising a new flashpoint in the war between China and the United States benefits nobody 
 Having just returned from a week in China and given the work we do with pre IPO Chinese companies  it s clear there is a mutual interest among the business community to continue to conduct business   said Drew Bernstein  co managing partner 
He said China had produced more than 180 of the 300 unicorns worldwide and had generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for U S  bankers and advisors

10461,231976,NDAQ,U S  SEC proposes exchanges seek public consultation on data fee changes,news,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  securities regulator on Tuesday proposed a change to the way exchange operators alter their fees  in a move aimed at improving transparency but which could make it harder for operators to compete on price to propel revenue growth 
The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  proposed that operators submit requests to change fees for such services as market data and connectivity with other exchanges  and then seek industry feedback before any changes can be implemented 
At present  operators   such as New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc  N ICE   Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  and Cboe Global Markets Inc  Z CBOE    notify the regulator of fee changes  which then take immediate effect  The system effectively allows operators to compete on price in real time 
In May  the SEC said securities exchange operators must do a better job of describing and justifying their fees when they make a filing  or else the filing will be suspended for review 
Tuesday s proposal  which is subject to public consultation before adoption  comes after a years long dispute over what many brokers and investors see as soaring costs for services essential for trading  but which are also major revenue drivers for most exchange operators 
Exchanges lodge hundreds of fee related filings with the SEC each year  Under current rules   known as the National Market System plan  or Regulation NMS   fee changes become effective immediately to ensure retail investors get the best price possible  NMS also prevents trades being executed at prices inferior to bid and offer prices displayed at other trading venues 
Under Tuesday s proposal  the delay before implementing changes could make it tougher for exchange operators to compete quickly on price  potentially limiting future revenue growth 
 The fees charged by NMS plans affect a wide variety of investors and market participants   SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement   This rulemaking will help ensure that NMS plan fee changes benefit from review and comment by investors and market participants before those fees can be charged  ",2019-10-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-sec-proposes-exchanges-seek-public-consultation-on-data-fee-changes-1990558,1990558

the revenue they were giving up  But the brokers have other ways of profiting from retail trading  including interest earned on customer cash balances and margin lending   There is also payment for order flow  in which wholesale market makers  like Citadel Securities or Virtu Financial pay for the first crack at executing a stock order  They then execute the transaction  either internally  in other off exchange trading venues  or on an exchange  The practice has drawn scrutiny from regulators globally because it creates an incentive for brokers to send orders to whoever pays the most  rather than the place that might get the best outcome for customers  Still  the practice is common among retail brokerages where  mom and pop  investors place their orders  making up around 20 percent of all U S  trading activity  Very few of their stock orders ever go directly to an exchange like Intercontinental Exchange Inc s New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Inc   Canada has banned the practice  The United Kingdom recently put it under review and said in September that nearly all UK based brokerages acting in an agency capacity had stopped accepting payment for order flow   For their part  market makers say they give  on average  a better price than the market is offering  usually a fraction of a penny per share  Retail brokers say they use the additional revenue to improve technology and lower customer costs  When market makers execute orders  they collect the spread between the bid and the offer  which they divide between payment for order flow for the broker  price improvement for the retail trader  and profit  said Richard Repetto  an analyst at Sandler O Neill   Partners  Professional traders covet retail orders because unlike large institutional investors with large portfolios and orders that are big enough to move the market  retail investors tend to be less informed as to which way a stock is likely to be moving and their orders are generally smaller  In trading circles  this is known as  dumb money   Prior to launching its free trading service  IBKR Lite  last Monday  Interactive Brokers did not accept payment for order flow  Users of the company s IBKR Pro service will still pay to trade and their orders will routed to the market where they will get the best execution  instead of being sold   Thomas Peterffy  chairman of Greenwich  Connecticut based Interactive Brokers  said he thought the conflict in payment for order flow is not so much between broker and customers as between the market makers who buy the order flow and the prices at which they execute the orders   The better the execution price the less money the market maker earns   he said in an email   But this has been the story forever on Wall Street  This is how the large investment banks make about  250 billion per year  They call it  trading profits    Online brokers have U S  Securities and Exchange Commission mandated  best execution committees  to ensure that all of their trades are executed inside the national best bid and offer and that the market makers that provide the most price improvement get majority of the order flow  he added  Schwab and TD Ameritrade also said in statements that getting customers the best execution possible is a top priority  Virtu and Citadel Securities declined to comment  For its part  the SEC adopted rules last November that will force brokers to disclose more about any payment for order flow or profit sharing relationships in quarterly public disclosures  But the SEC delayed the compliance date twice after brokers said they needed more time to make changes to their electronic order routing systems to track the orders  The disclosure rules are now set to take effect in 2020  Brett Redfearn  the SEC s director of trading and markets  said in March that enhanced disclosures would  enable greater transparency into any potential trade offs being made between payment for order flow and execution quality   YEARS IN THE MAKING Payment for order flow is a growing revenue stream in an ultra competitive industry in the middle of a price war  But it is not the biggest source of income for online brokers  and not all accept it  Fidelity  for one  does not   Schwab made  139 million from selling its customers  orders in 2018  up 22  from the previous year  according to a regulatory filing  TD Ameritrade was paid  458 million for customer orders in its last fiscal year  up from  320 million the year before  according to a filing  The move to zero commissions has been decades in the making  The online brokers  use of technology to place orders instead of relying on traders on a trading floor allowed them to cut costs while speeding up the process  making it easier for everyone to buy and sell stocks  But in more recent years  online brokers like Schwab and TD Ameritrade have come under mounting competition from startup fintech companies that have embraced payment for order flow as a way to cut out trading commissions entirely  Menlo Park  California based brokerage Robinhood launched in late 2014 with the stated mission of democratizing access to the financial markets  By the end of last year  it said it had signed up 6 million user accounts   Other startups have followed suit and many  like Robinhood  offer things like free trading of cryptocurrencies  along with stocks and ETFs  to help attract younger investors  
Now that the larger brokers have followed suit  analysts have said they expect more mergers and acquisitions as the erosion in commission revenues makes scale more important ",2019-10-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-online-brokers-still-profiting-from-dumb-money-1993431,1993431

10470,231985,NDAQ,Baidu  Live Nation Entertainment  CME  MarketAxess And Nasdaq Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 15  2019    Shares of Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU   as the Bull of the Day  Live Nation Entertainment   NYSE LYV   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CME Group   NASDAQ CME    MarketAxess Holdings Inc    NASDAQ MKTX   and Nasdaq Inc    NASDAQ NDAQ   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  It s been a tough year for Chinese companies  As the US   China trade war dragged on  US equities have still performed well with the S P 500 sitting near all time record highs   up more than 22  in 2019  Shares of Chinese technology giant Baidu have been headed in the opposite direction for most of the year After topping out at nearly  280 share in May of 2018  Baidu s share price had declined 62  to  107 last week  A combination of stale results and a slowing Chinese economy   along with the trade war   weighed heavily on Baidu shares  Baidu doesn t sell any goods that are directly subject to tariffs  but the effect on the entire Chinese economy had reduced quantities and the prices of the company s most profitable offerings After an excellent earnings report last week however  it appears fortunes may be changing for the company many investors refer to as the  Chinese Google  NASDAQ GOOGL    making the recent share price declines a buying opportunity The shares rallied 15  quickly to  125  but have since settled back a bit to  118 A slew of analyst upgrades and positive earnings revisions after the most recent report earn Baidu a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  A decade ago  Baidu grew dramatically as the largest Chinese internet search and advertising company in a country with a rapidly expanding middle class that in many cases was utilizing the internet for the first time  Over the past few years however  Baidu has seen revenues stagnate amid increased competition and deteriorating Chinese economic conditions  The company recorded it s only quarterly loss ever in Q1 2019 After several quarters of flat or declining sales  Q3 marked a turnaround with revenues up 7  over the previous quarter and adjusted net earnings of  1 76 share after one time items  That was 40  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 25 share The company also raised guidance  increasing sales estimates for the next quarter to a range of  3 78B to  4 02B  They didn t forecast a net earnings figure  but based on the revenue increases   the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for full year 2019 has risen 27  from  4 40 share to  5 58 share in the past 30 days  That s still well off the  9 64 share Baidu earned in 2018   but keep in mind that the stock traded at more than double the current level in 2018 Over the same 30 day period  2020 expectations have grown even more   from  5 97 shareall the way to  8 45  If Baidu continues to recover  there s significant room for share price appreciation  If you ve purchased tickets to live entertainment recently  you probably have mixed feelings about Live Nation Entertainment  The company s business model of combining a patchwork of regional concert promoters into a single national entity has certainly increased the number and variety of acts that are available to the average fan On the other hand  Live nation s position as gatekeeper of the biggest events  as well as owning Ticketmaster and many of the venues where concerts are held means that concertgoers are paying significantly more for tickets than they were a decade ago Live nation does a remarkable amount of business  Through the third quarter of 2019  they had sold 92 million tickets and had taken in  8 7 billion in revenue  Those are hugely impressive numbers  but unfortunately for Live Nation  not a lot of that revenue makes it to the bottom line The total cost of putting on the shows eats up about 75  of revenue  and that s before Selling  general and Administrative expense  interest and other costs Though the company regularly adds acts and venues and sees increases in Ticketmaster fee revenue and in person sales of food  beverages and merchandise to concertgoers  operating income so far in 2019 has been just  408 million   less than 5  of gross sales With a share price that has outpaced sales and earnings growth over the past decade as it rallied from less than  3 share in 2019 to around  65 share today  Live nation is a truly dismal value opportunity with a 12M forward P E Ratio of 430X Yes  that s not a misprint  The share price multiple is 430 times how much Live Nation is forecast to earn over the next year In full year 2019  the company is expected to earn just  0 15 share and 2020 doesn t get much better with estimates of  0 42 share for the entire year  Those estimates have been reduced from  0 28 share and  0 62 share  respectively  over the past 30 days Four negative revisions in the past month help earn Live Nation a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The style scores are equally ugly  with an F in Value  a D in Growth  an F in momentum and an overall VGM score of F  That s just about the worst report card we give out Live nation is also currently a component of the Zacks Short List  an algorithmic trading service that uses a proprietary system to analyze thousands of stocks and find the ten with the least promising financial prospects  It s not a place you want to find your stocks If a company with a near monopoly control over a large portion of live entertainment events and almost  12 billion in annual revenue can t figure out how to earn more than  0 15 share  they don t deserve your hard earned investment dollars  Shares of Live Nation could fall by 50  and they d still be significantly overvalued by any reasonable measure You might be stuck paying Live Nation an exorbitant service charge when you buy tickets and  14 for a draft beer at the show  but you re certainly not stuck investing in the shares   and you shouldn t Additional content CME Group  CME  to Launch Bitcoin Options in 2020CME Groupannounced the launch of

10550,232065,NDAQ,Major Brokers To Form New Exchange To Rival Nasdaq  NYSE,opinion,"A group of nine Wall Street biggies and other retail broker dealers are coming together to launch a new national securities exchange   MEMX or Members Exchange   with a view to cut costs that other exchanges charge for services 
Bank of America   NYSE BAC    E TRADE Financial   NASDAQ ETFC    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS    TD Ameritrade   NASDAQ AMTD    UBS Group AG  Virtu Financial  Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW   Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments are the names involved in the venture 
An application to operate as a national securities exchange is likely to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early 2019  However  the approval receiving process can be time consuming  and thus the exchange is less likely to go live before 2020 
Shares of Intercontinental Exchange   NYSE ICE    owner of NYSE  and Nasdaq   NASDAQ NDAQ   have dropped 4 7  and 2 9   respectively  since Monday after news of the rival exchange surfaced 
Exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq generate revenues by charging brokers for trading data  without which traders cannot conduct business  Thus  these firms are forming a new platform that will have fewer and simpler order types at lower costs  Though it is not clear as to how low these costs might be  it is expected to have a significant impact on competition 
These financial firms have come together with an aim to boost competition  improve operational transparency  lower fixed costs and simplify the execution of equity trading in the United States 
Steve Quirk  executive vice president at TD Ameritrade believes that the new exchange initiative would transform markets for better  He said   All types of investors could benefit from this simplified investing experience that will foster competition and promote practices that put the needs of investors first  
 Participants in today s equity markets deserve an innovative alternative that is aligned with their interests  which is why we are pleased to support the launch of this new trading platform   said Vlad Khandros  managing director at UBS

10580,232095,NDAQ,5 Trade Ideas For Monday  ARNC  BIIB  GGG  JNJ  NDAQ,opinion,"Arconic Inc  NYSE ARNC 
Arconic   ARNC  made a top in January and then pulled back in two steps  It consolidated at the bottom for nearly 3 months before a reversal higher began  That move stalled as it reached the 1st step down and then pulled back into the end of October  Now it is at resistance with the RSI rising and the MACD about to turn positive  Look for a push over resistance to participate   
Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB 
Biogen   BIIB  gapped higher in July and ran  It gapped again two weeks later to a blow off top and then gapped down  After all that activity it then held steady in a range for two and a half months before dropping to fill the first gap  It bounced and recovered to test the bottom of the prior range and then pulled back  A touch at the 200 day SMA and it is now moving back over the prior high  The RSI is on the edge of a move into the bullish zone and the MACD is rising and now positive  Look for continuation to participate   
Graco Inc  NYSE GGG 
Graco   GGG  fell from a third tap at resistance in September and accelerated to the downside  It found a bottom 1 month later in October over 20  lower  The bounce from there was strong and reached the 50 day SMA before receding in a digestive move  Now it is back at that resistance  The RSI is rising and bullish with the MACD turning positive  Look for continuation to participate   
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ 
Johnson   Johnson   JNJ  rose from a pullback in October making a higher high as it moved into November  It topped out shortly after and retraced back to the prior high and the 50 day SMA before the latest move higher  Now it is at resistance with a RSI strong in the bullish zone and the MACD trying to cross up  Look for a push over resistance to participate higher

Nasdaq   NDAQ  had a strong run higher to a plateau over the summer  It started to pullback in September finding support and consolidating in October  It moved back higher and stalled at a lower high  A shallow pullback to the 50 day SMA was followed by a reversal and it is now back at that latest peak  The RSI is rising and bullish and the MACD is positive and moving up  Look for a push over resistance to participate   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with 1 month left in the year sees equities have given up most or all of their gains for the year  but are looking to start December moving higher  Perhaps a Santa Claus rally can repair some of the damage 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in the short term while Crude Oil pauses in its downtrend  The US Dollar Index is resuming the path higher while US Treasuries bounce in their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite is resuming its path lower while Emerging Markets pause in their downtrend 
Volatility looks to remain elevated but stable  putting light pressure on equities  The equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   IWM and QQQ  all showed great strength on the week and look to continue that into December  On the longer scale the QQQ has the most work to do to reverse the downtrend  while the IWM and SPY have stopped the bleeding for now  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

10602,232117,NDAQ,Blockchain Technology  No Longer Just For Cryptocurrencies ,opinion,"Blockchain technology  which allows information to be distributed on a digital ledger that details previous transactions but which cannot be copied  was originally pioneered by the developer of Bitcoin  Since its introduction however  blockchain s potential has been recognized by many outside the cryptocurrency arena and is being adopted across myriad industries 
  Executive Director of the Blockchain Research Institute  explains that blockchain is a vast  global database that s open to anyone or anything  It s not just a repository of information but can be used to safeguard anything of value money  titles  deeds  music  art  scientific discoveries  intellectual property  even election tallies  Cached material can be moved and stored securely and privately 
Tapscott  it s the technology most likely to change the next decade of business and will have implications far beyond financial services 

 On the blockchain  trust is established not by powerful intermediaries like banks  governments and technology companies  but through mass collaboration and clever code  Blockchains ensure integrity and trust between strangers  They make it difficult to cheat

Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil turns from an uptrend to consolidation  The US Dollar Index continues to move sideways while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets look to continue to consolidate  the Shanghai Composite at the retest of lows and Emerging Markets at their highs 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping pressure on the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show that the bleeding has stopped in the short run  but no strength for a reversal at this point  That said the longer trend remains to the upside  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

10666,232181,NDAQ,3 Ways Bitcoin Skeptics Can Leverage Blockchain,opinion,"Blockchain is causing massive disruption in the global economic landscape with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  Now  traditional financial institutions must take proactive steps to manage the evolution of money or watch their control over monetary supply fade away as cryptocurrency displace fiat currencies 
Bitcoin is probably the most recognized use of Blockchain technology and people buy the cryptocurrency to shift away from government s influence on the monetary policy  Bitcoin has rewarded brave investors and the NYSE Bitcoin Index is up by an incredible 501 1  year to date gains as seen in the chart below 

However  no week seems to pass by without Bitcoin being subject to vitriol  insult  outright condemnation by skeptics  JPMorgan s  NYSE JPM  Jamie Dimon has famously called Bitcoin a  fraud   the SEC has warned that Bitcoin is a commodity and not a currency  and China is cracking down on Bitcoin exchanges  The fact that Bitcoin s value is based on consensus and the fact that governments are yet to support the consensus has been one of the key reasons behind Bitcoin s gut wrenching volatility 
There s More To Blockchain Than Bitcoin
There s more to Blockchain than Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  If you are not comfortable with the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin  you can still find ways to invest in blockchain technology as the industry continues to grow 
Blockchain is changing the real estate landscape with solutions to tokenize real estate transactions with fractional ownership in real estate  Blockchain has shown an impressive ability to revolutionize the service industry with Smart Contracts that use blockchain based solutions to execute the terms of a contract  Ethereum for instance is built specifically for creating and executing smart contracts that are paid for by Ether  This piece provides insight into opportunities to invest in Blockchain without necessarily buying Bitcoin 
Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is on track to become of the biggest industries globally as the world continues to evolve into a digital based ecosystem with the Internet of things  Cybercriminals are fast  nimble  and innovative in finding ways to exploit internet based solutions for illicit gains  Malware  Ransomware  Phishing scams  DDoS attack  and malicious attacks are just few of the ways criminals could cripple the operations of businesses  organizations and governments 
Gladius plans to build a fully decentralized peer to peer platform where businesses can buy speedy content delivery and DDoS mitigation services  People can run the Gladius peer client on their computers  in the background  to monetize the underutilized bandwidth and spare storage as part of a pool providing unassailable protection for websites against DDoS attacks  and accelerate them at the same time  Hence  any cybercriminal intent on perpetrating a DDoS attack on a website protected by Gladius will need to identify and disable thousands  possibly millions  of computers and nodes  unlike a centralized solution  before they can execute the DDoS attack on their target 
DDoS attacks are very devastating  costly  and the current protections against them are very expensive  A 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn crashed CNN  Reddit  Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  among other for a full day resulting in billions of dollars in losses  Interestingly  the cost of services rendered by the existing DDoS protection is very expensive because you pay for protection all the same irrespective of whether you were hit or not 
Gladius is working on reducing the costs of protection against DDoS attacks while offering an impregnable protection against attacks  On Gladius  platform  clients only need to pay a minimum and incur extra costs when Gladius is actually deployed against DDoS attacks targeted at them  Gladius is doing a token sale in November  Because of the fact that DDoS attacks cost about  150 billion damage annually suggests that there s something in the market for investors 
Facilitating Stock Trading
Traditional Wall Street investors might want to consider putting their skepticism on Blockchain aside and pay special attention to how Blockchain technology can be used to revolutionize equities trading  Blockchain technology can be leveraged for ending the use of paper stock certificates and for speeding up transaction settlement times for stock trading 
In 2015  Nasdaq Inc   NASDAQ NDAQ  revealed that it had piloted the use of Blockchain technology for the issuance of the shares of a private company  You should note that NASDAQ is the second largest stock exchange in the world by market cap  after the NYSE  In a statement by Bod Greifeld  NASDAQ s CEO Through this initial application of blockchain technology  we begin a process that could revolutionize the core of capital markets infrastructure systems   NASDAQ also hopes to one day leverage blockchain for stock issuance and trading for public companies 
Investors may not want to invest in Bitcoin  but it would be foolhardy to ignore the potential that Blockchain holds for facilitating stock trading  The cost of trading such as transaction fees will be greatly reduced to increase investor returns  Transactional times will also be reduced in order to even the playing field for retail traders and high frequency traders 
Cloud Based Blockchain As A Service
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM  is one of the biggest mainstream supporters of Blockchain technology  Earlier in 2017  the firm launched its IBM Blockchain solution that helps businesses to digitalize their transaction workflows by building enterprise applications on IBM s cloud 
Las week  IBM and Stellar launched a Blockchain banking solution that can be used for moving money across 12  currency corridors  in the South Pacific  Jesse Lund  IBM s VP of Blockchain notes that Blockchain banking   is the next step in the evolution of blockchain technology  It s live money moving around a network  
Wal Mart Stores  NYSE WMT  is working on ways to leverage IBM s blockchain solution to use the technology to track inventory in its stores in a tamper proof decentralized platform  Everledger wants to reduce the logistics of identifying  authenticating  selling  and purchasing diamonds by using Blockchain to track who owns what diamond per time 
Ginni Rometty  CEO of IBM submits that Blockchain will play an important role for the company in reducing costs  creating new revenue streams  and helping it to build a competitive advantage in the industry  In her 2016 annual report  she notes that   Blockchain will do for trusted transactions what the Internet did for information  IBM is already working with more than 400 clients to pioneer blockchain for business  They include clients who manage foreign exchange settlements  smart contracts  identity management and trade finance but the potential goes well beyond financial services ",2017-10-19,Luis Aureliano,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-ways-to-bitcoin-skeptics-can-leverage-blockchain-as-an-investment-200219792,200219792

10722,232237,NDAQ,This Newest ETF May Be The Best Fund Yet,opinion,"TETF is the  ETF Industry Exposure   Financial Services ETF  
It is a bit over one week old
The concept is sublime 
If the execution is equally wonderful  TETF will be a big winner 

The idea behind the Industry ETF Exposure and Financial Services ETF  NYSE TETF  is simple  ETFs are the fastest growing investment category ever  From a single fund  the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY   in 1993  the number of ETFs now total over 6 000 different offerings 
ETFs have grown at an annual rate of more than 19 4  over the last decade and now have more than  3 8 trillion in assets worldwide  

Why not then first  design a passive index that tracks the biggest publicly traded ETF issuers  the exchanges that benefit from the highest volume of ETF trading  and the various service providers that serve the ETF industry and  second  create an ETF that tracks that index 
The first part was completed courtesy of the Toroso ETF Index  Rather than limit the index solely to those publicly traded firms that issue ETFs  the  fund sponsors    however  Toroso includes the financial services firms that provide distribution  custodianship  liquidity and data as well as the actual exchanges that process a higher amount of ETF trades 
The bad news is that  if you are looking for a pure play on ETF issuers  there is no index for that just yet  The good news is that you have far better diversification in an ETF that mirrors this index  which covers a lot of financial services providers as well 

The index is constructed in such a way that fully 50  of the portfolio is comprised of those firms that have  substantial participation  in the ETF marketplace and enjoy a  direct financial impact  from that participation  This tier places 6 25  of the portfolio in each of eight major players 

BlackRock  NYSE BLK 
Schwab  NYSE SCHW 
Invesco  NYSE IVZ 
State Street  NYSE STT 
Wisdom Tree  NASDAQ WETF 
MSCI  NYSE MSCI 
S P Global  NYSE SPGI   and
CBOE Holdings  NASDAQ CBOE 

This equally weighted tier is designed to capture those companies with the purest connection to the growth of the ETF industry   BlackRock alone  via their iShares subsidiary  has aggregated close to 40  of all US ETF assets   It also includes the CBOE  which is the dominant force in trading and indexing volatility and which derives substantial revenue from the ETF business 

The next 25  of the index is comprised of other companies that benefit from the growth of ETF trading but are not pure plays on the business  These firms still have  substantial participation  in the ETF marketplace but see a more  indirect financial impact  from their participation  Here we find seven companies that are equally weighted at 3 57  each  They are 

DST Systems Inc   NYSE DST    an ETF sponsor 
JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM    an ETF sponsor 
SEI Investments   NASDAQ SEIC    a services provider 
KCG Holdings Inc   NYSE KCG    a liquidity provider 
Virtu Financial Inc   NASDAQ VIRT    A liquidity provider 
Intercontinental Exchange Inc   NYSE ICE    an exchange 
Nasdaq Inc   NASDAQ NDAQ    an exchange 

This tier includes firms like JP Morgan  an ETF issuer that also has banking  investment banking  credit cards  and numerous other subsidiaries  KCG Holdings is an example of a company that is essential as a lead market maker and liquidity provider  However  their revenues from the growth of ETFs is only part of their primary business  They provide execution and transaction services for all securities  not just ETFs 
The next tier also has seven companies but these are weighted at just 2 14  each  These are firms with  moderate participation in the ETF industry with indirect financial impact to shareholders  
These seven are 

Ameriprise Financial Inc   NYSE AMP    an ETF sponsor 
Northern Trust Corp   NASDAQ NTRS    an ETF sponsor 
Virtus Investment Partners Inc   NASDAQ VRTS    an ETF sponsor 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp   NYSE BK    a service provider 
US Bancorp   NYSE USB    a service provider 
FactSet Research Systems Inc   NYSE FDS    an index and data provider   and
CME Group Inc   NASDAQ CME    an exchange 

The final tier  currently containing 15 companies  fills out the remaining 10  of the portfolio  Since they individually amount to less than a 1  impact to the index s performance  I won t list them all but this tier includes companies like Morningstar  NASDAQ MORN   TD Ameritrade  NASDAQ AMTD   Eaton Vance  NYSE EV   and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  
Finally  the index is rebalanced just twice a year  in June and December  and to be eligible for inclusion in the index  a company must have a free float adjusted market cap of  200 million or greater for initial and ongoing index inclusion  To make sure there is adequate liquidity  constituent securities must also have three month average daily turnover of a minimum of  1 million 
The only mutual fund  closed end fund or ETF to create a product using the Toroso ETF Index  so far   is the ETF Industry Exposure   Financial Services ETF  or TETF  Via TETF  we can enjoy all the benefits that ETFs offer  like improved liquidity  tax efficiency  and increased transparency  but we can now also do so while holding a comprehensive basket of the biggest and best beneficiaries of the product itself 
This targeted exposure to what I consider a serious growth venue is what sets TETF apart  Here is how the ETF breaks down its exposure on its website  tetfetf com  

And here is a more visual look at how these different categories are represented in the portfolio 

What could go wrong with TETF as an investment  It is currently difficult to find information on   but then it is only just a bit over one week old 
It is thinly traded   but I believe greater exposure in coming weeks will change that very quickly  Until then  enter limited orders  If you enter market orders  especially in size  don t be surprised if you are bringing sellers out of the woodwork who are only responding to your outsized offer 
TETF will only do exceptionally well as long as the market does well and as long as the trend away from open end mutual funds to ETFs continues  As investors have discovered to their consternation in every bear cycle  no matter the investment  stocks  mutual funds  closed end funds and ETFs all tend to decline 
There could easily be a major shakeout at some point of some of the sillier  narrower ETFs out there  It is natural for new funds  and companies  for that matter  to be formed all the time and for others to die on the vine all the time  If some of TETF s bigger players get greedy and stupid and introduce more funds that don t catch on  that mortality rate will increase 
Having said all that  I believe the growth in ETF assets under management will increase at a very robust rate  I believe other nations and regions with well developed exchanges and markets will soon discover the benefits of ETFs 
As a result  given the caveats above  I still see TETF as a way to own financials  but financials with a special twist not just financials but the growth that comes from companies that directly benefit from the expansion of the ETF marketplace  I began buying TETF this week for my family accounts and our managed portfolio clients

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  This week s list contains the first five below to get you started early  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading in to December Options Expiration and the FOMC meeting sees US Equities looking strong but perhaps extended on the short term 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue its downtrend while Crude Oil continues to move higher  The US Dollar Index also looks better to the upside while US Treasuries continue to be biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both are biased to the upside with risk Emerging Markets being only a short term move 
Volatility looks to remain subdued and abnormally low keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their short term charts suggest possible exhaustion as they are over sold  but longer term they look very strong  The exception is the QQQ which has been stuck in a range but is now at the top end  Perhaps it will benefit from a pullback in the other index ETFs  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Lockheed Martin  LMT  had a strong trend higher end in August  The pullback found support at the 200 day SMA in October and it reversed higher  That move back up made a higher high as it stalled in November  It consolidated there for a couple of weeks and then pulled back again  this time to the 100 day SMA  It had been consolidating in a range over that for 2 and a half months until pushing higher Friday  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone and the MACD is crossed up  positive and rising  Look for follow through to participate higher   
Nasdaq Inc  NASDAQ NDAQ 
Nasdaq  NDAQ  broke above consolidation in July and rose to a high in August  A shallow pullback and retest of the high that failed led to a double top and move lower to a bottom in November retracing 78 6  of the move up  It confirmed a double bottom then and moved higher  retesting the August high again  The sharp pullback in a bull flag lasted until Friday when it broke the flag higher  The RSI is turning back higher in the bullish zone and the MACD is avoiding a cross down  Look for continuation to participate higher   
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into February Options Expiration week sees the equity markets looking strong if not moving towards getting overheated 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil churns marking time  The US Dollar Index is looking stronger while US Treasuries consolidate in their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both look strong and ready for more upside 
Volatility looks to remain at extremely low levels keeping the wind at the back of the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts all look great and ready for more upside in the longer timeframe but the SPY and QQQ are getting a bit hot in the short term and may need a rest  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

10756,232271,NDAQ,The Greatest Buy And Hold Stock Investor Of All Time,opinion," 0     70 Year Investment Into Walgreens 2     The Ultimate Buy   Hold Investor or Just Luck  5     Can You Buy   Hold Forever and Should You  7     Stock Screener  Long Term Holdings 9     Tracey s Top Stock Picks 14     Episode Roundup  Welcome to Episode  46 of the Value Investor Podcast
Every week  Tracey Ryniec  the editor of Zacks   shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks 
Recently  the wrote about 98 year old Russ Gremel  a Chicago attorney who had donated  2 million to the Illinois Audubon Society 
The catch 
He obtained the money by investing  1 000 in Walgreens stock 70 years ago 
Mr  Gremel may be one of the greatest  buy and hold  investors of all time 
The average length of time most investors hold onto a stock or a mutual fund is just 3 years  If you ve even held a decade  that is considered a long term shareholder 
He held through the super bear market of the 1970s  the 1980s 90s mega bull and then the recent Great Recession sell off  That takes a lot of guts 
Luck or Skill 
Mr  Gremel s story is a feel good story because the investment turned out well  Walgreens is still in business all these years later  when many of its peers are not 
Additionally  according to YahooFinance  the stock is up over 8 000  since 1985 
Was Mr  Gremel a good investor  or did he just get lucky when he chose Walgreens 
Luck does play a part in investing  of course  But for every Walgreens there is a Montgomery Wards  That s why you should keep a diverse portfolio  Holding onto just one stock for 70 years would be considered a risky strategy 
Can You Buy and Hold a Stock for Forever 
Like any stock investment  you should always be evaluating your companies no matter how long you intend to hold them 
Use the Zacks Rank to look for rising earnings estimates  Check to make sure earnings are growing  Listen to conference calls and stay up to date on company news 
Businesses change  Just ask Kodak and Sears 
Don t get caught unaware 
5 Companies That Fit the Buy and Hold Criteria
Tracey did a screen for Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3  Hold  stocks with P Es under 18  She also sought EPS growth of at least 10  and a dividend over 1  
Dividends are a key component to buy and hold because  if they re re invested  they compound 
1       Tyson Foods   NYSE TSN   is one of the largest beef  pork and poultry producers in America  It trades with a forward P E of just 12 2 and is expected to grow earnings by 14  this year 
2      Thor Industries   NYSE THO   just had a record third quarter as RV sales were up 56 9   Earnings are expected to jump 33  this year 
3      Nasdaq   NASDAQ NDAQ   just increased its quarterly dividend by 19   It yields 1 8   Earnings are expected to rise 11 8  in 2017 
4      MetLife   NYSE MET   was founded in 1868 yet it s still expected to grow earnings by 16 5  this year  It s cheap  with a forward P E of just 9 9 and it pays a dividend yielding 3  
5      Celanese   NYSE CE   is over 100 years old but is expected to grow earnings by 10 5  this year  The specialty chemical maker has a forward P E of just 12 3 
If you re going to buy and hold  buy companies in the basics like the examples above  food  insurance  chemicals  finance  
And remember  past performance is no guarantee of future results

10800,232315,NDAQ,5 Top Trade Ideas For The Week  COH  DVA  ETFC  NDAQ  UNP,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Coach Inc  NYSE COH 

Coach  COH  continued higher off of a low in September 2015  until reaching a high in April  It pulled back from there to the 100 day SMA and found support  creating a new consolidation zone  Last week it moved back to the top of the range on a strong day Friday  As it did the RSI is in the bullish zone and rising and the MACD is moving higher  The Bollinger Bands  are also opening to the upside   
DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc  NYSE DVA

E TRADE Financial Corporation  NASDAQ ETFC 

E Trade Financial  ETFC  was in a slow rising channel until it gapped lower with the Brexit vote  A sharp 2 day fall found support nearly 20  lower and has been consolidating in a wide range since  Friday saw a higher high in the RSI and a MACD move to where a cross up is imminent  Look for a move over resistance to participate in the upside   
Nasdaq Inc  NASDAQ NDAQ 

Nasdaq  NDAQ  moved higher off of the August low and consolidated for 3 and a half months before moving up again  It has consolidated for nearly 4 months since the last move now  It ended Friday at the top of the latest consolidation with support for more upside from a rising and bullish RSI and MACD  Look for a break of consolidation to participate to the upside

Another pullback found support and rebounded to that prior high and then it did it again in June  ending Friday with a push to a higher high  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is crossed and rising  Look for continued upward movement Monday to participate to the upside   
Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which heading into July Options Expiration week sees the equity indexes are strong and looking for new highs 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue higher but perhaps see a short term pullback first  similar to the picture for Crude Oil  The US Dollar Index looks to continue higher toward the top of the broad consolidation while US Treasuries are continue higher but with some caution as they are getting extended 
The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets both look better to the upside in their consolidation ranges  Volatility looks to remain subdued and possible moving lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  
Their charts agree  with the SPY looking for new all time highs quickly  the IWM chasing and the QQQ looking to break a range by making a new 2016 high  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

10818,232333,NDAQ,Major Securities Exchange Picks With Rising August Volumes,opinion,Despite a cloud of uncertainty looming over the global market environment due to rapidly changing climatic conditions   storming the industrial space with consecutive catastrophic disasters Hurricanes Harvey and Irma   and the palpable disagreement among the Fed officials over how quickly to raise interest rates  the performance of some pivotal players in the Securities and Exchanges industry has shown a ray of hope Some major players of Securities and Exchanges industry have been successfully recording robust trading volumes and August was no exception   We expect to see these key players generating solid trading volumes in the near term as well Momentum to Continue The key players in the Securities and Exchanges industry are largely dependent on their product and service portfolios to churn out revenues  The major services include trade execution  clearing  settlement services for securities and commodity contracts  listing services as well as trading and clearing systems services  There are other sources of revenues that might include data products  financial indexes  along with information and public company services In a highly competitive industry  demand is fueled by investor confidence  dependent on the overall growth of the industry itself  Interestingly  the individual exchanges  profitability rests on maximization of transaction and clearing fees while keeping transaction based expenses low  Such organic growth will help the individual exchanges drive their revenues  which in turn will continue to fuel increasing trading volumes  This makes us hopeful for the future  which has a high possibility to see major players in the industry generating substantially high trading volumes This apart  the individual exchanges rely heavily on their diverse product offerings to drive their overall growth  With introduction of new products  which not only cater to the demands of the derivatives industry but also complement the core product lines  the key players are expected to strengthen their market position and global reach  To that end  the companies remain committed toward investing in new product extensions and offerings to boost overall growth  thereby creating an opportunity for trading volumes to thrive The individual exchanges are focused on building a strategic economic market model through technological advances and upgrade of diverse service and product offerings to help them stay ahead and maintain the competitive streak amid the changing industry dynamics Interestingly  some leading players in the industry have been making substantial efforts to expand product portfolio via prudent acquisitions  which in turn will aid them to retain their market share  expand product lines as well as widen global footprint  For instance  the acquisition of Bats Global Markets by CBOE Holdings on Feb 28  2017  has enabled the latter to broaden and diversify its product portfolio Also  on Jul 5  2017  Intercontinental Exchange  Inc    NYSE ICE   has purchased the remaining 20  stake in ICE Endex shares from N V  Nederlandse Gasunie  The buyout adds capabilities to Intercontinental Exchange s European gas and power portfolio We wait to see if new product initiatives and global presence help these major players in the Securities and Exchanges industry to post high trading volumes in the future The Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry is currently ranked at  105  which lies in the upper half of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus

10825,232340,NDAQ,Will The Nasdaq 100 Gain Traction From Reshuffling ,opinion,"NASDAQ OMX Group Inc   NASDAQ NDAQ  announced the re ranking of its NASDAQ 100 index  which is the leading global index that comprises non financial securities based on market capitalization  The annual review is an attempt to strengthen its non transaction base revenue 
Launched in January 1985 and traded as  NDX   several small   mid  and large cap  fast growing companies of the core trade sector such as computer hardware and software  telecommunications  retail and wholesale trade and biotechnology have found places in the NASDAQ 100 index  These U S  and internationally based companies are ranked on their market value and solid growth history such as Apple Inc   AAPL   Comcast Corp   CMCSA  and Adobe Systems Inc   NASDAQ ADBE  
The technological  basically non financial  stocks are traded as options derivatives against the NASDAQ 100 that allow the investor to earn from changes in the index value with a limited amount of money at risk  Meanwhile  the premiere set of high ranked stocks that the index holds makes it the bellwether index of such tech stock portfolios 
Furthermore  the NASDAQ market data used in the ranking review is updated with total shares outstanding at the end of October every year and is submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission in a public filing  by the end of November 
Individual investors can access this index through exchange traded funds  ETFs  like the NASDAQ 100 Trust  known as PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   The NASDAQ 100 is also the benchmark index for other popular ETFs 
Major Additions and Deletions
Accordingly  this year  NASDAQ has added about 44 rapid growth biotechnology companies  along with software  airline and manufacturing companies like Electronic Arts Inc   EA   American Airlines Group Inc   AAL  and Lam Research Corp   LRCX   respectively 
Notably  NASDAQ also added lower tier shares of some of the high potential stocks like the Class B shares of Twenty First Century Fox Inc  NASDAQ FOX  and Class C shares of Liberty Global plc  At the same time  a handful of underperforming stocks like Expedia Inc   EXPE   F5 Networks Inc   FFIV  and Maxim Integrated Products Inc   MXIM  were dropped from the NASDAQ 100 list 
Growth Rationale for NDX
Through this index  NASDAQ incorporated a multiple asset class that diversifies risk and maximizes return  Moreover  annual re ranking helps maintain strategic discipline and firmness in this index portfolio 
The reshuffling further signals the company s promptness to capitalize on the volatility that the markets offer from time to time  and gain from a growth driven portfolio  These efforts will not only accelerate NASDAQ s operating leverage but also improve volumes and competitiveness 
The efficiency of the NASDAQ 100 index or NDX is also reflected by its consistently solid performance  yielding one year and five year returns of about 20 3  and 132   respectively  This is against the S P 500 index that clocked one year and five year returns of about 12 1  and 79 8   respectively 
The solid performance and leading position of the NASDAQ 100 index also indicates the investors  growing risk appetite that equates to affinity for high growth potential assets  Economic recovery and rising volatility has opened up new avenues of growth in the tech sector  given the increased listings witnessed in tech and digital commerce startups lately 
Going forward  we believe the rapidity of tech companies will continue to boost investors  sentiment in the NASDAQ 100 index  thereby auguring a healthy growth outlook ",2014-12-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-nasdaq-100-gain-traction-from-reshuffling-236032,236032

Agrium Inc  NYSE AGU 
Agrium  AGU  has moved sideways in a consolidation over 100 since pulling back from the high to start March  It ended last week with a touch of the 200 day SMA  the first time since December  Oh and that was the start of the last leg higher  The RSI continues to hold mildly bullish while the MACD is crossing down  a bearish signal  Look to follow the move away from the support level  whichever way it goes 
Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc  NASDAQ BMRN 
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals  BMRN  broke above an ascending triangle in June  It retested the break out level and then rose just shy of the tart on the pattern  A slight pullback to the 20 day SMA and now there is a tight consolidation range building  The RSI is turned down but remains bullish while the MACD has crossed down  rather un bullish  A move to new highs or below the 20 day SMA is a trading opportunity 
The Hain Celestial Group Inc  NASDAQ HAIN 
Hain Celestial  HAIN  has been steadily rising since September 2014  The latest price action sees it consolidating under resistance at 69 with tightening Bollinger Bands  after a leg higher from the rising trend support  The RSI is rolling over though it remains in the bullish zone  while the MACD is crossed down and falling  Watch for a break of the 20 day SMA or a move over resistance 
Landstar System Inc  NASDAQ LSTR 
Landstar System  LSTR  was on the radar  as it consolidated at resistance  Friday broke that resistance to the upside but then pulled back from the high print intraday as it met the February high  Despite the long upper shadow  the Bollinger Bands are opening to the upside while the RSI is bullish and the MACD crossed up and rises  All are bullish signals  and you now have a natural stop area 
The NASDAQ OMX Group Inc  NASDAQ NDAQ 
Nasdaq OMX  NDAQ  has been trending higher since October  but with some strong pullbacks along the way  Regardless  the series of higher highs and higher lows continues  The price action to close last week saw a test of the May high and move above resistance before pulling back  The Bollinger Bands are opening higher and the RSI is in the bullish zone with a rising MACD  All support more upside price action

10833,232348,NDAQ,Top Trade Ideas For The Week November 23  2015  NDAQ,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ   makes no pretense of having a need for market makers  This market exchange is fully automated and has been so since the 80 s  The only reason they seem to have a visual office space in Times Squares seems to be to have their backdrop used as a television studio 
The stock price has been doing very well lately  It barely had a hiccup during the August market correction  and then even less in September  Since the August stumble it has risen 22   Not a bad place to hide out the last few months 
But the chart looks good for more upside right now  After a consolidation at 60 the back half of October  the price pulled back slightly  Last week saw that retreat reverse and march back up to resistance at 60 again  The bull flag created on the pullback can be used to measure a target to the upside of 67 
The momentum indicators look favorable  The RSI is moving back higher after holding in the bullish zone  while the MACD is about to cross up  The Bollinger Bands  had squeezed and are now opening to allow the upside advance 
The options chains show a potential hurdle though  The December options have large open interest at the 50  55 and 60 Strikes  without much anywhere else  With all this open interest at and below price it may be hard to move higher near expiry  Further out the options are much less active with the March options  beyond the January 28th report date  showing big open interest at the 50 and 55 Put Strikes 
Nasdaq OMX  Ticker   NDAQ
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 60 with a stop at 56  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 60 and add a December 60 55 Put Spread   1 40   Adding protection to the stock trade 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the December 60 Calls   1 30    A stock substitution trade  with defined risk 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the January 60 bullish Risk Reversal  free    A highly levered trade looking for the upside to continue

10841,232356,NDAQ,IPO Look   BATS Global Markets,opinion,Based in Lenexa  Kansas  BATS Global Markets  proposed BATS  scheduled a  107 million IPO with a market capitalization of  809 million at a price range mid point of  17 for Friday  March 23  2012 WHZ is one of six IPOs scheduled for this week    Nine more on deck for the week of March 26 SUMMARYBATS develops and operates electronic

during a time when its overall market suffered respective declines of 11  and 4  respectively for 2010 and 2011 CONCLUSIONOn a price to book basis BATs is expected to IPO at a premium to both NYX and NDAQ At the price range mid point BATS would be priced closer to NYX than NDAQ in the terms of P E multiples Sector stocks have increased somewhat since the In this fairly warm IPO market for technology companies  BATS appears to be a buy on the IPO  and depending on where it trades may be interesting in the IPO after market BUSINESSBATS is an innovative global financial technology company that develops and operates electronic markets for the trading of listed cash equity securities in the United States and Europe and listed equity options in the United States  Unlike traditional market operators  BATS is a technology company at its core BATS developed  owns and operates the BATS trading platform  With the exception of Chi X Europe which will be transitioned to BATS platform during 2012  BATS proprietary platform powers all of its markets and is designed to offer one of the fastest and most reliable trading systems available BATS is third largest exchange operator in the United States after NYSE Euronext and The NASDAQ OMX Group  Inc  BATS also executes the largest notional value of pan European equities traded by a single market operator through two Multilateral Trading Facilities  MTFs  For the year ended December 31  2011  BATS had an 11 3  share of the U S  equity market and a 3 1  share of the U S  equity options market BATS has captured market share during a time when its overall market suffered respective declines of 11  and 4  respectively for 2010 and 2011 DIVIDEND POLICYOn February 22  2012 BATS approved a cash dividend of  100 million to stockholders ofrecord as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the closing of the IPO  The dividend is conditioned upon the successful completion of this offering  and purchasers in this offering will not be entitled to the dividend No further dividends planned  DUAL STOCK CLASSESClass A common stock has one vote per share Class B common stock has two and one half votes per share Class A common stock will have 34 million shares Class B common stock will have 13 3 million share HISTORYFounded in 2005 with 13 initial employees  BATS became profitable within first 2 years BATS was founded as an alternative to the New York Stock Exchange  and The NASDAQ Stock Market in response to increased consolidation among U S  listed cash equity market centers  In January 2006  BATS launched an electronic communication network  or ECN  a type of alternative trading system  or ATS  which initially focused on the trading of NASDAQ listed securities  BATS began trading in American Stock Exchange  now NYSE Amex  listed securities in May 2006 and in NYSE listed securities in February 2007  In March 2008  BATS decided to enter the European markets by launching an MTF to compete on a pan European basis against the incumbent securities exchanges  formally launching BATS Europe in October 2008  In November 2008  we converted its ECN to a national securities exchange  BZX  which allowed BATS to participate in and earn market data fees from the U S  tape plans  reduce clearing costs and operate a primary listings business  In February 2010  BATS expanded into a new asset class by offering trading of listed equity options on BZX  In order to grow U S  market share  in October 2010  BATS launched BYX  a second national securities exchange for trading listed cash equity securities  In November 2011  BATS acquired Chi X Europe and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of BATS Global Markets  Inc  In December 2011  BATS launched a primary listings business in the United States on BZX OPERATIONSIn the United States  BATS operates two national securities exchanges  BZX and BYX  Both trade listed cash equity securities and exchange traded products  such as exchange traded funds  or ETFs  but each targets different market segments by offering different pricing alternatives  BZX also operates a market for trading listed equity options  In Europe  BATS MTFs operate two displayed books and offer trading in listed cash equity securities from within 25 European indices  in addition to ETFs  exchange traded commodities and international depositary receipts  The BATS platform is designed to facilitate price discovery by encouraging the quoting of competitive  displayed prices  BATS platform also offers opportunities to post undisplayed  or  dark   trading interest on our U S  and European order books  and in Europe  we operate two dark pools MISSIONBATS principal objective is to make markets better by minimizing inefficiencies and mitigating trade execution risk for market participants  BATS minimizes inefficiencies in part by offering low cost  rapid  trade execution  For example  during the second half of 2011 BATS net capture rate in the U S  equities market was 56  to 68  of the rate reported by NYSE Euronext s and NASDAQ OMX Group s U S  equities operations  while BATS net capture rate in the European listed equity securities market was 15  of the rate reported by the London Stock Exchange s European equities operations  During the fourth quarter of 2011  BATS net capture rate in the U S  listed equity options market was 25  to 28  of the rate reported by NYSE Arca  NYSE Amex  NASDAQ Options Market and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  Mitigates RiskBATS mitigates trade execution risk through offering ultra low latency order handling through its trading system  In particular  by offering ultra low latency order handling  members can very quickly place  modify or cancel orders on markets  This ability gives our members greater control over their orders  enabling them to rapidly respond to changing market conditions and mitigate trade execution risk MARKET SHARE90 7  of BATS total revenues came from trading of listed cash equities securities in the United States for the year ended December 31  2011  In Europe  for the eleven months ended November 30  2011  BATS had a 5 7  share of European trading in the securities available for trading on BATS Europe On November 30  2011  BATS acquired Chi X Europe  the operator of the largest pan European MTF  For the eleven months ended November 30  2011  Chi X Europe had an 18 4  share of European trading in the securities available for trading on Chi X Europe  For the month ended December 31  2011  BATS Chi X Europe had a 25 4  share of European trading in the securities available for trading on BATS Chi X Europe  making it the largest pan European equities trading venue  Pro forma for the acquisition of Chi X Europe and assuming BATS had acquired the business on January 1  2011  for the year ended December 31  2011 BATS would have derived 84 1  of total revenues from the trading of listed cash equities securities in the United States  5 8  of total revenues from the trading of listed equity options in the United States and 10 1  of total revenues from the trading of listed cash equities securities in Europe  BATS also would have had a 24 1  share of European trading in the securities available for trading on BATS Chi X Europe during 2011 STRATEGIC INVESTORSBATS generates a significant percentage of total revenues from  and are provided with significant liquidity in its markets by  customers who are affiliates of its strategic investors Those investors are not contractually obligated to continue to use BATS services or purchase BATS products Those investors also use the services of BATS competitors For the years 2011  2010 and 2009  29 4   31 7  and 29 8  of BATS total revenues  respectively  were generated by affiliates of BATS strategic investors  Page 22None of the strategic investors accounted for more than 10  of BATS total revenues during the years 2011  2010 or 2009  For the years 2011  2010 and 2009  31 3   41 8  and 53 7  of total cost of revenues  respectively  were generated by affiliates of BATS strategic investors  In addition  affiliates of BATS strategic investors also provide BATS with liquidity for which BATS provides a rebate For the years 2011  2010 and 2009  an affiliate of one of BATS strategic investors accounted for 13 2   31 0  and 51 0  respectively  of total liquidity rebates paid None of BATS customers is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use BATSr services or purchase BATS products  In addition  affiliates of BATS strategic investors and other customers have made  and may continue to make  investments in businesses that directly compete with BATS  BATS customers also trade  and will continue to trade  on markets operated by competitors SEASONALITYBATS experiences seasonal fluctuations  reflecting reduced trading activity generally during the third quarter of each year and during the last month of the year  As a result  operating results for the third or fourth quarter of any year may not be indicative of the results BATS expects for the full year INDUSTRY TRENDSSignificant regulatory and technological developments have transformed the markets in which BATS operates and have been the primary drivers of BATS growth and development   U S  Listed Cash Equity Securities  Several regulatory developments  together with innovations in technology and improvements in the speed of communication  have fundamentally changed the way U S  listed cash equity markets operate  Notable developments that encouraged the creation of alternative markets  like BATS original ECN  included the adoption of the  order handling  rules in 1996  which facilitated the growth of ECNs as alternatives to national securities exchanges for displaying and executing orders the move to decimal pricing in 2000  which resulted in narrower trading spreads  providing automated market makers with an advantage over traditional market makers  andthe adoption of Regulation NMS in 2005  which provided price protection for each exchange s best displayed quotes that are electronically accessible for immediate trade execution  and resulted in a dramatic shift to electronic trading as exchanges automated their trading systems to take advantage of this price protection   European Listed Equity Securities  The implementation of the Market in Financial Instruments Directive  or MiFID  in 2007 marked a fundamental change in the European market for trading listed cash equity securities  MiFID was designed to increase competition in pan European trading and authorized the creation of MTFs  In particular  to create competition among markets  MiFID abolished the  concentration rule   which required firms to route orders only to national stock exchanges  and extended the concept of  passporting   which allowed firms authorized to carry on business in one European Economic Area  or EEA  member state to carry on business in other EEA member states   U S  Listed Equity Options  The most significant recent changes within the U S  listed equity options market have been the move to penny increment price quotes and the shift away from the traditional pricing model  pursuant to which both sides pay a fee  for executing trades  The conversion of the U S  listed equity options market from nickel  or dime increment price quotes to penny increment price quotes began in January 2007 and has contributed to significant growth in overall options market volume  particularly among electronic traders  Additionally  the traditional exchange pricing model in the U S  listed equity options market  pursuant to which both sides of a transaction generally pay a fee to the exchanges  is increasingly being supplanted by a pricing model common in the U S  listed cash equities market that we believe encourages more aggressive competition and better price discovery PRICING ADVANTAGESSignificant Operating Leverage  The scalability of BATStechnology platform and the efficiency of BATS operations allows the company to continue to grow with limited additional capital investment  BATS uses technology to leverage its products and employees across multiple asset classes and geographies  As a result  BATS is able to operate with lower overhead than many incumbent exchanges  In addition  as a new business  BATS is not burdened by legacy infrastructure  With fewer than 170 employees globally as of December 31  2011  BATS has captured substantial market share from traditional exchanges in the United States and Europe while maintaining substantially lower fixed costs Due to operating leverage  BATS is able to profitably employ an aggressive  low spread pricing strategy  which BATS believes provides an important competitive advantage  In addition  BATS has employed innovative  and in some cases  disruptive pricing strategies to increase market share  To drive market share  BATS implemented strategic pricing changes in its U S  Equities segment in July 2011  through which BATS recognized  14 6 million more in net revenues during the year as a result of an increased net capture rate  These changes included the implementation of a tiered pricing structure that not only contributed to higher market share  but also resulted in a higher net capture rate  Had BATS implemented this change for the full year and assuming no change in volume  this would have resulted in an incremental  12 1 million more in net revenues  BATS also made a pricing change in its U S  Options segment in August 2011 through which it recognized  5 3 million more in net revenues  Had we implemented this change for the full year and assuming no change in volume  BATS would have resulted in an incremental  6 2 million more in net revenues COMPETITIONMarket participants now have multiple venues for the execution of orders  In addition to national securities exchanges  in the United States  these venues include numerous ATSs  many of which operate as  dark pools  and broker dealers who internalize orders for execution  In Europe  these alternate venues include MTFs that operate  lit  books and or  dark pools   broker crossing networks and other broker dealers who internalize orders for execution BATS competes in the U S  listed cash equity securities market against NYSE Euronext  NYX   NASDAQ OMX  NDAQ   Direct Edge  other regional exchanges and several ATSs  In Europe  major competitors include London Stock Exchange  NYSE Euronext  Deutsche B rse  NASDAQ OMX  SIX Swiss Exchange and BME  as well as Turquoise  BATS competes in the United States in listed equity options against CBOE  NYSE Euronext  NASDAQ OMX  ISE and BOX In the United States  the competition among exchanges and other execution venues has become more intense with regulatory changes  The U S  listed cash equity securities marketplace has evolved dramatically in recent years following the SEC s adoption of Regulation NMS  BATS competes in the U S  listed cash equity securities market against NYSE Euronext  NASDAQ OMX  Direct Edge  other regional exchanges and several alternative trading systems  or ATSs  Market participants now have multiple venues for the execution of orders  including national securities exchanges as well as numerous over the counter options  including ATSs operating  dark pools  that do not publicly display quotations  ECNs and broker dealers who internalize orders  For example  dark pool venues compete with BATS by offering low cost executions and differ from lit ATSs and MTFs in the degree of transparency with respect to quotes and trades they offer and in restrictions on who may access these systems  Unlike  lit  venues that publicly display orders  dark pools do not display orders publicly or privately  In addition  while dark pools are required to publicly report trade executions  unlike lit venues that are national securities exchanges  such as BZX and BYX  those public reports do not identify the dark pool responsible for the trade execution  Hence  dark pools are less transparent than lit venues  Moreover  dark pools below a certain size have discretion to offer access on discriminatory terms  effectively blocking access to certain types of market participants  These features of dark pools can appeal to trading participants who seek to minimize the public disclosure of their trading interest or limit the types of other trading participants that can access their orders  In addition  various broker dealers internalize their order flow or route their orders to third party ATSs  Based on publicly available data regarding reported trades  for the year ended December 31  2011  over the counter trading accounted for in excess of 30  of consolidated U S  equity volume  If over the counter trading expands further  it will adversely affect BATS market share in the United States EUROPE   MiFDsThe market for execution services within listed cash equity securities in Europe has become significantly more competitive since the Market in Financial Instruments Directive  or MiFID  went into effect in 2007  MiFID created a structure for pan European competition versus incumbent exchange monopolies throughout the European Union countries  As a result  new Multilateral Trading Facilities  MTFs   have emerged and have begun to capture significant market share from existing exchanges  particularly the London Stock Exchange  Following these developments  London Stock Exchange acquired a majority interest in   an MTF that offers pan European trading  Major competitors in Europe  other than LSE  include NYSE Euronext  Deutsche B rse AG  NASDAQ OMX  SIX Swiss Exchange and Bolsas y Mercados Espa oles as well as Turquoise  Some of these competitors have themselves launched MTFs U S  listed equity optionsThe market for the trading of U S  listed equity options is also intensely competitive  with nine authorized U S  options exchanges as of December 31  2011 vying for market share  and is in the midst of significant change  driven primarily by recent regulatory changes Primary competitors in the options market are the Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   NYSE Euronext  NYX   NASDAQ OMX  NDAQ   International Securities Exchange Holdings  Inc   and Boston Options Exchange Group  LLC  Moreover  some products offered uniquely by CBOE  for example  products based on the VIX volatility index  represent products that are not traded on the BATS platform  In addition  some competitors  including NYSE Euronext  NASDAQ OMX and CBOE  offer multiple trading venues for equity options that use different pricing strategies  which allow them to potentially appeal to a broader customer base BATS may face competition from strategic investors   BATS strategic investors or their affiliates may already have or may acquire an ownership interest in competing businesses  including national securities exchanges  dark pools  MTFs  ATSs or ECNs   These businesses may compete with BATS  either in relation to existing product and service offerings or any diversification of BATS product and service offerings into new asset classes and or new geographic locations  For example  certain of BATS strategic investors have a material interest in another MTF  Turquoise  Furthermore  many of BATS strategic investors operate market making desks  dark pools   lit  ATSs and ECNs and smart order routers  each of which potentially competes with BATS EMPLOYEES   170 as if December 31  2011SHAREHOLDERSInclude Citigroup Financial Products

10842,232357,NDAQ,Sell in May and Walk Away  Not This Year,opinion,One catchy investing maxim that s popular this time of year is  sell in May and go away   the notion that investors should cash in their investments and take the summer off  Historically  this hasn t been a bad strategy  You can see from this chart that June  July  August and September have been the worst four months of the year for the S P 500 Index since 1988  Since 2000  the June September period for the S P 500 is split  Half of the years saw positive returns  while the other half were negative  Historically  you have only about a fifty fifty chance for a positive gain during those months while your odds are roughly 10 percent better during the rest of the year  The trend is less consistent for emerging market stocks  You can see that the median monthly return for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index since 1988 is negative for June and August  but positive for July and September  The frequency of positive returns during the June September period is roughly 6 percent lower than the rest of the year ,2012-04-30,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sell-in-may-and-walk-away-not-this-year-121730,121730
10843,232358,NDAQ,Facebook Failure  The Carnage To Social Media Stocks Has Only Begun ,opinion,So the Facebook  FB  IPO is now complete  Zuckerberg has collected his billions  the underwriters took their  discounted  selling commission  investors have taken a bath  and the class action suits are already being filed    The transaction was a disappointment by any objective measure    Investors who received allocations ahead of the transaction had a very short window to liquidate shares at a profit  And if you ve ever played the IPO game before  you know that  flipping  shares on the first day is a great way to ensure you never see another IPO again  unless of course you re a multi billion dollar fund     Investors who didn t get shares on the deal   but still chose to buy in the aftermarket   are in even more hot water  Many of these buyers consider themselves  traders   but have quickly transitioned to  investors  as underwater positions are held in the hope of getting bailed out by a rebound    Even the underwriters got a bum deal  Since Facebook was the most widely anticipated IPO in years  it was considered a  privilege  to be part of the deal    The underwriters were willing to price the deal for a much lower concession than they would typically charge for a transaction   because being a part of the FB deal would put them in the good graces of their clients  and help them win future investment banking business    Morgan Stanley  MS  and the other underwriters have huge reputation risk after the most widely anticipated IPO of the decade broke below the deal price on the second day of trading   resulting in losses for their best clients    Speaking of reputation risk  NASDAQ OMX Group  NDAQ  is in major damage control mode after botching the opening and leaving traders unsure of whether they were filled on orders   and at what price  Think about it  the exchange had literally YEARS to prepare for this transaction  and yet they completely dropped the ball  Facebook is already reportedly discussing plans to move their listing to the NYSE  and it is unlikely that the NASDAQ will be awarded a major IPO for years to come    Joe Weisenthall makes an interesting argument that ALL investors were harmed by Facebook   whether they participated in the deal or not  The billions of dollars used to purchase new shares had to come from somewhere   with the net result being a twisted  program that sucked capital out of the market    Social media stocks were liquidated across the board as investors reacted to the disappointment  At this point  it looks like the entire group is breaking down  with a number of key stocks representing attractive short candidates    Over the next few weeks  the underwriters will undoubtedly try to prop up Facebook   in an attempt to control the damage  This buying pressure should set up some tremendous short opportunities as the group drifts and then continues to adjust to an environment that is focused on the true value of these names instead of the hype that has driven prices up to this point    The majority of social media stocks are priced with a significant amount of  growth premium  built into their shares  Whether profitable  or still in the  building stage   investors are paying up based on the expectation that these companies will continue to experience hockey stick growth    Unfortunately  potential growth is only part of the equation  Investors also have to price in the risk associated with the business models    Social media stocks are in an extremely competitive environment  Groupon Inc   GRPN  has to fend off a number of niche deal sites like Living Social which have low barriers to entry  and in many cases are more attractive to merchants    Pandora Media  P  is facing rising competition from Spotify  and even the mighty Facebook has LinkedIn Corp   LNKD  carving out a major piece of market share    With the bubble now officially bursting  this competition becomes much more of an issue  Retail investors aren t willing to buy these popular names at any price   just get me IN  has turned to  I want OUT      Mutual fund managers realize that they will have a hard time explaining major social media positions to investors  And value investors aren t going to be interested in supporting these stocks until they are trading at a mere fraction of current prices    Based on the way capital typically flows into and out of  cult  or hyped story stocks  the next few weeks could offer some of the best social media short setups we will see all year   and also may represent the last truly good reward to risk social media setups for a number of months    For the next few trading sessions  underwriters have an implicit duty to help prop up the share prices  so that institutional investors have a chance to minimize the damage  Propping up Facebook should also help other stocks in the group as retail investors decide not to panic since FB is  rebounding     A drift or mild rebound following breakdowns from last week gives us a chance to enter short positions using stop limit orders which are triggered when the stocks resume their downtrend  Our risk points can be relatively tight  because once the stocks make their bearish continuation moves  they should pick up momentum significantly    Below are three of our favorite social media short candidates that I will be watching for attractive entry points over the next several trading sessions LinkedIn Corp  LNKD    Nosebleed Valuation and Broken ChartLinkedIn is currently trading near  100 per share  with analysts expecting  0 67 in earnings for 2012  Bulls make the argument that compelling growth justifies the price  But even considering  1 22 expectations for 2013  the stock is still trading at a multiple of 82 Traders have aggressively liquidated the stock  driving prices sharply below the key 20 and 50 day EMAs on strong volume  A reliable trend line  in place since the beginning of the year  has now been broken  giving trend followers an excuse for bailing out Facebook continues to compete indirectly with LinkedIn  both for subscribers as well as for investment capital  In a competitive environment like this  profit margins are squeezed and premium equity prices are very likely to contract HomeAway Inc   AWAY   Price Failure and Priced to PerfectionHomeAway initially traded well above the  27 IPO price  but was unable to maintain the premium price as the hype wore off  Heavy resistance right at  27 provides a ceiling for the stock and a worst case scenario risk point for short positions The company s business faces low barriers to entry  and plenty of competition as firms like Google expand their business lines  and new Zuckerberg wannabes set up social networking sites Investors are paying 48 times 2012 expected earnings  and 36 times 2013 expectations   a hefty premium for a stock that is projected to see decelerating earnings growth and has already seen the quarter by quarter revenue growth decline Youku  Inc   YOKU   Adding Geopolitical Risk to Social Media ChallengesYouku  the  YouTube of China   faces all of the challenges that US social media stocks deal with  as well as the geopolitical risk of operating a social media site in China  The company has to comply with censorship regulations and treads a fine line between offering users a chance to express themselves  while still appeasing the government regulators Although the firm has been operating since 2007  YOKU has yet to turn a profit and is not expected to post positive gains until 2013  when analysts project 9c of earnings per share   The stock has already dropped from a 2011 peak of  65  but could have much farther to go based on a  reasonable  price to forward earnings metric Investors are reducing their exposure to both social media AND emerging market equities  two powerful trends that add pressure to this social media stock  The  24 to  25 range represents an important resistance level and a follow through on last week s breakdown could ignite massive selling Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice ,2012-05-28,Mercenary

131309,352824,NDAQ,Nasdaq proposes exclusive exchange trading for illiquid stocks,news,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK  Reuters    Nasdaq Inc  O NDAQ  asked regulators on Wednesday to allow issuers of thinly traded stocks listed on its exchange to trade almost exclusively on Nasdaq  as part of a broader plan to boost trading in small  and mid sized companies 
There are 13 U S  stock exchanges  with at least two more preparing to launch  and a company s shares can be traded on any of them  regardless of whether they are listed on the Intercontinental Exchange Inc s  N ICE  New York Stock Exchange  or Nasdaq 
The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission asked the exchanges in October to bring it proposals aimed at making thinly traded securities  which Nasdaq defined as trading less than 100 000 shares a day  on average  for six consecutive months  easier to trade 
Concentrating all the orders for a stock on a single exchange would help bring buyers and sellers together  while reducing market complexity and lowering trading costs  Nasdaq said in a filing with the SEC on Wednesday 
 Nasdaq proposes to establish a tier nestled within the U S  public equity markets that is better tailored and far more hospitable to thinly traded securities than is the all purpose  undifferentiated market environment in which they suffer today   the New York based company said 
Shares can also be traded on around 30 broker run off exchange trading venues  which would not be affected by Nasdaq s proposal 
Drawing from consultations with market participants  as well as its experience operating a venture exchange in the Nordics  Nasdaq said it would also seek regulatory relief to relax trading and disclosure rules for companies with thinly traded shares 
For instance  exempting thinly traded stocks from a rule that says trades must happen at the best displayed bid or offer in the market  would allow the exchange operator to use on demand auctions to further pool liquidity  And allowing issuers to pay market makers to maintain quotes on their stock could lead to more attractive spreads and more orderly openings and closings of the stock 
Cboe Global Markets  Z CBOE   which operates four U S  stock exchanges  but does not have a corporate listings program  said in a Dec  20 letter to the SEC that allowing companies to trade on a single exchange would dampen competition and innovation among exchanges 
Those who support the move  criticize the  one size fits all  market structure in place today   Cboe said 
 Their proposed fix is to limit trading to a single national securities exchange  offering a single market structure  The irony of this solution is not lost on Cboe  ",2020-02-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nasdaq-proposes-exclusive-exchange-trading-for-illiquid-stocks-2077039,2077039
