168888,390404,LEN,Lennar Ends Its Fiscal Year With a Surge in Deliveries of Homes,news,"Homebuilding titan Lennar  NYSE LEN  wrapped up its fiscal 2019 in a position to boast about a spate of healthy financial and operational metrics  The company s fourth quarter report  released Wednesday  didn t provoke a significant reaction from shareholders  however  as Lennar stock closed up a modest 0 80  on the trading session 
Below  we ll walk through the outcomes of the last three months  all comparative numbers are presented against those of the prior year quarter   
A bird s eye view of the quarter

Data source  Lennar 
Essential details from the report

Lennar s major revenue stream  homebuilding  rose by 7 8   Home deliveries surged by 16  to 16 420  
Demand remained vibrant as new home orders increased by 23  to roughly 13 100  The dollar volume of new home orders also increased by 23   to  5 2 billion 
Order backlog in units was flat at approximately 15 600 homes  but the dollar value of the company s unfilled order book dipped by 4  to  6 3 billion 
Revenue in the financial services segment inched up by less than 1  to  252 8 million  but operating earnings leaped by 30  to  74 8 million on a higher capture rate of mortgages tied to the company s home deliveries 
The multifamily segment increased revenue by 61  to  176 million  But due to the lack of sales of operating properties  operating earnings of  3 7 million represented just a fraction of the  33 million in earnings booked in the prior year quarter  In that quarter  Lennar generated most of its profits from gains related to the sale of two unconsolidated properties   
Gross margin on home sales advanced by 100 basis points to 20 6   while operating margin on home sales improved by 40 basis points  to 13 9  
In the prior year quarter  the company realized a gain of  0 58 per share on the sale of the Rialto investment and asset management platform  net of certain nonrecurring expenses  Adjusting for this item  current period earnings per share  EPS  of  2 13 improved nearly 16  against Q4 2018 EPS of  1 84 
Lennar ended the fiscal year with homebuilding debt of  7 8 billion  against  8 5 billion at the end of fiscal 2018 


Management s outlook
In Lennar s earnings release  management stated that the quarter s double digit increases in home deliveries and new orders exceeded its expectations  Management added that it continues to reduce the company s exposure to land in its effort to concentrate on home inventory  Lennar s supply of owned homesites decreased to an average of 4 1 years  against 4 4 years at the end of the previous sequential quarter 
Executive chairman Stuart Miller said   As we head into 2020  we expect our fiscal 2020 deliveries to be in the range of 54 000 55 000 homes  homebuilding gross margin percentage to be in the range of 20 5  21   and our cash flows to continue to accelerate as we continue to refine our overall land program  With only  600 million of senior notes due in 2020  we will opportunistically deploy excess cash flow to repurchase additional debt and return capital to shareholders  
An attractive valuation
In my recap of last quarter s earnings  I noted that shares of Lennar are bordering on value territory  today  the LEN symbol looks even more attractive  as it now trades at only 9 5 times forward earnings  This represents a substantial discount versus the S P 500 index s average mid cap forward price to earnings ratio of 17 0  Investors  fears of a cyclical slowdown in the housing construction market have recently kept a lid on shares of Lennar and those of its peers  But with each passing quarter  Lennar s improving earnings are creating a relative bargain for long term investors who can stomach a bit of volatility and risk ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfz1q,2056081

168895,390411,LEN,Lennar Debuts New Strategy as Part of Strong Earnings Report,news,"Lennar  NYSE LEN  recently reported strong fourth quarter earnings and the stock has risen 11  since the announcement a week ago  But something even more interesting came out of that report  and it hinted at a new strategy Lennar is developing to take advantage of the growing demand for single family rentals  The national homebuilder also explained how the measures it is taking will reduce the company s risk should a downturn in the real estate sector return 
Strong earnings and growth indicators
Growth indicators for Lennar in the final quarter of the fiscal year  such as deliveries and new orders  were up smartly at 16  and 23  respectively  While deliveries were up 16   revenue rose by only 8   which was a result of lower average sale prices  Average sales prices fell from  413 000 to  400 000 which was driven by a higher concentration of starter homes  which naturally carry a lower price tag 
Gross margins increased to 21 5   a jump of 10 basis points and an indication that the change in product mix to more starter homes is not negatively affecting profitability on each home   

Lennar continues with its  land light  transformation
Lennar continued with its plan to become more  land light   which is a reduction in its inventory of homesites  Owning land for a homebuilder has advantages and disadvantages  On one hand  a company will save money by buying earlier when prices are rising  On the other  it is a use of cash and it ties up capital that could be used for other purposes  such as other growth opportunities or stock buybacks 
Builders will often use option contracts  which give the right to buy land at a predetermined price for some set period of time  Companies will often refer to this as  controlling  a site  At the end of the contract  the builder can choose whether to buy the land at the agreed up price or walk away  By doing this  builders can lock in prices without paying up the full amount up front 
During the quarter  Lennar reduced its inventory of land from 4 4 years  worth to 4 1 years  worth and increased the percentage of controlled sites to 33   The company then deployed some of that cash to pay off debt and buy back stock 
A new  lean concept reduces risk for Lennar
Lennar introduced a new concept in its conference call  which addresses the single family rental market  With interest rates at historically low levels  single family rentals have been a popular asset class for professional investors searching for yield  Investors bought single family foreclosures in bulk during the financial crisis  rehabilitated the properties and then rented them out  The inventory of distressed single family homes is largely picked over at this point  so investors are now focusing on new developments  Lennar Chief Executive Officer Rick Beckwitt described the activity on the earnings call 

 Last quarter we daylighted our single family rental program  where our homebuilding operation will be building and selling homes in bulk in communities where the land is owned by third parties with no lease up risk to Lennar  

This means Lennar is building homes with much of the risk pushed onto other parties  Such a strategy is very much in line with Lennar s  land light  focus since the company is taking no risk on land pricing to begin with    it is someone else s property  Lennar also takes no risk on vacancies    again it is someone else s project  Lennar contracts to build the properties  sells them in bulk to the buyer  and then moves on  From a balance sheet perspective  this activity is highly efficient in that land and finished properties are not tying up capital  The new concept will not have a meaningful impact on earnings until 2022  however  management is excited about it and what it can do for future earnings 
Cheap valuation  with some tech upside
The entire homebuilding sector was on a tear in 2019  benefiting from the unforeseen drop in interest rates  The SPDR S P Homebuilder ETF rose 27  last year  while Lennar was up 30   The stock is trading at 9 4 times 2021 earnings  which is a cheap valuation for a company at this stage of the current housing cycle  Historically  home builders will trade at higher multiples when the cycle is near its bottom and very low multiples the closer it gets to the top  Lennar is trading with a low multiple in a home buying cycle that forecasts to run for years on pent up demand alone 
Lennar s P E multiple is single digit despite its position in the cycle  which is nowhere near historical peaks  Lennar s  land light  strategy will give the company more flexibility when the eventual housing downturn arrives  Lennar is trading with a cheap multiple yet has taken steps to mitigate the cyclical nature of the business and has a lot of higher growth irons in the fire  Investors who lack exposure to the housing sector should consider adding some since the fundamentals for homebuilders such as demand  demographics and interest rates are highly favorable right now  Lennar is a sector leader  with some possible tech upside ",2020-01-17,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pjcl4,2062068
168897,390413,LEN,Why Lennar Stock Jumped 18 9  in January,news,"What happened
Shares of Lennar  NYSE LEN  leapt nearly 19  last month  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  The U S  homebuilding titan delivered a strong fourth quarter earnings report and announced a monster increase to its dividend 
So what 
Lennar s revenue grew 8  year over year to  7 billion  The gains were fueled by a 23  increase in new home orders and a 16  rise in deliveries  
Better still  Lennar is becoming more profitable as it expands its revenue base  Its gross margin on home sales improved by 10 basis points  to 21 5   while its operating margin increased 40 basis points  to 13 9   This helped to drive an 11  rise in Lennar s adjusted net earnings to  674 3 million  or  2 13 per share  

Now what
Lennar s increasingly profitable homebuilding operations are also generating boatloads of cash  In fiscal 2019  Lennar produced  1 6 billion in homebuilding cash flow  which it used to pay down  1 1 billion in debt and repurchase nearly  500 million of its shares  
 Our fourth quarter showcased our company hitting on all cylinders as our operations continued to improve cash flows and returns   Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said in a press release  
This strong cash generation also allowed Lennar to boost its dividend by an enormous 213   to  0 50 per share  on Jan  9  
 We are increasing our dividend as part of our overall strategy of focusing on total shareholder returns   Miller said   Given our focus on operational excellence  land strategy and cash flow  we believe a diversified program of debt reduction  stock repurchase and now an increased dividend  is appropriate   
Investors apparently like what they see from the homebuilder  Lennar s stock is already up another 4  so far in February  in addition to its strong gains in January ",2020-02-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psu8m,2079906

forward looking statements OperatorI would like to introduce your host  Mr  Stuart Miller  Executive Chairman  Sir  you may begin Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanGreat  Good morning  everyone and thank you  This morning  I m here in MIAMI with Rick Beckwitt  our Chief Executive Officer  Jon Jaffe  our President  Diane Bessette  Chief Financial Officer  and Dave Collins  our Controller  and  of course  you just heard from Alex I m going to start as I always do with a brief overview  Jon and Rick are going to give some additional operational remarks  and Diane will deliver further detail on our fourth quarter and year end numbers as well as some guidance for our first quarter and our full year 2020  As always when we get to our Q A  we d like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible So let me go ahead and begin by saying that this is another excellent quarter and year end for the Company as we continue to focus on performance  cash flow and total shareholder returns  We re very pleased to report record quarterly performance together with a record strong finish to 2019 that started off paused and sluggish and ended the year with a rather robust housing market  Our results reflect both the continued strength in the housing market as well as our continued focus on leveraging size and scale to drive greater cash flow and higher returns on equity and on capital On the macro front  the housing market continued to strengthen throughout the fourth quarter  confirming the continuing    trend that we reported in our last two quarterly earnings calls  The market for new homes has continued with steady improvement from last year s pause  as lower interest rates have stimulated demand while the overall fundamentals of the economy have remained strong  We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter as a combination of lower interest rates and slower price appreciation have positively impacted affordability  Greater affordability together with low unemployment  wage growth  consumer confidence and economic growth drove home purchases  especially  at the entry level to return to a more affordable housing market Even with the constant noise from the current election cycle and from the ebb and flow of global tensions  which we re seeing play out in real time  the indicators that we see and hear from our customers reflect confidence in the stability of the economy and in the job market  As of now and through today  the housing market is strong On the Company front  Lennar achieved record results as we posted net earnings of over  674 million or  2 13 a share for the quarter and approximately  1 850 million or  5 74 per share for the year  These results derived primarily from solid operating results from both homebuilding and financial services as our ancillary businesses have become less of a factor  In homebuilding  improvement in new orders and deliveries produced a gross margin of 21 5  for the quarter  which was at the high end of our guidance last quarter  While deliveries jumped 16  over last year and new orders improved 23  over last year s rather tepid fourth quarter  our size and scale in most of the best markets in the country enabled us to offset rising land costs with production cost savings  while overhead leverage has driven our SG A to an all time fourth quarter low of 7 6  and the full year low of 8 3   which has enabled a net margin of 13 9  and 12 3   respectively  We re confident that these trends are going to continue into 2020 Our financial services performance also continued to contribute to our earnings beat  I want to focus on this segment for a minute as I did last quarter  Our financial services performance and improvement continues to be a proxy for many of the important initiatives driving our Company into next year and beyond  For the year  our financial services division earned  244 million versus  200 million last year  up 22   Performance improved though through the year and in the current quarter  Our financial services segment generated a record quarterly profit of  81 2 million compared to  57 6 million last year for a 41  improvement  This record profit comes after selling substantially all of the Company s retail operations in both mortgage and title in the first quarter earlier this year  These sales enabled our team to focus on the core home buying business and to implement technology initiatives that are streamlining the remaining business  This focus on the core business drove significant operational improvement in the second half of the year First  we increased the Company s combined mortgage capture rate from 78     to 78  from 74  by focusing on simplifying our customers  engagement and providing excellent customer service  Second  we reduced the cost to originate a loan by a 11  from  6 300 per loan last year to  6 000 per loan in the third quarter to  5 600 per loan this quarter  steady improvement  and this is down by one third from  8 400 per loan in 2017  These cost reductions were driven by management s focus on technology initiatives  which include our blend front end technology for loan application along with robotic processes that automate repetitive processes to reduce paper flow and streamline the closing process  These improvements all lead to not only lower cost to the Company  but to a friendlier and frictionless customer experience with the Company Finally  we have reduced total financial services head count by about 50  at the same time  Technology together with management focus has enabled efficiency  a better customer experience and a much better bottom line  In our financial Services division  our management team and the entire group have made technology initiatives a core mission and are showing leadership for the entire Company in that regard  Accordingly  we are gaining ever more confidence that we will continue to improve our entire end to end process to get to a one tap closing and create a customer satisfaction process that is simple  frictionless and has never been seen before And as we re building these improvements  we re also seeing the fruits of our focus and investment at the bottom line  These improvements specifically and these types of improvements generally are sustainable  and they will continue to drive bottom line improvement in our financial Services segment and across our entire Company in the future  Over the next two years  we expect to see some of the same technology based improvements affecting our core homebuilding operation specifically in areas of customer acquisition costs and even flow production and inventory management  Stay tuned Moving on  while our strong operating results drove the bottom line  we are simultaneously focused on any and all ways to improve total shareholder returns by reducing our asset base  Our fourth quarter results reflect our overall focus on land spend and inventory control that has enhanced our strong and improving cash flow picture as well  We ve maintained a relentless focus on our pivot to a land lighter strategy  From the timing of land purchases to the duration of each land assets that we buy to the percentage of option versus owned land we are and will continue migrating toward a significantly smaller land owned inventory driving our business and our cash flow forward  While we are also driving our asset base lower by continuing to focus on monetizing non core assets and business segments are most immediately impactful focus remains on our land spend and our inventory  With that said  strong operating results and our focus on asset base has increased cash flow for this year to  1 6 billion  and projected annual cash flow expectations for 2020 are continuing to head toward the  2 billion mark In the fourth quarter  we used excess cash to repay an additional  600 million of debt while we also repurchased another 1 7 million shares of stock at an average price of just under  59 a share  For the year  we retired  1 1 billion of senior debt while repurchasing almost 10 million shares of stock while we ended the year with  1 2 billion of cash and our revolver paid to zero  We improved our balance sheet with a debt to total cap ratio of approximately 33   which is a 410 basis point improvement over last year  As we look to 2020  we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and we ll use cash to pay down debt and to return capital to shareholders while improving our balance sheet as we continue to improve our total shareholder returns In conclusion  let me end    let me end where I began  We had another excellent quarter and year end  Our management team is laser focused on driving returns with excellent operational execution and careful land and inventory management  This focus is not just demonstrated by our words  but also by last year s results  While 2019 is in the book  2020 seems even brighter to us  We remain encouraged by both market conditions for the remainder of the year and Lennar s position in it  Our size and scale continues to facilitate the management of cost and the production in a land and labor constrained market In addition to carrying forward the successes of last year  we have the additional opportunities of our growing single family for rent initiative and our technology based improvements to the way our customers purchase a home and the way our customers live in a home  These strategies along with our quote  unquote sustainable Lennar sub theme will continue to drive operational innovation and excellence and enhance total shareholder returns With that  let me turn it over to the rest of the team  Rick Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Stuart  We had a strong quarter in each of our business segments  driven by a solid execution of our operating strategies  Homebuilding revenues for the fourth quarter totaled  6 5 billion  representing an 8  increase from 2018  This was driven by a 16  increase in deliveries to 16 420 homes  partially offset by a 7  decrease in average sales price  Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance as we carefully matched available inventory with strong buyer demand  The decline in average sales price was driven by our continued strategic focus on a very robust entry level market as our percentage of first time buyers increased year over year Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 21 5   which was the top side of our guidance  and up 110 basis points sequentially from the third quarter  This sequential improvement benefited from the direct cost savings that Jon will discuss  as well as a higher number of deliveries which allowed us to leverage our field expense Our SG A in the quarter was 7 6   This marks an all time fourth quarter low and highlights the power of our increased market scale and operating leverage  Homebuilding operating earnings totaled  893 million  up 11  from the prior year  We re proud of the fact that our homebuilding earnings are growing at a faster rate than revenues  once again demonstrating our operating leverage Net earnings for the quarter totaled  674 million  up 11  from 2018  excluding the gain on the sale of Rialto and non recurring expenses in the prior year  New orders for the quarter increased 23  to 13 089 homes  exceeding the high end of our guidance  From a dollar value perspective  new orders totaled  5 2 billion in the fourth quarter  which was up 23  from the prior year as well  New orders increased significantly in each of our operating    in our homebuilding segments with extremely strong performance from our Texas region and our West region where new orders were up 48  and 34   respectively  year over year  Our Texas segment is perfectly positioned and continues to benefit from our strategic focus on the strong entry level market During the fourth quarter  we saw increased demand  which benefited from favorable housing market fundamentals  low unemployment  higher wages competitive mortgage rates  low inventory levels and a much more confident homebuyer  all contributed to a 26  increase in our sales pace per community year over year  We ended the fourth quarter with a sales backlog of 15 577 homes with a dollar value of  6 3 billion  Phonetic   This backlog combined with our current housing inventory puts us in a great position to close between 54 000 and 55 000 homes in fiscal 2020 As Stuart said in fiscal 2019  we were laser focused on improving our returns on capital and generating increased cash flow  With this in mind  increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing our year supply of owned homesites were top priorities  At the beginning of the year  we set a two year goal of having 40  of our homesites controlled via options and similar arrangements  We made great progress on this front throughout the year as we ended the first quarter with a 24  mix  ended the third quarter at 30  and finished the year at 33   Based on our progress  our new two year goal is to have 50  of our land needs controlled versus owned by the end of fiscal 2021 During the fourth quarter  we also made significant progress on reducing our years owned supply of homesites from 4 4 years at the end of the third quarter to 4 1 years at the end of the fourth quarter  Based on this progress  we believe we can reduce our years owned supply of homesites to three years by the end of fiscal 2021 as well  If we re successful  this would reduce our on balance sheet land position by approximately  3 billion  The combined impact of properly executing on our land lighter business and reaching our stated owned and controlled goals will drive meaningful higher cash flow  returns on capital and total shareholder returns Consistent with our land light strategy and focus on increased returns  we re continuing to develop a program to develop and address the single family rental market  There is no question that there is a shortage of affordable and workforce housing  and new single family rentals can solve this problem  Given the shortage  there is intense investor interest in professionally managed new single family rental communities  where the owner can leverage the overhead cost of managing the rentals because they are in the same community with identical features from home to home  Last quarter we daylighted our single family rental program  where our homebuilding operation will be building and selling homes in bulk in communities where the land is owned by third parties with no lease up risk to Lennar  Since then we ve expanded this program to include building and selling incremental single family rentals in bulk in separate sections of some of our larger existing communities  While we re at the beginning stages of growing this business  we are excited about its growth prospects  Given the lead time in developing new communities and getting home production started  single family rentals will only represent about a 1  of our closings in 2020  However  this program will have a much more meaningful impact in 2021 and we will provide an update accordingly  Single family rental is an expansion of our core business as it allows us to leverage our existing machine and overhead  Additionally  this program provides an interesting and unique hedge to our for sale business Before I turn it over to John  I would like to thank our associates and our trade partners for an excellent year  Through your hard work and collaboration we accomplished many great things in 2019  and more importantly  we re excellently positioned to execute on our strategies in 2020 I d like to turn it over to John now Jon Jaffe    PresidentThanks  Rick  As we look back on the quarter and our fiscal year we can clearly see the benefits we are receiving from our significant size and scale across the platform  For both the fourth quarter and for the year  we delivered the most homes in Lennar s history  We continue to see the benefits in our direct construction costs and in our SG A that is not only a result of the size and scale but also of our focus on process  particularly the simplification of processes to maximize efficiencies Turning first to direct construction cost  I noted last quarter we had visibility that our direct costs are going down sequentially and will contribute positively to our gross margins going forward  In our fourth quarter  70 basis points of our 110 basis points of sequential margin improvement came from our direct construction costs  In the fourth quarter  our direct costs as a percentage of our average sales prices was 45 5   Throughout 2019  this cost of price ratio has trended downward each quarter  We expect this trend to continue throughout 2020 even though we are projecting lower sales prices in 2020 due to a higher mix of entry level homes Looking at cost per square foot  year over year our direct costs were up less than 1  while our average square footage was down by 4   This is an improvement from the third quarter s 3  year over year increase and marks the lowest rate of year over year direct cost increase in 12 quarters  Going forward  as we deliver more entry level homes and our average selling price and square footage will both continue to be lower  While this is occurring  the ability to both lower our direct construction cost as a percentage of average sales price and to keep our cost per square foot relatively flat demonstrate the value of the size  scale and efficiency of our platform Across the country  our builder of choice focus allows Lennar to minimize the impacts of the labor shortage while maximizing supply chain efficiencies  Throughout 2019  we were disciplined with our even flow production model  which combined with our Everything s Included platform gives predictability to our trade partners  suppliers and manufacturers Turning now to overhead  as noted  our fourth quarter and full year SG A of 7 6  and 8 3  respectively were both all time Company lows  Our focus on simplicity and technology combined with our size and scale continue to give us SG A leverage  As we improve our systems and simplify our processes  our associates increasingly become more efficient  In the fourth quarter  our year over year personnel spend in homebuilding SG A was down 1   while our volume increased by 16  giving us significant G A leverage  We achieved sales and marketing leverage through the use of technology to reduce our sales and marketing spend As we mentioned last quarter  we are focused on higher quality internet leads to our internet sales team  In the fourth quarter  we had over 90 000 internet leads  meaning we had that many customers requesting specific information about a home or community  Our team of internet sales consultants may communicate with the customer online via text messaging or by phone call to learn more about the customers  needs and then match their specific needs with our homes  and arrange their visits to one of our communities  The result is high quality very well informed customers will set times visiting our communities In summary  we are executing our game plan with the following unified playbooks  One  simplification  maximizing the efficiency of every process  Two  asset light  optioning land and buying land with shorter durations  Three  even flow production  operating our Everything s Included platform with a step production start pace  while matching sales for this pace using our dynamic pricing model  Four  lower direct construction costs  developing strategic Builder of Choice partnerships throughout the supply chain along with value engineering workshops division by division  And five  technology  providing better systems and information for happier more productive associates  a better customer experience and lower costs Now  I ll turn it over to Diane Diane Bessette    Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerThank you  Jon  and good morning to everyone  So first  let me start with reemphasizing a few points from our fourth quarter  and I m starting with homebuilding  So as we ve mentioned  deliveries increased 16  from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of our guidance by 3  as we benefited from a strong housing market and a continued focus on returns  Our fourth quarter gross margin was 21 5   which was at the higher end of our guidance and the prior year s gross margin was 22 1  excluding CalAtlantic s purchase accounting Our fourth quarter SG A was 7 6   which is the lowest quarter SG A percent we have ever achieved and was below our guidance  This compared to 7 9  in the prior year  New orders increased 23  from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of our guidance by 6   Absorption for the fourth quarter was 3 4 versus 2 7 in the prior year as we benefited from increased demand and focused on accelerating the close out of slower paced communities to enhance returns  Our ending community count was 1 283  And finally for homebuilding joint ventures  land sales and other categories  we had a combined loss of  2 million compared to  4 million of earnings in the prior year And then turning to financial services  As Stuart mentioned  operating earnings were  81 million compared to  58 million in the prior year  And here s the detail of the components  Mortgage operating earnings increased to  57 million from  44 million in the prior year  Mortgage earnings improved due to an increase in captive volume as a result of higher homebuilding deliveries and a higher capture rate and reduction in loan origination costs primarily driven by technology initiatives  which enabled us to reduce headcount as Stuart mentioned Title operating earnings were  22 million net of non controlling interests  compared to  18 million in the prior year  The increase was due to an increase in captive volume and our focus on cost reductions to right size the business  Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were  3 million compared to a loss of  1 million in the prior year  This was driven by an increase in securitization dollar volume  partially offset by a decrease in securitization margins And then turning to multifamily  Multifamily segment had operating earnings of  5 million net of non controlling interests  compared to  33 million in the prior year  There were no building sales this quarter as compared to three transactions in the prior year And finally  other  This is a category of the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments  Earnings were  11 million this quarter compared to losses of  49 million in the prior year  This quarter earnings were largely driven by earnings related to our Rialto fund investments  while prior year losses were primarily due to non recurring expenses And then turning to our balance sheet  We ended the year with an extremely well positioned balance sheet  In fiscal 2019  we generated approximately  1 6 billion of homebuilding cash flow and ended the year with  1 2 billion of cash on the balance sheet  We continued to make progress with our strategy to reduce years of land owned and increase our land control position  At the end of the year  our homesites owned and controlled totaled 313 000  of which 209 000 were owned and 104 000 were controlled  As Rick mentioned  our years of land supply owned decreased to 4 1 at the end of Q4 from 4 4 at the end of Q3  Our controlled homesites increased to 33  at the end of Q4 from 30  at the end of Q3 At the end of the year  we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility  thereby providing  2 5 billion of available capacity  During the quarter  we retired  600 million senior notes that were due in November  This brings our senior note repayments to  1 1 billion for the year and  2 2 billion since the acquisition of CalAtlantic  During the quarter  we repurchased 1 7 million shares for a total of approximately  98 million  This brings our total for the year to 9 8 million shares  totaling  493 million  At the end of the year  our debt to total cap was 32 8   a 410 basis point improvement from the end of 2018 So now turning to guidance  I d like to provide some high level guidance for fiscal 2020  And then  I will provide more detailed guidance for the first quarter  So for the full year of 2020  we expect to deliver between 54 000 and 55 000 homes with an average sales price for the year of approximately 385 000  This average sales price reflects our focus on a higher percentage of entry level product  Our fiscal 2020 gross margin is expected to remain consistent with fiscal 2019 and will be in the range of 20 5  to 21   Although entry level margins tend to be slightly lower  we believe our margins for the year will benefit from our continued focus on reducing construction spend  leveraging field expenses over more deliveries and reduced interest expense as we ve continued to pay down our senior note maturities Our fiscal 2020 SG A should be in the range of 8 2  to 8 3   And as we continue to add higher volume  higher absorption entry level communities  while also accelerating the close out of slower paced communities to enhance returns  we expect our community count to grow 1  to 2  by the end of the year  Financial Services earnings should be in the range of  250 million to  255 million  And we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23 25   primarily due to the recent extension by Congress of energy efficient home credits Now let me give you more detailed guidance for Q1 only  Starting with homebuilding  We expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 11 300 to 11 500 and our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 9 800 homes to 10 000 homes  Our Q1 average sales price should be between  390 000 and  395 000  We expect our Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 19 7  to 19 8  noting that this will be our lowest margin quarter for the year and margins will increase throughout the year to be in the range previously stated  We expect our Q1 SG A to be in the range of 9 4  to 9 5   And for the combined homebuilding joint venture  land sale and other categories  we expect a Q1 loss of approximately  10 million We believe our financial services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of  25 million to  27 million  Our multifamily operations will be at about breakeven  And for the other category related to the legacy Rialto assets and our strategic investments  we expect Q1 earnings of approximately  8 to  10 million  We expect our Q1 corporate G A to be about 2  of total revenues  And as previously stated  we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23 25   The weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 313 million shares  And so when you roll all this together  this guidance should produce an EPS range of  0 80 to  0 85 for the quarter So in summary  we believe we are well positioned to continue to have strong profitability and increasing cash flow generation in 2020  And now  let me turn it over to the operator for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now begin the question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo  Your line is open Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystHi  Good morning  everybody  and nice quarter  Thanks for taking my questions  First  just wanted to start off  kind of  a multi part question on entry level  Multiple industry participants are moving to the entry level  Do you all seen upcoming supply imbalance or are you seeing robust enough demand that s really allowing the entry level communities to generate greater than historical absorption paces  And on the prior call  you all suggested that maybe you could get a 44  entry level in 2020  Do you think there is possibly upside to that level  given the demand that you ve been seeing  And finally  could you just give an update on kind of the gross margin profile versus your other segments  I mean  how much of a drag it might be on your margin profile Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanTruman  let me start just at a macro level and say  it s important for everyone to remember that the entry level part of the market has remained impaired for the longest period of time since the downturn and really had a very difficult time getting started  So that part of the market is probably the most supply constrain  When you note that a number of participants are migrating toward that market  it has most recent    more recently become accessible  demand is very strong in that part of the market  And I think it s going to be some time before it gets saturated Rick or Jon  may be you d like to talk about margin Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerYes  so from an overall mix standpoint and our position  I think we really have benefited from the fact that this has been something that we strategically target for the last several years  We ve been very methodical on lining up communities  repositioning product  working with our developer partners to really secure excellent positions that are sizable  When you re dealing with a single family or entry level product  you need some larger communities because you re absorption pace in these communities is much faster  So we re really well positioned From a mix standpoint  do we get up to 44   I think it s too soon to tell  We re probably in the low 40  right now  And we re just going to see how the years evolve  From a margin standpoint  as Diane said  the margins tend to be slightly lower than our first time move up    and move up product  But they come with higher velocity  and as a result the IRR associated with the build out of those communities is much  much higher  and that s why we focused on that Jon  anything else Jon Jaffe    PresidentYou covered it Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  Your rotation toward optional lots is    your traction has been a little bit faster than what we ve expected the past couple of quarters  Could you just discuss the health of the option land market whether these lots are becoming more available across the industry or whether this is purely the result of your land developer partners  And kind of part two of that question  could you just give an update on the strategy to expand your developer partner relationships  I believe you were at three previously  What you re kind of thinking throughout 2020 Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerSo  I think  what this really reflects is  as a management team  when we    when Stuart  Jon and I sit down and we make a plan  we execute on the plan  And we really decided that we were going to convert an increasing amount of our option position  We worked with our regional trade partners and our regional developers and have significantly expanded that program  We haven t necessarily entered into new arrangements with different developers  Rather  what we ve done is expand the footprint of those relationships to other markets  and that s what you re seeing in the increase  In addition to that  our teams out there are really leveraging the relationships they have in all of their markets to increase that percentage Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Thanks  guys Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman   Associates  Your line is open Alan Ratner    Zelman   Associates    AnalystHey  guys  Good morning  Congrats on the very strong performance  So I was hoping to drill in a little bit just in terms of your thinking right now on the capital allocation  You mentioned the focus on return several times  And this year was a huge year for cash flow as you were expecting  So great to see that come to fruition  If I look at how you ve spent your cash this year  debt on the balance sheet came down by about 800 million buybacks or about  500 million Phonetic   I know a lot of builders say the first and main use of cash is for growing the business  But it certainly seems like you re in a pretty enviable position where you can do that and throw off a lot of cash flow  So should we think about the    generally  the use of cash this year toward debt reduction and buyback as kind of how you re thinking about prioritizing that or has that shifted at all  given the fact that your debt to cap is now down to that 30  type level Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanSo  As we noted in our comments  we expect to continue to pay down debt  certainly  as it comes due  I think we noted that over the next year  over 2020  we have about  600 million of longer term debt coming due  You can expect that we ll pay that down net of cash flow  But additionally  returns to shareholders    focus on returning of capital to shareholders is something that will be continued and properly balanced  As we ve looked at our business and looked at our growth expectations  normal operations today are cash flow positive  As we noted last year  we produced  1 6 billion Phonetic   and we expect to continue that trend in more  And that excess capital is going to be balanced exactly as noted  We re very focused on our balance sheet  very focused on total shareholder return Alan Ratner    Zelman   Associates    AnalystThank you for that  Stuart  And second question  if I could on the SFR  the expansion there  First off  I guess  just more housekeeping  Were there any orders this quarter that flowed through the order line network geared toward SFR  And I guess  more high level  as you start to build these homes in existing communities  can you talk a little bit about the product that you re building for rental  Is it comparable to your for sale product  And if so  is there any concern about cannibalizing that piece of the business or is it being priced differently that it shouldn t compete Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerSo let me just start off by saying is that  right now  this business is very small in the grand scheme of things  And what we ve really done is focus on positioning to grow something that substantive  So from an order perspective for the last quarter  the orders associated with this word de minimis  What we ve really been focusing on is identifying markets that we can build to pay a good business that is focused on providing product that the market needs  Within our existing communities  what we ve really done is looked at sectioning off different phases or sections of the community that will be priced completely differently than our other for sale product  So smaller footprint  lower specification levels  not a lot of change from home to home pretty identical features right down the street Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanLet me back up for a second and say this  SFR has been a part of the sales program for the past years at both in our Company and in others  It s basically been on a one off basis  It s more mom and pop oriented  What we have been innovating over the past years and we daylighted this in Reno  It s a continuation of that  It s a more structured program  and we ve been focusing on looking at single family for rent communities  which is where we have innovated and all kind of branding going forward a new way of thinking about single family for rent We are at the early stages of this  It has been an evolutionary track for the Company  You re going to see others follow too  Capital is starting to understand this business  And this will be an emerging story as we go forward  But the single family for rent that we re talking about is single family communities for rent  which will be    there ll be a circle around that community  While there will be similarities with other single family product  it won t be directly competitive but instead this product is going to enable a consumer that want single family but might not quite be able to get into a for sale program  We re very enthusiastic about this and it s a unique Lennar branded program Jon Jaffe    PresidentI ll just had two points  One is  we don t think it will cannibalize our existing product at all  It is the same product  It s really filling the need  As Stuart just mentioned of a consumer that can t afford to buy  it doesn t make sense for them to buy  The other point is  the focus on this for us will further enhance our Builder of Choice position with the trade  as we have more volume  And this is even more consistent and higher volume  So we see that as being very complementary to our construction platform Alan Ratner    Zelman   Associates    AnalystGreat  Thanks a lot guys  Good luck Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan  Your line is open Michael Rehaut    JP Morgan    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone  and congrats on the results  My first question I had is focusing just on some of your comments around inventory and driving returns and the resulting cash flow  I don t know if I heard  and maybe you typically don t give  but I was just trying to get a sense when you talked about having inventory  your balance of inventory down  3 billion over the next two years  I was wondering if you could give us what that number is at the end of this year just to get a sense of where that number could go  And with that amount of inventory balance reduction  should we be expecting potentially an acceleration of share repurchase with the use of that as that cash frees up  I mean  obviously  we have a 1 2 billion Phonetic  of debt due next year  but given your still declining debt to cap  I would assume you d want some debt on the balance sheet and you can kind of push that maturity out  So just trying to get a sense again of the finer numbers around that that inventory reduction and how we should think about the use of that cash Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerSo let me start off by just generally telling you how we look at the dollar value difference  We ve told you that what we want to do is take our own supply from 4 1 years to three years by 2021  And if you step back and you look at it  you can calculate that two different ways  We    it s about one year of land purchase  So we buy about  3 billion of land a year  So  3 billion sort of sums up to that number  Looking at in a different way  based on our guidance of 54 000 to 55 000 homes for next year  if we don t have to buy the homesites associated with that  our average lot finished homesite or undeveloped  in some cases finished homesite  is about 54 000  55 000  which gets you to the same  3 billion number Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanAnd so    look  it s a pretty straight math calculation to look at the  3 billion number  Mike  you re correct and highlighting that this is additive to cash flow as we migrate in this direction  We do expect that cash flow will continue to benefit from our inventory and land strategy  And I think that your question is  does that mean that we accelerate things like debt and shareholder    return of capital to shareholders  And the answer to that is decidedly  yes Michael Rehaut    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  Thank you  I guess  the second question  just a little bit finer tuning granularity around order growth and how to think about that for the upcoming year  Obviously  you gave first quarter guidance and as well as community count growth expected to be 1  to 2  I believe for the year  I assume that s year end over year end  If you could clarify that  But how should we think about the sales pace component of that given that you ve kind of mentioned that you continue to expect to shift a little bit more toward entry level  which is higher sales pace versus other segments other buyer segments as well as the fact that you d expect the broader market to continue to improve a little bit given where we are with rates and affordability  etc  So just trying to kind of break out the pieces of that  I think expectations perhaps or in a low to mid single digit type of range for sales pace growth  but any thoughts around how you re thinking about that for the first quarter and the full year would be very helpful Jon Jaffe    PresidentHey  Mike  it s Jon  First of all that is correct  It s year end to year end comparison  As we think about pace  it really goes back to my commentary about very disciplined production approach in matching sales pace to that  So to the extent that the market is stronger or not we ll adjust pricing accordingly  So we expect our pace to be a consistent one  And to the extent the market is stronger  we would hope that we ll see improvement in margins over what we re projecting  To the extent that the market were to soften  we expect the pace to be consistent and we would see some reflection of that in our margins Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerAnd I d say additionally that  as part of our land and inventory management program  looking internally  we have clearly focused on more of our higher paced communities and focusing on those communities with greater absorptions  and we ve clearly and decidedly been pruning some of the slower paced communities that might have come from the CalAtlantic legacy that are more of a drag on some of our returns  So this is all part of our inventory management program  and we ve been looking community by community to enhance that the absorption rate therefore enhancing returns Michael Rehaut    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  So just to be clear then  given that shift that you re describing  Stuart  it wouldn t be unreasonable to expect an order growth rate for the year that would exceed the community count growth that you re looking for Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think that s definitely  Indecipherable  I mean  if you just look at the guidance we gave with regard to deliveries  the delivery growth is higher than the increase in communities  So you ll get a natural increase in overall sales that are greater than the 1  to 2  growth in community count Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanAnd that s a more efficient and more effective business model Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerThat s right  We ve strategically focused on getting higher velocity at of each community as opposed to growing communities at a higher rate Michael Rehaut    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  and thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG  Your line is open Carl Reichardt    BTIG    AnalystThanks  Happy New Year  everybody Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanGood morning  Carl Carl Reichardt    BTIG    AnalystAnd Jon  I wanted to ask a little bit about subcontractor trade cost  and obviously  starts were flat this year  We  builders  reporting some really significant order growth and move to the entry level  which increases number of units started    for two reasons  One is the velocity and also just business is better  How are you thinking about the trades  You didn t seem like they had a lot of overcapacity or    and not enough work last year  Are they going to look even with your scale and trying to get more aggressive on their pricing to you  And how do you come back  Is it just scale  is it just product simplicity and a focus on Everything s Included and even flow  I m just curious what your perspective is maybe not just this year  but also maybe for a year or two Jon Jaffe    PresidentSure  As you look backward  And as you look forward  there is a severe shortage of labor in the industry  particularly  skilled labor  And we really don t see that improving because a lot of the labor out there is actually aging out from the workforce  So we expect that pressure to continue  And as we started several years ago  we really thought about the fact that as volume grows there ll be more pressure on the system  and that s why we really reinvented ourselves with this focus of being the Builder of Choice  So it s     it s much more than just volume and scale  that is a big part that strategically positions us to be most desirable  But it has everything to do with this even flow production and the predictability that gives trade Our Everything s Included platform is really critical  because one of the big obstacles for trade is  if they go out to a job site and is not ready for them  that inefficient use of a labor that s already in short supply backed up on itself and creates real issues  And because of that  the trades find us more favorable to work for  because the jobs run smoother  they are more predictable  they don t have the starts and stops of options and upgrades  And so we are continuing to focus on how do we get even better at that    even more disciplined about even flow so that as we move forward  The trades are actually able to make more money on our business  because it s efficient not because we re paying them more Carl Reichardt    BTIG    AnalystThat makes sense  And then Stuart or Rick  just on pricing  again the mix shift to the entry level more price sensitive customer  We ve seen builders in the past use price to control pace so that production can actually catch up  but you re running even flow in your mix is changing  How do you look at your pricing power as you head into this year with such robust demand  but what s likely to be a more price sensitive consumer  And obviously  using dynamic pricing  I m sure  is helping manage pace  But again  is this different than what we ve seen in the past where builders were shoving price to try to hold pace off Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanI don t think it s different  It s    for us  it s going to be    as we ve said  to be on a very consistent pace  And if the market is stronger  and it currently is showing signs of now historically  Phonetic   it s strong  and we see that across our markets that we will have pricing power greater than we had in the last year or two  That will unfold as the months go by  and we ll see exactly what the market is like  But as we look at it right now  it s strong  and we would expect to be able to benefit from that Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerYes  And I think the thing to focus on  we will solve the price  whether that s a higher price or lower price  But we re very focused on net operating margin for each community Thanks  Rick  Thanks all OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI  Your line is open Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    AnalystYes  thanks very much  guys  Good quarter  Thanks for the information regarding your outlook for the year and the quarter  I had a little question about the interplay of the margins and the order cadence you suggested in 1Q  And I guess  in general  my question is  your margin assumption for the quarter versus the year since you said that you expected the first quarter to be the low in the year and you gave a pretty healthy guide for the full year  can you give us a sense for when in the year you re expecting to see that fairly meaningful step up in the margin  Is that going to be like kind of 2Q  3Q event or is that something that you re sort of envisioning will happen later in the year  And if it is like as soon as the second quarter  is that a reflection of the current environment  allowing you to get better price then the order comment you made of up 8  would suggest Jon Jaffe    PresidentYes  Steve  it s Jon  As an overview  remember that our first quarter is always our lowest from a volume perspective  and therefore our field is spread out  It has a bigger impact on the margins in the first quarter  and you always see that trend with us  So we see sequentially throughout the year margins will improve as we get greater field leverage just purely based on volume  The improvement is throughout the year though based on what we expect to see with this more efficient of both gross margin  net operating margin out of the efficiencies we re gaining in our systems and our costs and our SG A that should flow through all of our numbers  So for the combination  those two things progressing throughout the year Diane Bessette    Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYes  Stephen  maybe the only thing I d add is  I think  if you look at the growth of gross margin in 2019 that would give you a really good proxy for what we re expecting in 2020 with the back half of the year having the highest increase in margins Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    AnalystGot it  All right  That s helpful  Secondly  I was really intrigued by this comment  Stuart  you made about how you saw the improvement in the financial services business  and I guess  specifically  you cited the mortgage origination business and some of the tech initiatives that you ve got going on there  And I believe you used the word proxy for what we might see from many of your other tech initiatives across the    across the Company  And I was curious if you could give us a little bit of a preview as to what you meant by that  I think you had said homebuilding customer acquisition costs and even flow and construction management as I think about some of the initiatives you ve got    obviously  you have the high buyer  Phonetic  investment and Open Door  which could lead to customer acquisition cost  Could    but I m particularly intrigued but this even flow and construction management how    in what way could the improvement we saw in your mortgage origination business be a proxy for that Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanSo thank you for listening to the call carefully  Steve  Yes  that s exactly what I said  And it starts with the fact that  in our financial services group  which is where we really initiated many of our technology initiatives  We had a management team start to dip a toe  then a foot  then a leg into technology stream  And as they became more entrenched  there was kind of a feedback loop that began that said   Wow  this really does have import  This really can have impact   And the more we did  the more we explored  the more we found  we could change the way that our business operates  If you think about the migration from  I think it was  8 600   8 700 per loan in 2017 toward a  6 000 or  5 600 per loan cost of origination  That s a sizable step over a fairly short period of time  And it comes from management focus and integration of new technologies  new ways of doing business that hadn t been done or tried before  And the feedback that comes from early successes feeding the adventure of drilling deeper and trying more We re starting to see many of those things happen in and around our dynamic pricing program  We ve talked about it before  Early adoption starts to bring some early successes  It takes some time for those earlier successes to start accelerate    start to accelerate and start to translate into real cost reductions  but we re starting to see real efficiencies in the way that our inventory turns  If we look back from this year s year end back to last year s year end  the efficiency with which we are driving closings through the year  it s having real bottom line impact in the way that our business is configured  and we think that that will accelerate  As it relates to customer acquisition  we ve talked about a number of our initiatives  Open Door being one of them  But others of them are more internally focused about customer acquisition and then lead scoring developing into a driven focused internet sales consultant approach to the way that we handle our customers  We think that  as it starts to drive    as we start to drive adoption  we ll drive cost down and efficiencies up So there are a lot of initiatives going on behind the scenes  If you d ask me this question at the beginning of the innovation cycle and financial services  it would have been hard to demonstrate the specific areas where cost would come from  But it s management focus  early successes and adoption and that cycle that drives the cost structure down  And I think that the financial Services group in that regard is a proxy for the way that we re seeing things starting to happen on the homebuilding side as well  Does that help Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    AnalystYes  and that s very interesting  I guess  just a one little clarification on my part would be the numbers you gave around the mortgage cap    mortgage origination costs declining  I assume you re implying from that you re improvement that you traced out for us has been better than what you believe the industry overall has been  So that s not just an industry issue  that s Lennar issue  And similarly  you expect that in these other avenues as well  Is that correct Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanListen  I can t really look at what the rest of the industry is doing at a micro level  but from what we understand at a macro level  the cost within the industry has been migrating higher and we are an outlier in that regard Stephen Kim    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  Thanks very much Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanYou re welcome  How about one more question OperatorThank you  Our next question will come from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Charles Brown    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  This is actually Charles Brown filling in for Susan  Thanks for taking my question  and congratulation on strong results Jon Jaffe    PresidentThank you Charles Brown    Goldman Sachs    AnalystI was just wondering if you can provide an update on some of your key markets  such as Florida and Texas and California  and also specifically for Texas  if you think your success in this region is reflective of your recent initiative in this market Rick Beckwitt    Chief Executive OfficerSo let s start with Texas  I can tell you that we had strong performance in each one of our Texas markets  San Antonio  Austin  Dallas and Houston  all up high double digits  The region was up 48  year over year in orders  and it really is driven by the fact that we ve completely repositioned to a much higher percentage of entry level product  Right now  we re about 50  of our sales and communities are below  250 000 price point and about 70  of our communities are below  300 000  So it s the strength of that reposition that s really fueling the market there  With regard to Florida  Florida  Phonetic  are very strong  particularly on the lower price points in that first time move up  And that really is across the board about the north than east to west Jon  do you want to talk about California Jon Jaffe    PresidentYes  California is clearly seen a recovery  If you look at it from a year over year perspective  in the prior year California is really fallen off and the pause affected California perhaps more than any other parts of the country  What we saw in the fourth quarter was much a healthier market  a clear recovery back to normal sales paces  even in the Bay Area  which was perhaps the most impaired by a market slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018  We ve seen that market come back to life  I wouldn t describe that as robust yet  but certainly a lot healthier Charles Brown    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thank you for your time guys Stuart Miller    Executive ChairmanAll right  very good  Well  thank you everybody for joining us on our call  We look forward to reporting in 2020  As you can hear  we re pretty enthusiastic about the year to come and look forward to keeping you updated  Phonetic   Thank you all for joining Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  66

168979,390495,LEN,Fifth Wall raises  503 million from property owners seeking tech edge,news,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK  Reuters    Fifth Wall  a venture capital firm focused on real estate technology  raised  503 million from a group of 50 large U S   European and Asian property owners who will provide a market for the start ups and their products it invests in 
Venice  California based Fifth Wall said on Wednesday its real estate venture capital fund is the largest  proptech  investment pool raised to date and its investor base is the largest consortium of property owners ever assembled 
Property owners have been slow to adopt technologies that use predictive analytics and sensors  for example  to slash energy consumption or increase efficiency  Fifth Wall  founded in 2017  is seeking to fill a void as functions such as data collection are increasingly being computerized 
Fifth Wall invests in companies that will benefit its group of property owners  which include Gecina SA in France  Spain s Merlin Properties and  British Land  Co Plc  LON BLND  in Europe  and Mitsubishi Estate in Japan  said Brendan Wallace  a managing partner at the VC fund 
Fifth Wall targeted the largest homebuilders  brokerages  office and retail building owners in Europe  Asia and the United States  he said 
The consortium s size increases access  insight  collaboration and the sharing of ideas among the investors and portfolio companies  Wallace said  calling it a network effect 
Fifth Wall noticed the nine investors in its first proptech fund sought not only a financial return but also synergies and cost savings with the technologies they adopted  he said 
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis real estate owners have recognized their business no longer is buying and selling assets  but being a better operator  Wallace said 
Stuart Miller  executive chairman at  Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN   told analysts in June that the use of Fifth Wall portfolio companies Opendoor  a direct home buyer  title insurer States Title  and digital mortgage platform Blend has cut expenses and increased operating margins 
 What we ve been seeing is 10 basis points here  20 basis points there over the last quarter  year   Miller said  according to transcripts of the call   Technology has made us better at what we re doing  
The money Fifth Wall raised more than doubled the size of its first fund  which closed in May 2017 at  212 million  With a third  retail oriented fund  Fifth Wall now oversees more than  1 billion  the company said

168981,390497,LEN,Toll Brothers shares sink as California demand dwindles amid trade war,news," Reuters    Shares of  Toll Brothers   N TOL  fell more than 6  on Wednesday after the U S  luxury homebuilder reported a 36  collapse in orders in California  where other sector players have signaled waning demand from affluent Chinese buyers in light of President Donald Trump s trade war 
In June  the No 2 U S  homebuilder  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  flagged weakness in the region and warned that more tariffs on Chinese imports could increase raw material costs and dent margin 
As the trade war continues to stoke fears of a recession  analysts say they expect California deceleration to hurt Toll s full year 2020 top line and margins given the nine to 12 months delivery cycle on orders 
 The revenue mix from California  for Toll  will likely decline through fiscal 2020  This is the biggest impediment for the stock  in our view   said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Dahl 
Toll s customers include high net worth individuals who are more sensitive to stock market volatility compared to builders such as D R  Horton  N DHI  which targets first time buyers

168982,390498,LEN,Chinese U S  homebuying to hit eight year low  says leading property site,news,"By Dominic Roshan KL and Ankit Ajmera
 Reuters    U S  home sales to Chinese buyers are likely to drop to an eight year low in the year ending next March as a prolonged Sino U S  trade war hits demand  according to estimates from Chinese real estate website Juwai com 
Analogous to U S  portals like Realtor com and Trulia  Juwai is China s largest international property website  hosting some 2 8 million listings on both sides of China s internet censorship mechanism known as the Great Firewall 
Based on its enquiry and buyer data  as well as feedback from industry partners  the site estimated U S  home sales to Chinese buyers would fall to between  10 billion and  12 billion in the year to March 2020 
While that represents just a fraction of 1  of the  1 6 trillion worth of U S  homes sold annually  it is down from the  13 4 billion reported for the year ended in March by the National Association of Realtors  NAR  and from more than  30 billion in both 2017 and 2018 
The site s executive chairman  Malaysian based German tech entrepreneur Georg Chmiel  said worries over U S  visas  the weakening yuan  and the desire to diversify investments had spurred a collapse in sales to Chinese buyers after a five year surge 
 The Trump administration s tariffs  aggressive rhetoric  targeting of Chinese graduate students at U S  universities  and new visa red tape have all hurt Chinese demand   he told Reuters

After a decade of gains against the dollar  China s yuan currency  has fallen 11  in the past 18 months  capped by a devaluation in August which was widely seen as a political move in the trade war and which added to buyers  concerns 
Chmiel said for Chinese customers U S  properties served as both financial investments and potential homes for them or for offspring  who they hoped one day would study and work in the United States 
 With the trade war going on  it s easy to imagine a scenario in which you might be forced to sell or your investment might otherwise lose value   he said

CALIFORNIA FADING
The trend has shown up at U S  housebuilders this year  with luxury homebuilder  Toll Brothers  Inc  N TOL  flagging sluggish sales in California  which makes up as much as 30  of its business and is the main target market for Chinese buyers 
The country s number two builder   Lennar  Corp  N LEN  also recently put the blame for soft sales in the state and a western region which accounts for 42  of sales  on fading Chinese demand 
Gay Cororaton  a senior economist at the NAR  did not provide detailed forecasts  but said a slowing Chinese economy and the dollar s strength were likely to keep pushing down Chinese buying  particularly in prime markets such as California 
 Chinese buyers form a significant portion of international home sales in California  where home prices have been increasing steadily  and that has been one of the factors acting as a deterrent for home purchases  when the yuan has declined   she said 
 They might look for properties in areas that are less expensive than California  such as Texas and Seattle  And this could put downward pressure on prices in California   Cororaton said 
Dean Jones  principal and owner at Seattle based brokerage Realogics Sotheby s International Realty  said the focus was shifting to  secondary gateway markets  such as Seattle  because of their strong economies and relative affordability 
Jones said Seattle was wooing international buyers with properties selling for a third or half the price of real estate in San Francisco or Los Angeles 
One 41 year old businessman from Tianjin in China  who is looking for properties with a U S  broker and asked not to be named  told Reuters he hoped the trade war would be resolved soon and that he was considering waiting it out before buying 
 The United States is a livable country where the natural environment  climate  education  medical care  commodity prices are all satisfying   he said

169003,390519,LEN,Buyers Catch a Break as Mortgage Rates Fall Most Since 2008,news," Bloomberg     U S  mortgage rates fell by the most in more than a decade  giving homebuyers a crack at the lowest loan costs since early 2018  The slowing housing market could use the boost 
The average rate for a 30 year loan was 4 06 percent  down from 4 28 percent last week  Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday  The decline was the biggest since December 2008  The average 15 year rate dropped to 3 57 percent from 3 71 percent 
The housing market  damaged by a spike in mortgage rates last year that cut into affordability  is signaling that it s getting some strength back  Two publicly traded builders   Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN   and KB Home  credited lower rates for better than expected home orders  And mortgage applications for purchases rose 4 percent last week from a year earlier  according to the Mortgage Bankers Association 
Prices in many areas are so high that buyers are stretched thin  so even a small change in rates can have a big impact on purchase decisions  said Glenn Kelman  chief executive officer of brokerage Redfin Corp 
While strong job growth will help  buyers may have less confidence in the economy after a recent drop off in stocks and headwinds gathering from Europe and China  The Federal Reserve cut its outlook for growth this year and next and forecast no interest rate hikes for 2019 
Don t expect lower mortgage rates to spark a surge in demand  but something more like a  stabilization   said Robert Dietz  chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders

169004,390520,LEN,Two Geysers of Pent Up Wealth Are About to Erupt,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Everything is coming together this year for households to shake off their post recession fears of financial engineering  The question is whether they will once again embrace debt and leverage 
One catalyst for a wave of spending and borrowing is the potential of a record year for initial public offerings as large numbers of private tech companies like  Lyft   NASDAQ LYFT  and Uber finally hit the public markets  Companies are looking to go public not just because the timing is right in the evolution of their companies  or just because market conditions are favorable  but also because to some extent because there s a herd effect once a few noteworthy companies start to go public 
Employees of these companies will finally be able to unlock the wealth they have that s been tied up in private tech companies for years  Between the actual IPOs and the expiration of lockup periods months down the road  this will mean tens of billions of dollars of buying power for insiders of those companies  A lot of that will be leveraged as tech workers use their IPO gains as down payments to buy houses with huge mortgages  Significant chunks will go into wealth management and other financial services products  The effect may be concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area  where many of these companies are located  but there will be second order effects   like retirees selling their homes to tech workers and moving to cheaper pastures   as well as some employees cashing out and moving to other metros where housing is more affordable 
The second catalyst is the continued plunge in interest rates  The 10 year Treasury rate is now down to levels it hasn t seen since 2017  and mortgage rates are dropping below 4 percent  This is the perfect environment for the housing market as we enter the heart of the spring buying season  and in their earnings reports this week homebuilders KB Homes and  Lennar   NYSE LEN  both said they were optimistic about the impact lower rates would have on the market  More Americans might be willing and able to take out a mortgage  considering that the unemployment rate is lower and wage growth is a fair amount higher than it was when interest rates were at similar levels in 2017 
Those two catalysts could drive up home values  That would have much larger ripples if homeowners revert to an  old normal   being opportunistic about home equity and interest rates to treat their homes as vehicles for financial engineering 
The balance sheets of homeowners in the aggregate have improved significantly since the depths of the housing bust  Home equity percentage levels are at 16 year highs  While in the early years of the housing recovery  the improvement was mostly in coastal  particularly West Coast  markets  over the past couple years home price appreciation has been most rapid in some of the hardest hit  bubble markets   For instance  Las Vegas currently has the fastest home price growth of any market tracked by the Case Shiller Index  and since the end of 2016 home prices in the Las Vegas market are up 22 percent  A lot of homeowners who may have been underwater or only had a little bit of home equity when interest rates were at current levels in 2017 now have a significant amount of equity they can tap 
If we really are at the end of a cycle of interest rate increases  whether it be for economic or political reasons  it makes a lot of sense for homeowners with equity to start thinking about refinancing or taking cash out of their homes  Sound familiar  It certainly could lead to a return to bubble era behaviors  with reckless mortgage fraud or using cash out refinancings to buy boats  But for a lot of households doing a cash out refi makes a lot of sense  Like with many things  a behavior in moderation can be prudent while excess is what gets you into trouble 
Maybe households have some high cost credit card debt or need to replace a family car  and by tapping home equity they re able to restructure their debt or free up cash to buy a car  Depending upon what their current mortgage rate is and how long they ve been paying their mortgage  they might be able to refinance into a new 30 year mortgage with the same monthly payment as they currently have  The further we get from the financial crisis and as memories of that era fade  the more homeowners will be receptive to these types of scenarios 
Even as a large part of the economic story this decade has been a rise in private tech company valuations and a recovery in home prices  we generally haven t seen either store of wealth tapped by households  In 2019  we finally may  That could be what allows U S  economic growth to continue ",2019-03-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/two-geysers-of-pentup-wealth-are-about-to-erupt-1822048,1822048
169005,390521,LEN,U S  consumer confidence dives  trade tensions hurting economy,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer confidence tumbled to a 21 month low in June as households grew a bit more pessimistic about business and labor market conditions amid concerns about a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China  The economy s prospects were further dimmed by other data on Tuesday showing sales of new single family homes unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in May  Growing risks to the economy  especially related to the trade war between Washington and Beijing  and low inflation prompted the Federal Reserve last week to signal interest rate cuts beginning as early as July    The headwinds from the ongoing trade war the economy faces are definitely growing stronger  and it will be a miracle if Fed officials can pull a rabbit out of their hats and keep the economy moving forward   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York  The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped 9 8 points to a reading of 121 5 this month  the lowest since September 2017  from a downwardly revised 131 3 in May  This month s drop in the index was the largest since July 2015  The index  which was previously reported at 134 1 in May  still remains at lofty levels  suggesting consumer spending remains supported   The Conference Board blamed the decline on the trade tensions and cautioned that continued uncertainty  at some point  could even begin to diminish consumers  confidence in the expansion   The economy will mark 10 years of growth next month  the longest expansion on record  President Donald Trump last month imposed additional tariffs of up to 25  on  200 billion of Chinese goods  prompting retaliation by Beijing  Trump has threatened more duties on Chinese imports if no deal is reached at a Group of 20 nations summit this week in Japan  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer confidence index at 131 1 in June  The Conference Board survey showed a decrease in the share of consumers with a favorable assessment of business conditions this month  The survey s so called labor market differential  derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful  fell to a one year low of 27 6  in June from 33 5  in May   That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department s employment report    The rolling over that we are seeing here in jobs plentiful is worryingly reminiscent of what we have seen late in prior cycles   said Tim Quinlan  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina   If past patterns hold  without a turnaround in this series  job growth could slow in coming months   The economy created 75 000 jobs in May  a sharp step down from 224 00 in April  Last month s tepid job gains were largely viewed as an anomaly  given that a key labor market indicator  weekly claims for unemployment benefits  remains low  Job growth has averaged 164 000 per month this year compared to 223 000 in 2018  The pace of job gains  however  remains well above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population  The unemployment rate is hovering near a 50 year low of 3 6   The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury prices were mixed  Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower  WEAK HOME SALES Gross domestic product growth estimates for the second quarter are ranging from a 1 5  to 2 4  annualized rate  The economy grew at a 3 1  rate in the first quarter   Slowing growth was underscored by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday

reported 673 000 units  Economists had forecast new home sales  which account for about 10 5  of housing market sales  rising 1 9  to a pace of 680 000 units in May  New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month to month basis  Sales fell 3 7  from a year ago  The housing market has remained sluggish even as mortgage rates have dropped  with builders continuing to complain about land and labor shortages  Tariffs on Chinese imports are also worrying homebuilders    Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN   the No 2 U S  homebuilder  said on Tuesday the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods resulted in a headwind of about  500 per home on average during its second quarter  which ended on May 31   Overall  housing data have been mixed  Reports last week showed single family

inflation has been slowing after last year s surge in mortgage rates dampened demand for housing   A slowing economy will constrain housing demand  and that implies house price growth will continue to

169079,390595,LEN,Trade Idea  A Tale of the S P 500 Tailwind,news,"For the start of the new week  only a decline in ES that breaks below 2490 95 support will be a significant warning signal that the recovery rally is over prior to reaching my optimal next upside target of 2580 2600  writes Mike Paulenoff of MPTrader com 
On the morning of Wednesday December 26  the first trading day after the Christmas Day holiday  the ES  e mini March S P 500   plunged to a new three month corrective low at 2316 75  a full 21 4  beneath its September 21 high  In the hours thereafter  ES reversed strongly to the upside  from an acute oversold condition  and with a bit of prompting from the POTUS 
In my closing commentary in our member room at MPTrader com  I wrote   Today  the besieged bulls finally got some payback after weeks of downside  and days of relentless late session selling pressure  After an iffy start to the session  today turned out to be just the opposite of the prior 4 days  exhibiting a bullish intraday profile and strength during the last 20 minutes of trading  Indeed  the last few minutes of trading morphed from prior day s long liquidation events into FOMO    Fear of Missing Out    on a powerful upside reversal day that should have momentum tailwinds to the upside    
 Technically  there should be enormous near term tailwinds generated by today s key upside reversal that point to a challenge of the upper channel boundary at 2540  into the 2560 70 overshoot target zone before this rally is exhausted  
See chart that accompanied my commentary 
In the aftermath of the Christmas Upside Reversal  last week ES  e Mini March S P  traversed a range from 2438 50 to 2539 25  or 100 75 S P points  4 1    and all of it occurred on Friday after Jay Powell acquiesced to the wounded easy money masses  appearing to become a kindler  gentler and more investor sensitive Fed Chairman  
The Powell Thrust propelled ES up through the aforementioned upper channel boundary at 2540  confirming my expectations for momentum tailwinds in the aftermath of the powerful December 26 Bullish Engulfing Candle  aka Key Upside Reversal Day   
Did the Powell Pop expend the remaining upside momentum from December 26  And if not  where might ES go from here  In that Friday s 100 S P point up day also represented a Bullish Engulfing Candle  aka Key Upside Reversal Day     the second in the past 7 sessions    I am expecting follow through strength that has as its next target zone 2580 2600  as noted on our latest chart 
See latest chart 
Reuters  Wall Street takes a breather Monday after Friday s rally 
Let s notice that each of the major upside reversals  Dec  26 and Jan  4  coincided with a very supportive statement from a heavyweight political figure or Federal Reserve official 
On the first occasion  paraphrasing   President Trump told the press that he thought the  20   stock market sell off was a great buying opportunity 
On the second occasion  Fed Chair Powell told investors what they wanted to hear that the Fed would become much more sensitive to and dependent on data from both the real economy and the stock market  At this time  real economic data and stock prices are telling the Fed to exert more patience before continuing to raise rates again in 2019 
 
Whether President Trump is proven to be a lucky market timer like President Obama was in March 2009 remains to be seen  What is proven  however  is that without an accompanying very accommodative Federal Reserve policy to support and motivate investors  presidential prognostications about a bullish turn in the equity markets are destined for the trash heap   
Since late in the Fall  a tightening Fed presided over a 20  market correction amounting to 630 25 ES  S P futures  points  while the combination of a POTUS Buy recommendation and Fed Chair Jay Powell s communications designed to ease frazzled nerves  without easing rates  has scored a recovery of 222 50 points  or just 35  of the entire Sept  Dec  decline 
Meanwhile  Quantitative Tightening  Fed reducing its   trillion balance sheet by  50 billion per month  expiring mortgage backed securities and Treasury bonds  remains on  auto pilot  until Jay Powell and Company decide it should be modified or curtailed  The Fed reduced its balance sheet by  420 billion during 2018 and is expecting to reduce it by another  600 billion during 2019  The Fed remains in tightening posture  regardless of Powell s pronouncements this past Friday 
With the next FOMC policy meeting  statement  and press conference scheduled for January 29th and 30th  we are unlikely to hear from Fed Chair Jay Powell again for at least three weeks  but we will definitely hear from President Trump  probably more frequently this coming year than in the past  if that is possible   owning to the proximity of the 2020 election  
If bullish equity index price action continues to coincide with or depend on extraneous positive POTUS and or Fed headlines  then for this week  potentially positive  or negative  market catalysts will have to emanate from progress in the US China trade talks  or not   and resolution of the government shutdown  or not  
Although a new earnings season begins this week  possible directional catalysts will have to wait until Wednesday for results from Bed Bath   Beyond  BBBY   KB Home  KBH  and  Lennar   NYSE LEN  
Right now  my technical set up and momentum work on ES point still higher  into the 2580 2600 target zone where I will be expecting the recovery rally off of the Dec  25 low at 2316 75 to exhibit both pattern completion and upside momentum exhaustion 
In the absence of some sort of bullish catalyst that triggers additional nearer term upside progress that propels ES towards 2650 60  my work continues to warn me to treat strength as a fleeting  though powerful  counter trend rally within the dominant downtrend established after the September high  
For the start of the new week  only a decline in ES that breaks below 2490 95 support will be a significant warning signal that the recovery rally is over prior to reaching my optimal next upside target of 2580 2600  and that the dominant bear trend already is reasserting itself  ES closed at 2529 50

169099,390615,LEN,Why Main Street Should Worry About Wall Street s Bond Selloff,news," Bloomberg Opinion     The recent leg lower in the bond market has pushed mortgage rates to the highest since the start of the decade  The glass half full people might say that s not a problem since rates are less than half the levels seen during the bad old days of the 1980s when borrowing costs exceeded 10 percent  But that s not the way to think about the potential fallout from higher rates  The real issue is what current mortgage rates represent to the current generation of home buyers  And by that measure  the outlook is rather dire 
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association  the average loan rate for a conforming 30 year mortgage was 5 10 percent in the week ended Oct  12  the highest since early 2011  Back then  that level didn t hold for long  as rates crashed to 3 5 percent by late 2012 and held at those low levels for years  As recently as July 2016  the 30 year rate was at 3 6 percent  Starting points matter  especially now with home prices at nosebleed levels  According to Black Knight s August Mortgage Monitor  the monthly payment on the average home has jumped by 16 percent since the start of the year  That s up from a 3 percent increase in 2017  illustrating the effect of rising rates on affordability 
The potential for rising rates to inflict damage on household finances has grown in the era of extraordinarily easy monetary policy  Yes  mortgage lending standards were tightened after the housing bubble burst in the financial crisis  but record low rates have nevertheless allowed buyers to afford pricier homes and homeowners to refinance to improve their cash flow via lower payments in order to augment stagnant income growth  But that was then  Refinancing activity is off by a third compared with last year  an effective drag on households 
Twice a month  the University of Michigan reports its Consumer Sentiment Index  In the preliminary October report  reported buying conditions for autos and homes fell  The last time both of these gauges were as low as they are today was the early 1980s as the economy was emerging from a grueling recession  If history is any guide  a sustained level of higher rates is the second nail in the coffin for housing followed by an upward turn in the unemployment rate and recession  We re well on our way to the second stage 
Determined homebuyers are increasingly turning to adjustable rate mortgages  or ARMs  which have low initial rates that adjust either higher or lower after some period depending on prevailing rates at the time  Currently  the average 5 year ARM charges a rate of 4 34 percent  As per the Mortgage Bankers Association  ARMs comprised 7 1 percent of new applications in the latest week  the most in a year 
To be clear  demand for ARMs is a shadow of what it was during the last boom when underqualified buyers did whatever it took to get into overpriced homes and lenders were happy to accommodate  At the apex of the housing bubble  ARMs were over half of mortgage activity  The drivers of ARM usage  however  have not changed  It s still all about price  The average ARM today is  661 000  which are clearly being used to finance high end homes  And just like when the last housing bubble burst  the risk is that ARMs taken out in recent years will reset at higher rates  leading to defaults and weighing on housing prices 
And don t forget that well heeled home buyers are also likely to have a high concentration of stock market holdings  And given that eight of the top 10 markets with the largest monthly declines in home prices in July as measured by Black Knight were on the tech heavy West coast  a month when technology stocks were headed to record highs  it s not hard to imagine how fast home prices will fall once the air comes out of the tech bubble 
Black Knight highlighted San Jose in its latest report  The average home price in San Jose fell 1 4 percent in July  a sharper decline than any other market and the steepest drop for any month in any of the top 100 markets since the housing recovery began  Prices are down by 2 percent since May following a cumulative rise of 35 percent over the prior 20 months  Black Knight notes that  71 of the largest markets nationwide have seen the rate of home price appreciation slow in recent months  
How bad things get may depend on supply  The housing market has been marked by low inventories placing ever greater upward pressure on home prices  There are two root causes  The first is that both small and institutional investors have scooped excess supply to flip or rent homes  And the second is the millions of owners who were able to hold onto their homes by modifying their mortgages through a government program through 2016  But after five years  their 2 percent interest only payment period ends  At that point their loans will fully amortize and the mortgage rate will rise by one percentage point per year for five years  The payment shock will be enormous and could lead to an exorbitant number of homes being dumped on the market 
Two announcements in recent weeks suggest lenders have grown wise to the building risks  Home builder  Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN   put Rialto Capital  its real estate lending group  up for sale  And  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   said it will rein in the expansion of Marcus  its direct lending to consumers arm 
The outlook for households  and by extension the economy  is on shaky ground  Many households simply cannot weather a rising rate environment ",2018-10-18,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-main-street-should-worry-about-wall-streets-bond-selloff-1650251,1650251

1  European Political Tensions Ease as Italy Plans to Cut Budget Deficit
Market jitters eased on Wednesday and the euro rebounded  amid reports that Italy s populist government plans to cut its budget deficit after next year 
Italian newspapers reported that the government will reduce its budget deficit targets for 2020 and 2021 to 2 2  and 2  respectively and stick with its plan for 2 4  for 2019 
The government originally stated it would run a deficit of 2 4  for three years  which would have breached European Union fiscal rules 
Italy has the biggest nominal debt in the EU and its promise of increasing the deficit sparked fears of a renewed financial crisis and caused a steep increase in 10 year Italian bond yields earlier this week 
2  ADP  ISM data on Tap  IMF Economic Forecasts Expected
Investors will be paying close attention to private sector employment numbers ahead of Friday s government nonfarm payrolls report 
The ADP private sector payrolls numbers come out at 8 15 AM ET  12 15 GMT   On average  economists expect that September payrolls rose to 187 000 from 163 000 the month before 
At 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT   the ISM will release its measure of September services activity  The ISM non manufacturing PMI is expected to have ticked down to 58 1 last month from 58 5 in August 
The International Monetary Fund will also update its global economic outlook at 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT   IMF chief Christine Lagarde hinted in a speech on Monday that the organization could cut its growth forecast due to trade protections and high levels of debt 
 In July  we projected 3 9  global growth for 2018 and 2019  The outlook has since become less bright  as you will see from our updated forecast next week   she said

4  Oil Prices Firm as EIA Inventory Data Awaited
Oil prices remained supported near 4 year highs amid expectations for tighter markets from next month as the U S  prepares to re impose sanctions on Iran 
London traded Brent crude futures were up 0 21  to  84 98 a barrel from their last close  within striking distance of the high of  82 55 reached Monday  the most since November 2014 
U S  crude prices were steady at  75 33  hovering near Tuesday s 4 year peaks of  75 91 
The prospect of a looming supply crunch has prompted a rally in oil prices  and analysts fear that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non OPEC members  including Russia  have little spare capacity to boost output in order to offset falling supply 
Iran is OPEC s third largest producer 
While global markets are tightening increased domestic output means that U S  supply remains plentiful 
In its weekly report on Tuesday the API said crude stockpiles rose by 907 000 barrels last week  slightly lower than the 1 5 million barrel rise some energy analysts were predicting 
Official inventory data will be released by the U S  Energy Information Administration at 10 30 AM ET  with analysts expecting a build of 1 98 million barrels

SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Online real estate company Opendoor said on Wednesday it has raised  325 million in new financing  the latest so called mega round in venture capital as investors eagerly deploy their record size funds 
The new funding puts San Francisco based Opendoor s valuation at more than  2 billion  according to a source familiar with the matter  The round was led by investors General Atlantic and Access Technology Ventures  as well as home construction company  Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN   Investors Andreessen Horowitz  NEA and Norwest Venture Partners  among others  joined the round 
Opendoor bids on homes  buys them and then sells them  charging a fee of about 6 7 percent to 13 percent  The company says it eliminates steps such as finding a real estate agent and hosting open houses  and homeowners are not stuck waiting to sell their house before they can move or forced to juggle two house payments 
Founded in 2014  Opendoor has yet to be tested by a housing market crash 
The company is on pace to spend more than  2 5 billion on home purchases over the next year  with the average price of a home at  250 000  The company declined to provide its revenue from selling homes 
More startups like Opendoor are raising mega rounds  the term for funding rounds of  100 million or more  as venture capital firms raise larger funds and write larger checks to compete with investors like SoftBank Group Corp  which has a war chest of billions of dollars  In the first quarter this year  U S  based startups raised 34 mega rounds  almost double the number raised in the same time period a year ago  according to data firm CB Insights 
Opendoor investor NEA last year raised its largest fund ever   3 3 billion  and Norwest Venture Partners this year closed a  1 5 billion fund  its largest to date 
The round brings Opendoor s total fundraising to  645 million  and the company has also raised about  1 5 billion in debt  It plans to expand to 50 markets from the 10 markets it operates in today ",2018-06-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/real-estate-startup-opendoors-valuation-tops-2-billion-after-funding-1491134,1491134

169163,390679,LEN,U S  homebuilding soars in January  import prices jump,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  homebuilding rose to more than a one year high in January  boosted by strong increases in the construction of both single  and multi family housing units  and further gains are likely with building permits surging to their highest level since 2007  Other data on Friday showed a jump in import prices last month amid solid increases in the costs of petroleum and a range of other goods  bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year  The bullish housing data suggested the economy remained on firmer footing at the start of the year despite weak retail sales and industrial production in January    The economy is back on a winning path for stronger growth even if it is not firing on all cylinders with all sectors participating   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   Housing starts jumped 9 7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 326 million units  the Commerce Department said  That was the highest level since October 2016 and followed an upwardly revised sales pace of 1 209 million units   Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1 234 million units last month after a previously reported rate of 1 192 million units  Building permits surged 7 4 percent to a rate of 1 396 million units in January  the highest level since June 2007   A tightening labor market is boosting demand for housing  but rising mortgage rates and house prices could slow the momentum  Despite the unemployment rate being at a 17 year low of 4 1 percent  annual wage growth has not exceeded 3 percent   In contrast  the annual house price increase topped 6 percent in November  The 30 year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4 38 percent this week  the highest level since April 2014  from 4 32 percent in the prior week  according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac  Mortgage rates are rising in tandem with U S  government bond yields on worries about rising inflation   INFLATION PUSHING HIGHER The inflation concerns were underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing import prices jumping 1 0 percent in January after gaining 0 2 percent in December  In the 12 months through January  import prices rose 3 6 percent  the largest advance since April 2017  quickening from a 3 2 percent increase in the 12 months through December  While prices of imports from China were unchanged for a second straight month  they increased on a year on year basis for the first time since October 2014   Going forward  we expect higher import prices to feed through to firming producer and consumer prices domestically   said Gregory Daco  chief U S  economist at Oxford Economics in New York    Data this week showed an acceleration in consumer and producer prices in January  which boosted expectations inflation will rise this year and potentially breach the Federal Reserve s 2 percent target  Inflation is expected to be driven by a tightening labor market  a weak dollar and fiscal stimulus in the form of a  1 5 trillion U S  tax cut package and increased government spending   Higher inflation could prompt the Fed to be a bit more aggressive in raising interest rates this year than is currently anticipated  The U S  central bank has forecast three rate increases for this year  with the first hike expected in March  A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers  inflation expectations unchanged in early February   The PHLX housing index  HGX  was trading 0 6 percent higher on Friday  in line with a broadly firmer U S  stock market  Shares of D R  Horton  N DHI   the nation s largest homebuilder

higher as investors bought back bonds after a selloff earlier in the week  Single family homebuilding  which accounts for the largest share of the housing market  increased 3 7 percent to a rate of 877 000 units in January  Single family home construction rose in the South and Northeast  but fell in the Midwest and West  Permits to build single family homes fell 1 7 percent in January  but the drop could be temporary  A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders hovering at lofty levels in February  Builders expected an increase in sales over the next six months  Single family home completions increased 2 2 percent to 850 000 units last month  the highest level since June 2008  While that rise will help to alleviate an acute shortage of houses on the market  single family completions are half of what they were during the housing market boom in 2006   Builders have ramped up construction of single family homes and completions should rise going into the spring selling season   said Mark Vitner  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina  
Starts for the volatile multi family housing segment surged 23 7 percent to a rate of 449 000 units in January  Groundbreaking on multi family housing projects with five units or more rose to its highest level since December 2016  Permits for the construction of multi family homes soared 26 5 percent ",2018-02-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-import-prices-increase-more-than-expected-in-january-1260069,1260069

At January s sales pace it would take 6 1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market  the most since July 2014 and up from 5 5 months in December  The median price for a new home increased 2 5 percent in January to  323 000 from a year ago ",2018-02-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-new-home-sales-drop-for-second-straight-month-1311887,1311887

Corporation  NYSE LEN   LEN   NVR  Inc   NVR   D R  Horton  Inc   DHI   PulteGroup  Inc   PHM  and Toll Brothers  Inc   TOL  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The U S  housing industry has been reaping benefits from the U S  Federal Reserve s dovish monetary stance  Lower mortgage rates have been spurring demand in this rate sensitive housing market  This  along with a stable economy  rising disposable income and favorable demographic changes are continuing to support demand  Raw material prices   which have been increasing over the past few months due to the initial effects of tariffs on items like steel  aluminum and softwood lumber   are now decreasing  This should provide a meaningful boost to margins in the near term  According to an Associated Builders and Contractors  analysis of information provided by the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  construction material prices dropped 2 2  on a yearly basis in October 2019  However  despite the fact that declining mortgage rates and lower housing prices have been driving traffic after a tough second half of 2018  the conversion of that traffic into signing of purchase contracts slowed down in the high end housing market  Softness in home purchases in this particular segment  in response to affordability challenges and general market uncertainty  are impacting the order flow of luxury homebuilders like Toll Brothers  Again  shortage of skilled labor is a pressing concern  Homebuilders continue to be cautiously optimistic about the industry s prospects owing to rising land and labor costs  Again  rising incentives to drive sales are eating into margins Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry is an 18 stock group within

to 1 The industry s position in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since June 2019  the industry s earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020 have gone up approximately 5 7  and 7 1   respectively Given the solid near term prospects  we will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market  But before that  it s worth taking a

169277,390793,LEN,On Gatsby s North Shore  Chinese luxury home buyers pause,news,"By Koh Gui Qing and Elias Glenn JERICHO  N Y  BEIJING  Reuters    Among the sprawling colonial homes and well tended lawns on the north shore of New York s Long Island  there are signs that Chinese policies crafted 11 000 kilometers away are taking a toll  In the past year  there has been a slowdown in the stream of affluent Chinese looking for luxury homes in the area   widely thought to have been the setting for F  Scott Fitzgerald s 1925 novel  The Great Gatsby    property brokers said   Over the past eight months  the Chinese authorities have introduced a series of measures to make it more difficult for Chinese to move capital out of the country as they seek to keep the Chinese currency  the yuan  from falling  At the end of last year  for example  disclosure rules were tightened to try to prevent individuals from using any of the maximum  50 000 they are allowed to buy in foreign currency in any one year to purchase overseas property and other overseas investments  Those who violate the rules can face stiff fines  Any slowdown in flows from China can have a big impact in real estate around the globe  In the U S  alone  Chinese buyers  including people from Taiwan and Hong Kong  bought  27 3 billion in residential property in the year to March 2016  more than three times the next biggest foreign buyers  the Canadians  according to the National Association of Realtors  After three decades of blistering economic growth  China has created a class of nouveau riche  many of whom want to move their families abroad  attracted by places with cleaner air and fewer food safety issues than back home  as well as the prospects of a Western education for their children  This has inflated home prices around the world  as thousands of Chinese buy property in favored cities such as Sydney  Los Angeles  New York  and Vancouver  Now  though  the increased controls on currency outflows are having an impact in some markets  In the past couple of months  Chinese developer  Country Garden   HK 2007  has inside China stopped marketing apartments in its massive Forest City project in Iskandar  southern Malaysia  and disclosed that some home buyers want to cancel purchases because of the capital controls  Still  the party hasn t ended in some other markets  In Sydney  Australia  home prices have risen at a blistering 16 percent in the past year  thanks in part to Chinese demand  On and close to Long Island s so called  Gold Coast  the drop off in interest is apparent to some in the industry   The money suddenly dried up last year   said Lois Kirschenbaum  a broker specializing in luxury homes on Long Island s north shore  an area favored by Chinese partly because of its reputation for having good schools   We used to get vans of Chinese buyers each month one or two years ago during the buying season in Spring  We haven t seen any vans this year   she said  Kirschenbaum  who estimates half of her buyers are Chinese  said prices of homes in the neighborhood costing more than  2 million have fallen about 10 percent in the past year  In the first quarter of this year  the average price for home sales on Nassau County s North Shore   which includes the Gold Coast and nearby towns   was  984 357  down 9 7 percent from the previous quarter and 2 percent lower than the first quarter in 2016  according to a report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate  The number of sales was down 14 8 percent from the fourth quarter but up 5 6 percent from a year earlier  FEWER AT OPEN HOUSES At a recent open house for a  3 25 million five bedroom home in Brookville that has a bar  a heated pool  a sports court and a license to rear a horse in the backyard  only two interested parties showed up for the viewing  and both were Chinese  A year ago  an open house would have attracted a lot more Chinese buyers  brokers said  But the flow of Chinese money is far from turned off  Chinese buyers have been expanding their interest to cheaper properties in markets in Asia  Eastern Europe and Latin America as interest in overseas real estate remains healthy but concerns about the capital controls push some buyers towards properties at lower price points  buyers and people in the industry say  That was reflected at China s largest overseas property fair  the Beijing International Property Investment and Immigration Expo  in mid April  where sales agents marketed homes from over 30 countries to thousands of prospective Chinese investors in the nation s capital   Thailand is hot right now because of the capital controls   said David Wei  an organizer for the expo   Homes in Thailand range from 300 000 yuan  about  43 000  to 1 million yuan  That is relatively cheap   Enquiries about Thailand properties on Juwai com  a Zillow like website that markets international property to Chinese buyers  were 40 percent higher in the first quarter of 2017 than in all of 2016  the firm said  In the U S   there has also been a shift to lower priced homes as younger buyers look for investment properties  says Eric Dong  a Beijing based sales manager at  Lennar   NYSE LEN   a large U S  homebuilder   Seven or eight years ago  the buyer was older and they bought for self use  The average price was  1 4 million to  1 5 million   said Dong   In recent years  it s the younger generation     the average sales price is  300 000 to  500 000   The price of homes bought by Chinese buyers in the U S  has been trending lower  with a lot more families buying in college towns  Peter Turtzo  senior vice president of international operations at Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  HomeServices   part of Warren Buffet s giant investment company   said in an interview  His company recently partnered with Juwai to start marketing homes directly to Chinese buyers  There is some concern among buyers that new reporting rules for banks being introduced by the People s Bank of China from July 1 may have a further dampening impact  The banks will have to tell the authorities about all cross border foreign currency transactions of more than  10 000  Grace  40  an immigration consultant in Beijing who asked that her full name not be used  said she owns one house in Canada and is looking at buying another  but expressed concern about the change   Of course the capital controls are a big problem  I want to quickly transfer my assets out of the country before it gets worse   she said  The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in an emailed statement that the new rules clarify reporting requirements for financial institutions and do not impact foreign exchange purchases by individuals  OVERBUILDING Here on Long Island  there has   in particular   been an influx of Chinese into the neighborhoods near Jericho  such as Muttontown  Brookville  Old Westbury and Roslyn in recent years   But Jason Friedman  a real estate broker who also specializes in luxury housing on the north shore  said a building boom that began a couple of years ago in the area in response to the surge in Chinese buying interest is starting to weigh on the market now  Access to cash from China is rarely far away as a concern  He said two of his Chinese clients asked for deadline extensions about a year ago   They said they needed more time to bring the money over   The money came through eventually   There were no restraints at the beginning  and then   they turned off the faucet  There was a very short period when you had all the money and then suddenly it was taken away   Friedman said

169303,390819,LEN,U S  existing home sales race to more than 9 1 2 year high,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  home resales rose in October to their highest level in more than 9 1 2 years as homebuyers  buoyed by an improving labor market  took advantage of still low mortgage rates to snatch up properties after many were shut out during the busy summer selling season 
The jump in sales was further evidence of a pickup in economic growth early in the fourth quarter 
 You have to be pretty confident to buy a house   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York   Consumers certainly were in October  showing no hesitation whatsoever ahead of the presidential elections with its often harsh rhetoric and focus on all the things wrong with the economy  
While a recent surge in mortgage rates could hurt the housing market next year  the impact is likely to be modest given a labor market that is at or close to full employment 
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday existing home sales rose 2 0 percent to an annual rate of 5 6 million units last month  the highest level since February 2007 
The Realtors group attributed the rise in sales to  unrealized pent up demand   Tight supply over summer unleashed bidding wars  which pushed out some would be buyers  Opportunities for buyers during the autumn and winter months  usually quiet periods for home sales  are likely improving 
New listings last month typically stayed on the market for 41 days  up from 39 days in September  but down from 57 days a year ago  Economists had forecast sales slipping 0 5 percent to a 5 43 million unit pace in October  Sales were up 5 9 percent from a year ago  They rose in all four regions last month 
The report came on the heels of data last week showing a surge in housing starts  It also added to strong reports on retail sales and the labor market as well as improving manufacturing surveys in suggesting that the economy continued to gain speed early in the fourth quarter 
Rising homes sales suggest an increase in brokers  commission  which should boost the residential construction component in the government s gross domestic product report 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 3 6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  The economy grew at a 2 9 percent pace in the July September period  The strong economic growth outlook together with a tightening labor market are likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government bonds rose marginally  U S  stocks were almost flat after touching record highs  The PHLX housing index fell 0 30 percent 
Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton Inc  declined 0 98 percent and  Lennar  Corp  NYSE LEN  dropped 1 3 percent 
SUPPLY REMAINS TIGHT
The NAR said it expected home resales to average 5 36 million units this year  Despite last month s rise  existing home sales remain constrained by a persistent shortage of properties available for sale 
Sales could slow marginally next year following a run up in mortgage rates in the wake of this month s election of Republican candidate Donald Trump as the next president 
Trump s surprise victory has led to a surge in U S  government bond yields amid investor concerns that the business mogul s proposed expansionary fiscal policy agenda could fan inflation 
Mortgage rates closely track movements in U S  Treasury yields  Since the Nov  8 presidential election  the fixed 30 year mortgage rate has increased nearly 40 basis points to average 3 94 percent  according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac 
But the higher borrowing costs could encourage potential buyers to rush into the market in anticipation of further increases in interest rates  The NAR is forecasting existing home sales increasing to about 5 46 million units next year 
 Rising rates tend to get the attention of fence sitters  who actually have to now start making decisions   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania 
 Yes  some may not be able to get a mortgage  but prices will adjust  so I don t expect a significant dislocation in the housing market even if rates rise another one percentage point  
Housing is being supported by improving household formation as the tightening labor market boosts employment prospects for young adults  The dearth of homes for sale is keeping upward pressure on house prices  The median house price rose 6 0 percent from a year ago to  232 200 last month 
The number of unsold homes on the market slipped 0 5 percent from September to 2 02 million units  Supply was down 4 3 percent from a year ago and had declined for 17 straight months on a year on year basis 
At October s sales pace  it would take 4 3 months to clear the stock of houses on the market  down from 4 4 months in September  A six month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand 
While house price increases could make home purchasing expensive for first time buyers  it is raising equity for homeowners and enticing some to put their homes on the market ",2016-11-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-existing-home-sales-race-to-more-than-9-1-2-year-high-443010,443010

169307,390823,LEN,U S  new home sales fall  weekly jobless claims rise,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    New U S  single family home sales fell to a 10 month low in December after three straight months of solid gains  but the housing market recovery remains intact as a tightening labor market boosts wage growth  While other data on Thursday showed a bigger than expected increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week  the four week moving average of claims dropped to levels last seen in 1973   There was also good news on the economy with the goods trade deficit falling in December as exports rose  With trade expected to have weighed on economic growth in the fourth quarter  last month s rise in exports bodes well for output in early 2017  The Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 10 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536 000 units last month  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast single family home sales  which account for 8 9 percent of overall home sales  slipping 1 0 percent  Many economists did not believe that the decline in sales was in response to a recent run up in mortgage rates as applications for loans to purchase houses rose in December  A homebuilders survey also showed strong sales gains last month  Cold weather could have impacted on sales   December s decline is probably mostly a result of volatility rather than a drop in the underlying fundamentals for housing demand  despite the rise in mortgage rates   said David Berson  chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus  Ohio  New home sales  which are derived from building permits  are volatile on a month to month basis and subject to large revisions  Sales increased 12 2 percent to 563 000 units in 2016  the highest since 2007  With the labor market considered as being at or near full employment  and pushing up wages  demand for housing is likely to remain supported  But a chronic shortage of properties for sale remains an obstacle to a robust housing market   A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed the supply of previously owned homes for sale dropped to a 17 year low in December   The PHLX housing index  HGX  rose 0 67 percent on Thursday amid expectations that homebuilders would need to ramp up construction to meet demand for housing  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton  N DHI   gained 0 54 percent  and  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  climbed 0 53 percent  Shares in PulteGroup  N PHM  surged 5 11 percent as the No  3 homebuilder reported higher than expected quarterly profits  which were boosted by an increase in home sales and prices   The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies  Prices for U S  government debt fell  with the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note rising to a four week high  RISING MORTGAGE RATES  The fixed 30 year mortgage rate increased 43 basis points in December from November to an average of 4 20 percent  the highest since April 2014  according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac   Further increases are likely as the Federal Reserve has forecast three rate hikes this year  The U S  central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to a range of 0 50 percent to 0 75 percent   Last month  new single family homes sales rose 48 4 percent in the Northeast to their highest level since January 2008  They fell in the Midwest  the South and the West   The inventory of new homes on the market increased 4 0 percent to 259 000 units  the highest since August 2009  New housing stock  however  remains less than half of its peak during the housing boom  According to Jonathan Smoke  chief economist at realtor com  the acute shortage of previously owned homes has not been a boost to the new housing market because of supply constraints facing builders  including labor  land and finance    New home sales will likely outpace single family growth as builders sell more homes that haven t been started  but supply side constraints will likely keep that growth to single digits in 2017   said Smoke  In a separate report on Thursday  the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 22 000 to a seasonally adjusted 259 000 for the week ended Jan  21  Claims have now been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a healthy labor market  for 99 consecutive weeks   That is the longest stretch since 1970  when the labor market was much smaller  Last week s data included the Martin Luther King Jr  holiday  which could have impacted on the data  Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because of different timings of the various holidays    Through the volatility they continue to show no sign of an uptrend   said Jim O Sullivan  chief U S  economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla  New York   We believe the trend in employment growth remains quite strong  more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down   The four week moving average of claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  fell 2 000 to 245 500 last week  the lowest since November 1973  In another report  the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit fell 0 5 percent to  65 0 billion in December  Goods exports increased  3 7 billion to  125 5 billion  The rise outpaced a  3 4 billion gain in imports  Economists expect trade to have subtracted at least 1 5 percentage points from GDP in the fourth quarter reversing a 0 85 percentage point contribution the prior quarter   The export drag will likely come from a decline in soybean shipments  after they provided a huge boost to growth in the third quarter  The government will publish its advance fourth quarter GDP estimate on Friday

169308,390824,LEN,U S  housing starts fall  building permits hit one year high,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  homebuilding fell in January as the construction of multi family housing projects dropped  but upward revisions to the prior month s data and a jump in permits to a one year high suggested the housing recovery remained on track  Other reports on Thursday also offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy early in the first quarter  Factory activity in the mid Atlantic region vaulted to a 33 year high in February and the number of new applications for unemployment benefits was less than expected last week   There is not much to complain about the economy as housing and manufacturing are improving and the labor market remains tight  The economy is getting stronger   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania  Housing starts fell 2 6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 25 million units last month  the Commerce Department said  The drop in homebuilding also may have resulted from unusually wet weather in California after years of drought  December s starts were revised up to a rate of 1 28 million units from the previously reported pace of 1 23 million units  Homebuilding was up 10 5 percent compared to January 2016  Permits for future construction jumped 4 6 percent in January to a rate of 1 29 million units  the highest level since November 2015  Building permits in the South  where most homebuilding occurs  hit their highest level since July 2007  With overall permits now outpacing starts  homebuilding is likely to rebound in the coming months  Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity slipping to a rate of 1 22 million units last month and building permits rising to a 1 23 million pace  The PHLX housing index  HGX  fell 0 6 percent  U S  stocks were trading lower after earlier touching record highs  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton  N DHI   were little changed   Lennar  Corp  N LEN  fell 0 27 percent and PulteGroup  N PHM  was down 0 18 percent  Prices of U S  Treasuries rose while the dollar  DXY  fell against a basket of currencies  MANUFACTURING RECOVERY In a separate report  the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its general activity index jumped to 43 3 this month  the highest reading since January 1984  from 23 6 in February  Manufacturers in the mid Atlantic region reported a surge in new orders and shipments  Factories also extended working hours for employees this month  The Philadelphia Fed s data mirrored other regional surveys in suggesting a broad recovery in manufacturing  which was squeezed by the collapse in oil prices and a strong dollar over the past two years    We do expect to see an acceleration in manufacturing output and employment growth this year   said Paul Ashworth  chief U S  economist at Capital Economics in Toronto   But     we don t expect this revival to spill over into much faster GDP growth   While manufacturers continued to report paying higher prices for raw materials this month  fewer said they were raising prices for their goods compared to January  That suggests the growing inflation pressures at the factory gate will probably not translate into significant price increases for consumers   A government report on Wednesday showed the consumer price index increased 2 5 percent year on year in January  the biggest gain since March 2012  Rising inflation  if sustained  could erode households  purchasing power and hurt spending  including home purchases  The housing recovery is being driven by a strong labor market  which is boosting employment opportunities for young people and supporting household formation   In another report on Thursday  the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 239 000 for the week ended Feb  11  Claims have been below 300 000  a threshold associated with a strong job market  for 102 consecutive weeks  That is the longest stretch since 1970  when the labor market was much smaller  The labor market is at or close to full employment  with the unemployment rate at 4 8 percent   Economists had forecast first time applications for jobless benefits rising to 245 000 in the latest week  While the labor market is expected to continue to underpin the housing market  higher mortgage rates could slow demand for housing   January s starts were above the fourth quarter average  suggesting housing will again contribute to gross domestic product in the first three months of this year  Homebuilding last month surged 55 4 percent in the Northeast region of the country and jumped 20 0 percent in the South to the highest level since August 2007  Starts fell 41 3 percent in the West to the lowest level since March 2015  likely due to the soggy weather  Last month  single family homebuilding  which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market  climbed 1 9 percent to a pace of 823 000 units  Starts for the volatile multi family housing segment tumbled 10 2 percent to a rate of 423 000 units   Single family permits

169311,390827,LEN,Aecom  ACM  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of AECOM  ACM  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 4 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  40 56 in the previous session  AECOM has gained 51 3  since the start of the year compared to the 35 4  move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 21 2  return for the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on August 6  2019  Aecom reported EPS of  0 72 versus consensus estimate of  0 71 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 3 67  
For the current fiscal year  Aecom is expected to post earnings of  3 28 per share on  20 35 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 96 per share on  20 73 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 18 08  and 1 86   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Aecom may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Aecom has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 2X versus its peer group s average of 9 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 31  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Aecom currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Aecom passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Aecom shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Aecom Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Aecom have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Lennar  LEN   MasTec  MTZ   and Meritage  MTH   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Aecom  Still  the fundamentals for Aecom are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aecom-acm-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200473963,200473963
169312,390828,LEN,What Makes Lennar  LEN  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Lennar  LEN   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Lennar currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if LEN is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this homebuilder holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For LEN  shares are up 5 45  over the past week while the Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry is up 5 45  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 11 61  compares favorably with the industry s 9 1  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Lennar have increased 27 16  over the past quarter  and have gained 51 38  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 0 87  and 10 81   respectively 
Investors should also take note of LEN s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  LEN is averaging 4 092 943 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with LEN 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost LEN s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 31 to  5 49 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that LEN is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Lennar on your short list ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-lennar-len-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200476679,200476679

169340,390856,LEN,U S  housing  trade data boost third quarter GDP growth prospects,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    New U S  single family home sales unexpectedly rose in September  pointing to sustained demand for housing even as data for the prior three months were revised lower 
Other reports on Wednesday suggested a stronger pickup in economic growth in the third quarter than is currently anticipated  The goods trade deficit narrowed sharply  while both wholesale and retail inventories increased in September 
 A lot of the pieces of the puzzle have come back together in a positive direction  with a pickup in the export of goods to the rest of the world and new home sales   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York 
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 3 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593 000 units last month  pulling them close to a nine year high touched in July  However  the pace for the prior three months was revised down by a total of 85 000 units from previous estimates 
New home sales  which are derived from building permits  are volatile on a month to month basis and subject to large revisions  Sales increased 29 8 percent from a year ago 
Economists had forecast single family home sales  which account for about 9 8 percent of overall home sales  falling to a rate of 600 000 units last month 
 The housing market may not be booming but it is clearly moving forward at a steady pace   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   But the big problem is still the lack of inventory  Builders are cautious and tend to do very little speculative construction  
Despite the downward revisions  new home sales rose in the third quarter compared to the April June period  Residential construction  however  likely remained a mild drag on gross domestic product for a second straight quarter 
According to a Reuters survey of economists  GDP probably increased at a 2 5 percent rate in the third quarter  quickening from the second quarter s tepid 1 4 percent pace 
But advance data on Wednesday showing the goods trade deficit falling 5 2 percent to  56 1 billion in September amid strong exports suggested that third quarter GDP growth could exceed expectations 
In addition  wholesale inventories increased 0 2 percent in September and retail inventories rose 0 3 percent 
 Based on this morning s data  we now believe the boost from trade could be closer to a full percentage point  almost twice what we had expected   said Michelle Girard  chief economist at RBS  LON RBS  in Stamford  Connecticut 
 Even assuming some offset in farm inventories  and possibly business investment  we now look for real GDP growth in the third quarter to have advanced by 3 3 percent  
The government will publish its advance GDP growth estimate for the third quarter on Friday 
HOME BUILDING LAGGING
The broader PHLX housing index  HGX   which includes builders  building products and mortgage companies  was little changed in early afternoon trading  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   were slightly lower   Lennar  Corp  N LEN  rose 0 48 percent  while  Toll Brothers   N TOL  was flat 
Despite rising demand for housing  home building has been lagging  with builders complaining about land and labor shortages  Demand is being driven by rising wages as the labor market nears full employment  as well as by low mortgage rates 
 New home sales are still running ahead of single family housing starts when inventories of new and existing homes for sale are already very lean   said Ted Wieseman  an economist at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in New York 
 This should support much better future homebuilding activity if homebuilders can overcome what they ve described as supply side constraints on activity from shortages of qualified labor and lots  
Separately  the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for home loans for last week fell to their lowest level since January 
Last month  new single family homes sales rose in the Northeast  the Midwest and South  They fell in the West

169341,390857,LEN,What Makes Lennar  LEN  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Lennar  LEN   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Lennar basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Lennar  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Lennar
This homebuilder is expected to earn  5 39 per share for the fiscal year ending November  2019  which represents a year over year change of  15 1  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Lennar  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales increased 1 7 percent to an annual rate of 5 45 million units 
March s sales pace was revised slightly higher to 5 36 million units from the previously reported 5 33 million units 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales rising to a 5 40 million unit pace last month  Sales were up 6 0 percent from a year ago 
However  there were regional variations  Home sales surged in the Midwest by 12 1 percent last month and also rose in the Northeast while the South and West lost steam

169368,390884,LEN,U S  housing starts hurt by weakness in multi family units,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  housing starts slipped in May as the construction of multi family housing units dropped  but further gains in building permits signaled a rebound that would support economic growth in the second quarter 
Groundbreaking fell 0 3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1 16 million units  the Commerce Department said on Friday  May s decline followed a 4 9 percent surge in April  Building permits rose 0 7 percent to a 1 14 million unit rate in May 
 Another month of gains in building permits coupled with near record low mortgage rates provide opportunity for a bounce back   said Bill Banfield  vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit 
Though the pace of home building has slowed after a brisk first quarter  housing remains a pillar of strength for the economy  Residential construction added almost six tenths of a percentage point to first quarter gross domestic product  the biggest contribution in more than three years 
The economy grew at a 0 8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter  The Atlanta Federal Reserve left its growth forecast for the second quarter unchanged at a 2 8 percent pace after Friday s housing starts data 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a 1 15 million unit pace last month 
The S P homebuilding index rose 1 21 percent  outperforming a broadly weaker U S  stock market  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   advanced 1 31 percent and  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  gained 1 0 percent  Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers rallied 1 82 percent 
Prices for U S  government debt fell and the dollar  DXY  was trading lower against a basket of currencies 
GAINS IN THE SOUTH
Groundbreaking on single family homes  the largest segment of the market  rose 0 3 percent to a 764 000 unit pace last month  Single family starts in the American South  where most of the home building takes place  rose 2 6 percent to their highest level since December 2007 
Single family starts in the Northeast region surged 12 7 percent  In the West  groundbreaking on single family housing projects rose 1 9 percent  But single family starts in the Midwest tumbled 14 7 percent to a six month low 
Further gains in single family starts are likely after a survey on Thursday showed confidence among home builders rose to a five month high in June amid optimism over sales and buyer traffic  But single family home construction continues to run ahead of permits  which could limit the rise in the short term 
Housing starts for the volatile multi family segment fell 1 2 percent to a 400 000 unit pace last month  following an 11 9 percent jump in April  The multi family segment of the market continues to be supported by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans remain wary of owning homes years after the housing market collapse 
Multi family home construction is also being aided by rising household formation as a fairly strong labor market increases employment opportunities for young adults 
 There is some evidence of a pullback in multi family activity from very elevated levels seen in the summer of last year  but the strength of the rents data in the inflation report suggests that this is not a product of overbuilding   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York 
The government reported on Thursday that rents in May posted their biggest gain since February 2007  
Permits for the construction of single family homes fell 2 0 percent last month to a 726 000 unit rate  But single family permits in the South rose 0 8 percent to a five month high  Multi family building permits increased 5 9 percent to a 412 000 unit pace in May 

 We think the signals from the recent permits data  which are forward looking  are more indicative of the underlying trends  We look for continued improvement related to single family units over time but some cooling in the multifamily data   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York ",2016-06-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-housing-starts-hurt-by-weakness-in-multi-family-units-409039,409039

The blue chip Dow futures gained 68 points  or 0 38   by 10 54AM GMT  or 6 54AM ET  the S P 500 futures rose 10 points  or 0 48   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 22 points  or 0 50  
Markets continued to focus on the possibility of a Brexit  as a vote to leave in the U K  s June 23 referendum on EU membership is known  with the tide apparently continuing to sway towards a  Remain  victory 
Online betting service Betfair showed on Tuesday that there was a 77  chance the British public would vote to stay in the EU  up approximately 10  from the prior week s odds 
However  JP Morgan warned that the race was too close to call and polls released on Tuesday did show a mixed picture  despite surveys earlier in the week conceding a clearer victory for  Remain  
GBP USD continued to rise  hitting 1 4781 on Tuesday  its highest level since the EU referendum date was announced  lending credence to market confidence that the U K  would not choose a Brexit 
U S  markets were keeping a close eye on developments due to the impact a decision to leave could have on American companies in the U K  and risk factors from forex markets on exports in the event that Britain and Europe part ways 
Yellen had already warned in her June 15 press conference that a vote to leave  known as a Brexit   could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets  
 If it does so  it could have consequences in turn for the U S  economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy   she said 
In that light  Yellen was set to begin her two day congressional testimony on Tuesday with the Brexit concern in the background 
She will comment on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 14 00GMT  or 10 00AM ET  followed by an appearance in front of the House of Representatives  Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday 
Her appearance comes less than a week after the U S  central bank kept interest rates unchanged near record lows and lowered its projections for hikes in 2017 and 2018 
As the last meeting involved a press conference and the testimony still comes before Thursday s U K  referendum  expectations were understandably low for Yellen to present new clues on the future path of policy normalization 
However  investors will focus on her answers to lawmakers  questions to see if Congress might obtain fresh details 
Though the median forecast of Fed officials revealed in June was for two rate hikes this year  Fed fund futures put the odds at 54  for the increase to come in the December meeting 
In a session with no major economic reports  Yellen would be followed up with a speech from Fed governor Jerome Powell scheduled for 18 30GMT  or 14 30ET

169377,390893,LEN,Low mortgage rates boost U S  home sales to nine year high,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  home resales rose in May to a more than nine year high amid low mortgage rates  pointing to sustained housing market strength that should keep the economy on solid ground 
The fairly strong existing home sales report on Wednesday added to retail sales and international trade data in painting an upbeat picture of the economy in the second quarter  A sharp slowdown in job growth in May had cast doubts on whether growth was picking up after almost stalling in the first quarter 
 The housing market recovery is truly back on track      which should reinforce confidence that the economic recovery is moving in the right direction   said Millan Mulraine  deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York 
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales gained 1 8 percent to an annual rate of 5 53 million units last month  the highest level since February 2007 
April s sales pace was revised down to 5 43 million units from the previously reported 5 45 million units  Economists had forecast sales rising 1 1 percent to a 5 54 million unit pace in May  Sales were up 4 5 percent from a year ago 
U S  financial markets were little moved by the report as investors nervously awaited the outcome of Britain s referendum on European Union membership on Thursday 
But the PHLX housing index  HGX  rose 0 55 percent  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder  D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   gained 0 29 percent while  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  rose 0 93 percent 
Despite rising for three straight months  existing home sales remain constrained by a shortage of homes available for sale 
The dearth of properties is keeping home prices elevated  sidelining some first time buyers  The median house price soared 4 7 percent from a year ago to a record  239 700 last month  The rate of increase has  however  slowed from last year s brisk pace 
Demand for housing is being driven by historically low mortgage rates  improving household formation as some young adults find employment and older Americans move into smaller and cheaper homes 
The 30 year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3 60 percent in May  the lowest level since May 2013  according to mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac  Home resales are likely to increase in June  A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed mortgage applications increased 2 9 percent last week 
 TRADE UP BUYERS 
 The extended run of extraordinarily low mortgage rates is clearly bringing trade up buyers back into the market   said Mark Vitner  a senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina 
 Many buyers might have been hesitant to give up their current low rate mortgage that they refinanced into a few years ago  but now are looking at essentially the same mortgage rates that they were three years ago  
Last month  existing home sales surged 4 1 percent in the Northeast and climbed 4 6 percent in the South  Sales in the West  which has seen a strong increase in house prices amid tight inventories  jumped 5 4 percent 
In the Midwest  sales tumbled 6 5 percent last month  The decline  however  followed recent hefty gains 
While the number of unsold homes on the market in May rose 1 4 percent from April to 2 15 million units  supply was down 5 7 percent from a year ago 
In May  new listings typically stayed on the market for 32 days  the shortest period of time since the NAR started tracking the data  That was down from 39 days in April and 40 days a year ago 
At May s sales pace  it would take 4 7 months to clear the stock of houses on the market  unchanged from April  A six month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand 
Economists say builders will need to ramp up construction of new homes to meet the pent up demand  House price increases are outstripping wage gains  While that could make home purchasing expensive for first time buyers  it is boosting equity for homeowners and enticing some to put their homes on the market 
 We expect moderate price appreciation to increase homeowner equity  encouraging inventory expansion and sustaining the pace of existing home sales through 2016   said Kristin Reynolds  a U S  economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington  Massachusetts

169406,390922,LEN,U S  housing data signals economic strength  manufacturing weak,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  housing starts in November rebounded from a seven month low and permits surged to a five month high  signs of strength in the housing market as the Federal Reserve starts hiking interest rates after years of easy monetary policy 
Other data on Wednesday showed the industrial sector continuing to struggle under the weight of a strong dollar  cutbacks in inventory investment as well as spending cuts by energy firms in response to persistently low oil prices 
Groundbreaking jumped 10 5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1 17 million units last month  the Commerce Department said  Building permits vaulted 11 percent to a 1 29 million unit rate  the highest since June 
With permits running ahead of starts  home building is likely to remain supported in the months ahead 
The Fed on Wednesday raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points from near zero  the first rate hike in nearly a decade  The U S  central bank gave an upbeat assessment of the economy and noted that  the housing sector has improved further  
With the Fed making it clear that the tightening cycle is likely to be gradual  the increase in borrowing costs is not expected to derail the housing recovery 
 The interest rate is still low compared to historical standards   said Kevin Young  an analyst at IBISWorld in Los Angeles 
In a separate report  the Fed said industrial production fell 0 6 percent in November as unusually warm weather caused a sharp drop in demand for utilities 
The third straight monthly decline in industrial output also reflected another sharp fall in mining production  driven by a plunge in oil and gas well drilling  Manufacturing output was unchanged  However  motor vehicle production fell for the first time since August  a worrying signal for manufacturing 
 We expect the auto sector to remain a drag on total production in coming months  On balance  manufacturing activity is likely to remain weak as the U S  economy is still adjusting to the shocks of lower energy prices and weaker foreign demand   said Laura Rosner  an economist at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  in New York  U S  stocks were trading higher  with the S P homebuilding index rallying 1 98 percent  D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   the largest U S  homebuilder  rose more than 2 percent   Lennar  Corp  N LEN   the nation s second largest homebuilder  advanced 1 62 percent  The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies  DXY   while prices for U S  Treasury debt  US10YT RR  fell 
STRONG HOUSING FUNDAMENTALS
November marked the eighth straight month that housing starts remained above a 1 million unit annual pace  the longest stretch since 2007  Economists expect starts to average around 1 1 million units for 2015  which would be the highest since 2007 and up from 1 0 million in 2014 
Robust household formation as labor market strength encourages young adults to leave their childhood homes is underpinning the housing market recovery 
But the sector remains constrained by a persistent shortage of houses for sale  This has resulted in home prices rising faster than salaries  pushing more people towards renting 
 Tight inventories and high prices will provide the incentives for builders to continue ramping up activity   said Greg Daco  head of U S  macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York 
Single family housing starts  the largest segment of the market  increased 7 6 percent to a 768 000 unit pace  That was the highest reading since January 2008  Activity was probably also boosted by mild weather  Groundbreaking on single family projects rose in the South  Northeast and West  but fell in the Midwest 
Starts for the volatile multi family segment surged 16 4 percent to a 405 000 unit pace  That segment has been the driver of residential construction but a shift towards single family homes is expected in 2016 
 Homebuilders are making progress addressing the shortage of newer vintage single family homes we see in many markets  especially affordable housing products with a price of under  200 000   said Tian Liu  chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance in Raleigh  North Carolina

169407,390923,LEN,Strong U S  housing data offers ray of hope for slowing economy,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  home resales rebounded strongly in December from a 19 month low and prices surged  indicating the housing market recovery remained intact despite signs of a sharp deceleration in economic growth in recent months 
The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales jumped a record 14 7 percent to an annual rate of 5 46 million units  after being temporarily held back by the introduction of new mortgage disclosure rules  which had caused delays in the closing of contracts in November 
Sales were also boosted by unseasonably warm weather  November s sales pace was unrevised at 4 76 million units  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales rebounding 8 9 percent to a 5 20 million rate 
Sales rose 6 5 percent to 5 26 million units in 2015  the strongest since 2006  Last month s snap back suggests that
November s slump was a blip and should offer some assurance that domestic demand remains fairly healthy  even as growth appears to have braked sharply at the end of 2015 because of a downturn in manufacturing and mining activity 
 While the carryover of November s delayed transactions into December contributed to the sharp increase  the overall pace taken together indicates sales these last two months maintained the healthy level of activity seen in most of 2015   said Lawrence Yun  NAR chief economist 
Housing is being supported by a strengthening labor market  which has resulted in an acceleration in household formation  Sales  however  remain constrained by a dearth of homes available for sale  which is limiting choice for buyers 
The economy has been hammered by a strong dollar  slowing global demand and deep spending cuts in the energy sector  Businesses are also placing fewer orders with factories while trying to reduce piles of unsold merchandise  which also is putting pressure on the economy 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies  while prices for U S  government debt fell  The housing index rallied 3 6 percent  outperforming a broadly firmer U S  stock market  Shares in the nation s largest homebuilder D R  Horton Inc surged 4 16 percent and  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  advanced 3 9 percent 
A separate report hinted at some stabilization for the downtrodden manufacturing sector  Data firm Markit said its Purchasing Managers Index bounced back in early January from December s 38 month low as output and new business volumes increase at faster rates 
Weak reports on retail sales  inventories  exports and industrial production have left economists estimating that gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 2 percent pace in the July September quarter 
A massive stock market sell off  which has seen a sharp drop in the Standard   Poor s 500 index since Dec  31  is also adding to gloom over the economy 
In December  the number of unsold homes on the market tumbled 12 3 percent from November to 1 79 million units  the lowest level since January 2013  Supply was down 3 8 percent from a year ago  At December s sales pace  it would take 3 9 months to clear the stock of houses on the market  the fewest since January 2005  That was down from 5 1 months in November 
A six months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand  With inventories still tight  the median house price jumped 7 6 percent from a year ago to  224 100  House prices increased 6 7 percent in 2015

169409,390925,LEN,U S  new home sales rise on strong gains in the West,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    New U S  single family home sales rebounded modestly in February as a surge in the West offset sharp declines in other regions  pointing to a gradually improving housing sector amid a dearth of properties available on the market 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday home sales rose 2 0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 512 000 units  January s sales pace was revised up to 502 000 units from the previously reported 494 000 units 
 The housing market is improving  though in fits and starts and not uniformly across the nation   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania 
New single family home sales were driven by a 38 5 percent jump in the West last month  which reversed January s 32 7 percent dive  Sales plunged 24 2 percent in the Northeast and tumbled 17 9 percent in the Midwest  They fell 4 1 percent in the populous South 
Excluding the West  home sales were down 8 1 percent  New home sales account for about 9 2 percent of the housing market 
The report came on the heels of data on Monday showing a 7 1 percent drop in sales of previously owned homes in February  which was blamed on tight inventories  bad weather and difficulties adjusting the data during the month with a leap day 
The S P homebuilding index was down 0 88 percent  in line with a broadly weaker U S  stock market 
Shares in D R  Horton Inc  N DHI   the largest U S  homebuilder  fell 1 4 percent and rival  Lennar  Corp  N LEN  slipped 0 8 percent 
DECENT SPRING SELLING SEASON
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a dip in home buying activity last week  with its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index falling 1 0 percent from a week earlier  The index  however  increased 25 percent from a year ago 
While economists and realtors expect a fairly busy spring selling season  they caution that the persistent shortage of homes on the market  which is limiting options for buyers and pushing up prices  was a challenge 
 Existing and new home prices are rising quickly and that s really taking a bite out of housing affordability  New and existing home inventories are very lean  that can hurt sales   said Ryan Sweet  senior economist at Moody s Analytics in Westchester  Pennsylvania 
 Spring sales should be decent  but won t be as good as they could have been if there was more inventory on the market and affordability was a little bit stronger  
There were 1 88 million existing homes available for sale in February  up 3 3 percent from January  but 1 1 percent lower than a year ago  House prices have been rising by more than 5 percent  outpacing wage growth 
While the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1 7 percent in February to the highest level since October 2009  it remained less than half of what it was at the height of the housing bubble 
At February s sales pace it would take 5 6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market  unchanged from January 
With the strengthening labor market boosting household formation and mortgage rates still low by historical standards  housing fundamentals remain solid  The sector should continue to contribute to economic growth this year 

 We expect the housing market to continue to be a moderate but unremarkable contributor to growth for the remainder of 2016   said Sophia Kearney Lederman  and economic analyst at FTN Financial in New York ",2016-03-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-new-home-sales-rise-on-strong-gains-in-the-west-391551,391551

169422,390938,LEN,Lennar Or D R  Horton  Which Is A Better Housing Pick Now ,opinion,Post a sharp sell off in the second half of 2018  declining mortgage rates and solid economic fundamentals have been adding strength to U S  homebuilding companies like Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN    D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI    PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   and Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL    Builders remain optimistic about the housing industry s prospects  given rising wages  lower unemployment and decreased borrowing costs Given the current scenario  quality homebuilding stocks could offer a safe haven because of their stability and the fact that these are fundamentally strong enough to withstand the industry woes Among the industry bellwethers  Lennar and D R  Horton are the most prominent ones Before drawing a head to head comparison between Lennar and D R  Horton  let s check out a few key statistics of the companies What Defines the Housing Giants In terms of market capitalization  the two companies are almost neck to neck  With a market cap of  17 4 billion  D R  Horton offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi brand platform  Moreover  the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market The company is primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of land  and construction and sale of residential homes  D R  Horton is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets  Its recent acquisitions were that of Westport Homes  Classic Builders and Terramor Homes  Courtesy of these buyouts  the homebuilder acquired approximately 700 homes in inventory  4 500 lots and control of approximately 4 300 additional lots through land purchase contracts  It also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 700 homes  Westport Homes operates in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne  Indiana  and Columbus  Ohio  Classic Builders operates in Des Moines  Iowa  and Terramor Homes operates in Raleigh  North Carolina Conversely  Miami based Lennar   with a market cap of  15 9 billion   operates as a homebuilder  primarily under the Lennar brand in the United States  targeting first time  move up  and active adult homebuyers  The company provides mortgage financing and related services to customers through the financial services segment  Lennar s acquisition of CalAtlantic Group Inc  in February 2018 made it one of the country s largest homebuilders in the top U S  markets YTD Stock PerformanceD R  Horton and Lennar have gained 38 4  and 28 4   respectively  so far this year  The Homebuilding industry has collectively gained 32 1  during the period  Hence  D R  Horton fared much better than Lennar in this parameter  Earnings Growth Rate   SurprisesThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies  Analysts expect D R  Horton s earnings to grow at a 11  rate over the next three to five years  Comparatively  Lennar s earnings are expected to grow 8 6  over the same time frame  Hence  D R  Horton s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation D R  Horton is expected to witness 2  y y earnings growth whereas Lennar s earnings are expected to decline 16 4  in the current year Hence  D R  Horton is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectation Meanwhile  considering a more comprehensive earnings history  Lennar delivered a positive surprise in three of the last four quarters  while D R  Horton came up with positive surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  Lennar has a superior average earnings surprise of 8 5  compared with D R  Horton s 5 9  Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company s business and growth opportunities  Return on Capital  ROC  of Lennar is 7 4   while that of D R  Horton and the homebuilding industry is 12 3  and 8 7   respectively  This signifies that D R  Horton s business generates a higher return on investment than Lennar s Return on Equity  ROE  is a measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds  ROE in the trailing 12 months for Lennar and D R  Horton is 12  and 16 7   respectively  While Lennar has met the industry level of 12   D R  Horton has an edge here ValuationLet s have a look at the stocks  P E  P B and P S ratios compared with the homebuilding industry The trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  multiple for Lennar and D R  Horton is 9 3 and 11 5  respectively  while that of the industry is 9 6  Lennar s shares are cheaper than D R  Horton Again  trailing 12 month price to book  P B  multiple for Lennar is 1 06 compared with 1 81 for D R  Horton  The industry s P B is 1 17x Trailing 12 month price to sales  P S  multiples for Lennar and D R  Horton are 0 75 and 1 06  respectively  compared with the industry s 0 79 Lennar is the cheaper of the two stocks on a P E  P B and P S basis VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock  investors use beta  Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole  Conversely  a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk  Lennar and D R  Horton have a beta of 1 14 and 1 08   above 1   considering the ongoing housing market headwinds Bottom LineD R  Horton   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock   appears to be a comparatively better investment option than the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Lennar  D R  Horton is also better than Lennar in terms of earnings growth expectation and share price performance  You can see  Nonetheless  both the companies remain positive about the overall homebuilding market  which will continue to gain on solid demand for homes

169459,390975,LEN,Home Construction Stock Making Big Moves Before Earnings,opinion,"Home construction concern Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  is up 1  at  51 83 this afternoon  continuing its long term climb on the charts  Traders are gearing up for the company s second quarter report  slated for before the market opens tomorrow  June 25  Down below we will take a look as to how Lennar stock has been performing on the stock market ahead of its highly anticipated earnings 
Lennar stock has been moving mostly higher since its late December bottom of  37 29  In fact  just last month the shares touched a year to date peak of  54 50  A majority of pullbacks over the past year have been captured by the supportive 80 day moving average  guiding the equity to its current year to date lead of 31 1  

Moving onto Lennar s earnings history  the stock has closed higher the day after earnings in seven of the past eight quarters    including a 10  surge April 2018  Over the past two years  the shares have swung an average of 4 7  the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a larger than usual 6 6  swing for Tuesday s trading 
Looking at options  near term options traders are unusually call skewed on Lennar  according to its Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 0 35  This reading ranks in the 8th annual percentile  showing that call open interest outweighs put open interest among contracts expiring within three months by a wider than usual margin 
This is echoed at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   which shows LEN with a 10 day call put volume ratio of 10 59  ranking in the highest percentile of its annual range  In other words  calls have been bought over puts at a much quicker than usual pace ",2019-06-25,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-construction-stock-making-big-moves-before-earnings-200434358,200434358
169460,390976,LEN,Lennar  LEN  Stock Falls Despite Earnings Beat As Trade Concerns Grow,opinion,"Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   reported earnings of  1 30 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 13  an EPS surprise of  15 04   The company s reported earnings sent the stock up as much as 3 6  but closed down over 6  on the day  Their strong report stemmed from an improving housing market that has since recovered from 2018 who felt the weight of rising interest rates and home prices  Lennar reported that home sales increased 5  to 12 729 topping the company s previous forecasts of between 11 700 12 000  Orders also increased 0 5  to 14  518  which also toppled previous projections of 14 300  The homebuilding company was able to bring in revenues of 1 9  to  5 56 billion  
In spite of these better than expected results  Lennar confirmed its full year outlook of selling around 50 000 homes  This cautious revenue guidance possibly reflects the deceleration of economic growth  Additionally   about future home sales in the U S for the remainder of 2019  as the stimulus from the Trump administration tax cuts and spending increases fades 
Growing concerns from the ongoing U S China trade war added to the growing worries about the housing market and homebuilders  Lennar issued a warning stating that an escalation of the trade war would lead to tariffs on Chinese goods  driving up material costs  To help offset these costs  the homebuilding company has priced in the tariffs at a  500 increase per home  Growing uncertainty would deter foreign buyers from large housing hubs such as California  which is Lennar s most prominent revenue stream 
Lennar is currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The company has had a solid year to date return  shares are currently up 31   and the stock is up 11 44  relative to the S P 500  The company has been able to surpass our consensus estimate three out of the previous four quarters for an average earnings surprise of 67 51   Despite these earning beats  Lennar has a Style Score of F in Growth  as our current consensus estimate is calling for a 14 65  decrease in earnings for the current fiscal year 
With the manner in which things are moving relative to the trade relations between the U S and China  the homebuilding company must look for reassurance from the upcoming G 20 summit where President Trump and President Xi are expected to meet and restart trade talks  If the two countries can find common ground  the stock s valuation could potentially bring investors back to Lennar  as the stock has historically been trading at a discount relative to its respective industry the past three years

169485,391001,LEN,Will Lower Revenues Mar Toll Brothers  TOL  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Toll Brothers Inc    NYSE TOL   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 21  after market close  In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings came in at 76 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 6   In fact  the stock outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing five quarters First quarter fiscal 2019 revenues of  1 36 billion also topped the consensus mark of  1 29 billion  The bottom line fell 8 4  from the year ago profit level but the top line increased 16   reflecting higher deliveries and pricing How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 77 cents per share  remaining unchanged over the past 30 days  This is indicative of a decline of 2 5  from the year ago reported figure  Revenues are expected to be  1 54 billion  down 3 6  year over year  Toll Brothers Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors That Might Influence Q2 ResultsSoftness in homebuying demand  owing to affordability challenges and general market uncertainty  is expected to impact the company s order flow  That said  since the beginning of calendar year 2019  the U S  housing market has been regaining strength  courtesy of declining mortgage rates and moderating home prices  Also  favorable job market and economic conditions are expected to provide support to some extent in mitigating the headwinds in the quarter to be reported For the fiscal second quarter  the company expects home deliveries between 1 650 units and 1 850 units  versus 1 886 units delivered in the prior year period  It mostly serves luxury move up buyers who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger homes  These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes  Toll Brothers enjoys greater pricing power than other homebuilding companies  which is a positive for the to be reported quarter as well  The company expects average price of homes delivered between  860 000 and  890 000  versus  847 900 a year ago  Meanwhile  we are concerned about escalating building material and labor costs that are proving to be a drag on the company s margins  Toll Brothers expects adjusted gross margin in the fiscal second quarter to be approximately 23 1  compared with 18 8  in the year ago period Moreover  the company expects SG A expenses to be approximately 11 3  of revenues  comparing unfavorably with the year ago figure of 10 4  Overall  lower revenues arising from lower deliveries are expected to impact the top line  Again  higher discounts and incentives to drive volume will likely compress its gross margins  Also  de leverage in the SG A to sales ratio  mainly due to reduced closings  is expected to impact the company s bottom line Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not conclusively show that Toll Brothers is likely to beat on earnings in the to be reported quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a

169496,391012,LEN,Why Lennar  LEN  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Lennar  LEN   which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry 
This homebuilder has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 13  
For the most recent quarter  Lennar was expected to post earnings of  1 91 per share  but it reported  1 96 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 62   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 19 per share  while it actually produced  1 40 per share  a surprise of 17 65  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Lennar lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Lennar has an Earnings ESP of  5 33  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on March 27  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-03-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lennar-len-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200401079,200401079

169506,391022,LEN,U S  inflation surprisingly weak  Fed keeps low rates pledge,news,"By Lucia Mutikani  WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  consumer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1 1 2 years in August and underlying inflation pressures were muted  which could lessen the urgency for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates   The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index dropped 0 2 percent last month as a broad decline in energy prices offset increases in food and shelter costs   It was the first decrease since April last year and followed a modest 0 1 percent gain in July  Economists had expected consumer prices would be flat in August    There is still enough slack in the economy to keep a tight lid on price increases  which should support the view of those within the Fed arguing in favor of patience before the first rate hike   said Anthony Karydakis  chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York   The Fed  at the end of the two day policy meeting  on Wednesday renewed a pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a  considerable time   However  it issued projections that suggested the U S  central bank might raise borrowing costs a bit quicker than it had been thinking a few months ago   Concerns at the Fed that inflation was running too low have abated in recent months  but the CPI data suggested an acceleration of prices during the spring may have run its course   The CPI increased 1 7 percent in the 12 months through August  the smallest advance in five months  while a core index that strips out food and energy prices was up by the same amount  marking a slowdown from July s 1 9 percent gain   Month on month  the core index was unchanged for the first time since October 2010  The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI   Many economists think the central bank could raise interest rates as soon as next June  while interest rate futures point to July for the first rate hike  It has kept benchmark overnight lending rates near zero since December 2008   WAGE GROWTH SLUGGISH  The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on perceptions of a faster pace of rate hikes  touching its highest level since July last year  Prices for U S  government debt fell  Stocks on Wall Street rose marginally   While the economy appears to be on sustainable growth path  anemic wage growth is dampening price pressures  Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0 4 percent in August  Even so  they have risen only by that same amount over the past year   A second report showed homebuilder sentiment hit a near nine year high in September  with builders reporting a sharp pickup in buyer traffic since early summer  The surge in confidence underscores the economy s firming fundamentals   The upbeat housing report  and better than expected earnings from homebuilder Lennar Corp  N LEN   pushed up housing stocks  which were solidly outperforming the broader market  The S P homebuilding index  was up 3 65 percent    While an inflationary surge is not in the offing  with the economy continuing to recover in the second half  there is a better than even chance for a modest acceleration in inflation   said Steve Blitz  chief economist at ITG in New York In August  energy prices fell for a second straight month  recording their biggest decline since March 2013  There were broad declines in energy prices  with the cost of gasoline falling by the most since April last year   Food prices rose 0 2 percent after advancing 0 4 percent in July as the effects of a drought in California lingered   A second straight month of sharp declines in airline fares dampened the core CPI  Falling apparel and used car prices also weighed  Recreation prices recorded their largest drop since December 2009  while household furnishings declined and college tuition and fees saw their biggest fall in almost 27 years

169518,391034,LEN,U S  February Housing Data   A Preview,opinion,"Coming up this week  we have a series of data releases relating to the US housing situation  However  these might be a bit overshadowed considering the all important NFP release coming up at the end of the week 
We ve discussed previously how housing data influences the currency markets  And of course  it s a matter of latent concern following the subprime crisis  At the end of the year  we had data points giving some warning signs  so given the raft of important housing data coming up  has anything changed 
What are analysts looking at when it comes to the US housing market 
Schedule and ExpectationsWe get the first peek at housing data on Tuesday  at 16 00 CET  or 10 00 EST  with the New Home Sales data 
This has been delayed data due to the partial government shutdown  While an important bit of data for the market  it s not expected to have much immediate effect 
New home deliveries surprised on the upside the last time they were published  for November   Currently  projections are for further good data in December despite the broader downturn in the markets at the time  New home sales are expected to fall month over month by just 2 2  to 609K homes 
Then we jump to Friday  when we will be getting the bulk of the housing data at the same time as the NFP  14 30 CET  or 08 30 EST   The jobs report is going to overshadow the housing data release  but that doesn t mean that its potential effect on the market should be ignored 
In fact  it could temper or exaggerate the response to the report and inject further volatility  This set of data has also been a casualty of the shutdown and corresponds to January Housing starts and building permits 
Expectations are for building permits to have remained largely stable at 1 323M compared to 1 326M in the prior month  Housing starts are expected to increase to 1 27M from 1 08M 
US Housing SituationHousing is intimately related to the Fed and interest rate policy because well over 70  of homes are bought with debt  Existing homes are also refinanced with debt  Therefore mortgage rates are seen as a predictor of where the market really thinks rates are going  This  in turn  affects the affordability of homes for people and buying patterns across America 
The 30 year average mortgage rate peaked at a 7 year high in mid November while there were still expectations that the Fed would continue its tightening cycle  However  with the change in interest rate outlook  mortgage rates have been declining since then  They have now slipped to 4 35   the lowest since January of 2018 
Last week we had home sales data from the National Association of Realtors showing that home sales were back on the rise after falling in December  A report that homeownership is at a four year high then followed  However  despite that  housing inventory remains high  though has slipped a bit from its most recent peak in October 
Sales TrendsIf we look a little deeper into the data  we find that average prices are on the rise  DR Horton  NYSE DHI   the largest US home builder  reported price increases of 7  annual  Even still  many Americans are opting for cheaper options The CEO of DR Horton acknowledged during their Q1 conference call that the top end of their pricing options hare having issues selling  In fact  in January  unofficial new home sales slipped by 8  even though homeownership was higher as a whole 
This indicates that in response to increasing house inflation  people are opting for cheaper options  such as used homes  Thus  this explains the growing divide between the median household price and the average household price 
The CEOs of both of the largest homebuilders in the US  DR Horton  and Lennar  NYSE LEN   agreed that the market remains attractive  In fact  they continue to see house prices rising by a further  7  
If the Fed holds off on further rate increases and mortgage rates continue their decline  they might just be right  After all  delinquency rates continue to drop   though they are still far from the pre crisis average ",2019-03-05,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-february-housing-data--a-preview-200394653,200394653

169521,391037,LEN,Homebuilding Industry Outlook  Near Term Prospects Bleak,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings  Some of the industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Improving economic conditions  rising disposable income and favorable demographic changes are continuing to support demand  The U S  economy is clearly on a solid footing given impressive labor market  low unemployment rate  rising wages and modest inflation  This is expected to boost housing activity and provide the basis for stronger demand in the near term  Meanwhile  the U S  Federal Reserve s dovish monetary stance is certainly a boon for the rate sensitive housing market  Raw material prices   which have been increasing double digits over the past few months due to the initial effects of tariffs on items like steel  aluminum and softwood lumber   are now rising low single digits  This should provide a meaningful boost to margins in the near term  However  the operating backdrop has been tough for the U S  homebuilding space since the second half of 2018  thanks to rising mortgage rates  higher construction costs  shortage of skilled labor and a dearth of buildable lots  Lower supply of homes has pushed home prices higher in several parts of the country  This  along with rising mortgage rates  is making houses less affordable for buyers  mostly the first time ones   Meanwhile  homebuilders continue to be apprehensive about the industry s prospects considering rising land  labor and transportation costs Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry is a 17 stock group within the broader Zacks  Sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  241  which places it at the bottom 5  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates dismal near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 5  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since October 2018  the industry s earnings estimates for 2019 have gone down approximately 19 6  Despite the industry s dull near term prospects  we will present a few homebuilding stocks that one can hold on to  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder return and current valuation first Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry has lagged the broader Zacks Construction Sector as well as the S P 500 index over the past year Over this period  the industry has declined 17  versus the broader sector s decline of 14  and the S P 500 Index gain of 4 3  One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is commonly used for valuing homebuilding stocks  the industry is currently trading at 9 4X compared with the S P 500 s 16 8X and the sector s 13 1X Over the last five years  the industry has traded as high as 15 2X  as low as 6 9X  with the median at 11 5X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500 Bottom LineThe recent softening of home price appreciation  historically low mortgage rates and Fed s dovish stance should give a boost to the spring homebuying season  However  rates are higher compared with the year ago period that might affect demand  Meanwhile  concerns surrounding limited supply and higher material  freight and labor costs have been eating into builders  margins over the past several quarters Currently  there is only one top ranked stock in the Zacks Building Products   Home Builders

169522,391038,LEN,Rate Sensitive ETFs In Focus Ahead Of Fed Meeting,opinion,All eyes are currently on the crucial two day FOMC meeting slated to start today  The Fed is expected to hold off rates with a wait and see approach for the time being  Per the CME Group s FedWatch tool  market expectations for a rate hike are at zero while options markets are currently pricing in a 98 7  chance that rates will remain unchanged and a 1 3  chance of a rate cut In its latest minutes  the central bank has signaled that it is not in a hurry to hike rates this year  citing mounting risks in the U S  economy including a slowdown in Chinese and European economies and lowering benefits from 2018 tax cuts  Earlier this year  the Fed suspended a three year movement to raise rates and stated that it will keep its short term interest rates between 2 25  and 2 50   read    Further  a separate statement issued in January also indicated that the Fed plans to be patient with its balance sheet reduction The Fed s dovish stance and dimming prospects of rate hikes at least in the near term has pushed Treasury yields lower  which in turn  is benefiting rate sensitive and high yield sectors  such as utilities and real estates  Additionally  global headwinds like still yet to be materialized trade deal  Brexit  geopolitical tensions and global growth worries are making investors jittery  raising the appeal for stocks from these sectors  This is because these often act as a safe haven in times of market turbulence and offer higher returns due to their outsized yields As a result  investors could make a near term bet on rate sensitive sectors in the basket form as these will continue to trade smoothly if interest rates remain steady  Below  we have highlighted some ETFs from these sectors that could be excellent plays ahead of the Fed s decision iShares Mortgage Real Estate ETF This is the most popular mortgage REIT ETF with AUM of  1 3 billion and average daily volume of 319 000 shares  It

concentrated on the top two firms at a combined 29 4  share while other firms make up for less than 8 4  of the assets  It charges investors 48 bps a year in fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold

169527,391043,LEN,Analysts Estimate Lennar  LEN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Lennar  LEN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on March 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 75 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  32 4  
Revenues are expected to be  4 08 billion  up 37  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lennar 
For Lennar  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lennar will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lennar would post earnings of  1 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 96  delivering a surprise of  2 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lennar doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-03-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-lennar-len-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200399479,200399479

opening bell on Mar 27 In the last reported quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 6   while revenues missed the same by 1 1   This Miami based homebuilder surpassed expectations in all the trailing four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 73  How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been revised downward over the past 60 days to 75 cents per share  This reflects a decrease of 32 4  from the year ago earnings of  1 11 per share  Nonetheless  revenues are expected to increase 37  year over year to  4 08 billion Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Key FactorsHomebuilding  Robust backlog position and increased traffic on the back of improved consumer confidence  wage growth and lower mortgage rates are expected to be conducive to the company s revenues  Lennar ended fourth quarter fiscal 2018 with a sales backlog of 15 616 homes and total dollar value of  6 6 billion  up 75  and 85   respectively  from the 2017 level  The company expects deliveries in the to be reported quarter within 9 000 9 500 units compared with 6 765 units reported a year ago Meanwhile  the company expects new orders in the 9 700 10 000 range compared with 8 456 in first quarter fiscal 2018  Average sales price is expected at about  410 000 versus  395 000 in the year ago period For the to be reported quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s Homebuilding segment revenues  comprising 92 8  of its total revenues  is pegged at  3 85 billion  depicting an increase from  2 66 billion in the year ago period but a decline from  6 07 billion in the last reported quarter  This year over year improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and deliveries  Lennar is expected to gain from its dynamic pricing model that will enable it to price homes according to the current market conditions as they evolve From the margins perspective  Lennar expects fiscal first quarter gross margin in the range of 20 20 5   compared with 19 5  reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2018   In the last reported quarter  gross margin on home sales was 21 4   Excluding backlog and construction in process write up  fiscal fourth quarter 2018 gross margin on home sales totaled 22 1   down 30 basis points year over year  The decline was due to higher construction costs that were partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and sales incentives Indeed  the housing market has been exhibiting a decelerating trend in recent times  putting up many hurdles for homebuilders  Labor shortages  higher construction costs  limited land availability  and increases in new and existing home sale prices have been making things worse  Lennar is not an exception in this regard  Higher construction and land costs have been creating pressure on the company s gross margin over the last few quarters Nonetheless  Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG A  selling  general and administrative  line  owing to operating leverage and investments in technology  SG A expenses  as a percentage of home sales  are estimated within 9 5 9 8  compared with 9 7  a year ago For the Financial Services segment  the consensus estimate for the segment s revenues is pegged at  191 million  reflecting an increase from  171 million in the year ago period but a decline from  228 million in fiscal fourth quarter 2018 For the combined category of joint ventures  land sales and other  Lennar expects overall loss of approximately  15 million in the fiscal first quarter What the Zacks Model UnveilsLennar does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a

MarginsGross margin on home sales was 21 4  in the quarter  Excluding the above mentioned backlog construction in progress write up  gross margin on home sales was 22 1   down 30 bps year over year

the last reported quarter  the company s earnings came in at  2 08 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 3   Revenues of  2 46 billion also topped the consensus mark of  2 33 billion  In fact  the stock outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters  with average positive surprise of 14 3  Meanwhile  fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings grew 78  from the year ago profit level  Revenues also increased by an impressive 21  year over year  reflecting higher deliveries and pricing How are Estimates Faring Let s take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 63 cents per share  remaining unchanged over the past 60 days  This reflects flat year over year growth  Revenues are expected to be  1 28 billion  up 8 7  year over year Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsDespite a healthy economy  ongoing housing market headwinds  comprising rising interest rates and home prices  affected the company s fiscal fourth quarter new orders  which declined for the first time in four years  Contracts in the quarter decreased 15  in dollars and 13  in units  While concerns surrounding affordability and rising mortgage rates have been plaguing the industry of late  Toll Brothers  like other homebuilders  remains optimistic about the ongoing traffic trends that indicate higher inclination of buyers  thereby reflecting a slow but steady housing recovery For first quarter fiscal 2019  the company expects home deliveries between 1 350 units and 1 550 units  versus 1 423 units delivered in the prior year period  at average price of  850 000  880 000  versus  826 000 a year ago  It mostly serves luxury move up buyers who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger homes  These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes  Toll Brothers enjoys greater pricing power than other homebuilding companies  leading to strong earnings  revenues  contracts and backlog growth Toll Brothers has been recording double digit growth over the last few quarters  The trend continued in fiscal 2018 as well  with the company recording double digit growth in revenues  up 23   and deliveries  up 16  in units   following respective gains of 12  and 17  in fiscal 2017  This reflects the health of the luxury new home market  Management believes that Toll Brothers remains well positioned to benefit from robust economy  improving demographics and

  Updates to early afternoon 
 By Ryan Vlastelica
 NEW YORK  Sept 24  Reuters    U S  stocks slid on Thursday 
as world central banks said they would scale back infusions of
U S  dollars into their banking systems and after weak U S 
housing data 
 The markets dropped on news that the Federal Reserve  along
with other central banks  would reduce programs to provide
institutions with short term liquidity  a sign the removal of
monetary stimulus was under way 
 Existing home sales unexpectedly fell in August  following
several months of strong reports that investors interpreted as
evidence the housing market had reached bottom 
  Perfection is priced into the market  and anything less
than that is going to result in a pullback   said Harry Rady 
the chief executive officer of Rady Asset Management in San
Diego 
  If there s any more weak data ahead  and the home sales
data suggests to me that we ll see more weak data  I think
we re going to keep seeing pullbacks  
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 57 43 points  or

Composite Index  sank 30 01 points  or 1 41 percent  at

 The central bank news came a day after a Fed policy
statement indicated it would start to reduce support for
financial markets  sparking a selloff in stocks 
  You can t continue to bail out this economy without
negative ramifications   said Joe Saluzzi  co manager of
trading at Themis Trading in Chatham  New Jersey 
 The Dow Jones U S  Home Construction index  D fell 1 6
percent while Lennar dropped 4 1 percent to  14 87 and D R 
Horton sank 3 4 percent to  12 03 
  This makes me extremely bearish on consumer spending  
Rady said   This could be one of many signs of what s to
come

 NEW YORK  Sept 29  Reuters    U S  stocks fell slightly on
Tuesday after data on consumer confidence and home prices gave
a mixed picture of the economy 
 After opening higher  stocks turned negative on the
Conference Board s Consumer Confidence Index  which fell short
of Wall Street expectations 
 But declines were limited as homebuilders  shares got a
boost from stronger than expected readings on home prices for
July 
  When a bad piece of data comes out  especially after a run
like this  people tend to be hesitant   said Doug Roberts 
chief investment strategist  Channel Capital Research com 
Shrewsbury  New Jersey 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 24 33 points  or

 fell 1 86 points  or 0 17 percent  to 1 061 12  The Nasdaq

2 121 49 
 The Dow had gained 124 points on Monday as news of
corporate deals boosted market sentiment on the view that
companies had confidence about the future and that more
acquisitions could be coming 
  Window dressing     when fund managers sell laggards in
favor of outperformers to spruce up portfolios    as the third
quarter draws to an end also could account for the muted
losses  Roberts said

was 21 4  in the quarter compared with 22 4  a year ago  Excluding the above mentioned backlog construction in progress write up  gross margin on home sales was 22 1   The decline was due to higher construction costs that were partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered As a percentage of home sales  SG A  selling  general and administrative  expenses improved 50 basis points to 7 9  from 8 4  a year ago  The improvement was due to improved operating leverage  owing to higher home deliveries  Benefits from technology initiatives also added to the positives

   Home builders  stocks gain

  Updates to late afternoon 
 By Caroline Valetkevitch
 NEW YORK  June 25  Reuters    U S  stocks rose sharply on
Thursday  helped by consumer discretionary shares after Bed
Bath   Beyond Inc posted a surprising profit increase and home
builder Lennar Corp reported a rise in new home sales 
 Lennar posted a wider quarterly loss  but noted an
increase in new sales and orders  Its stock shot up 16 5
percent to  9 11 
 The Dow Jones U S  home construction index jumped 5 7
percent 
 Gains in home builders and retailers point to signs of
strength in consumer spending  which could be a boon for
stocks just as the second quarter earnings reporting period
gets under way 
  To us  this is a market that wants to move higher  I
think the market s recovering from that 6 percent decline 
from recent highs  said Tim Ghriskey  chief investment officer
of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills  New York 
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 149 86 points  or
1 81 percent  at 8 449 72  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index
was up 16 53 points  or 1 83 percent  at 917 47  The Nasdaq
Composite Index was up 30 93 points  or 1 73 percent  at
1 823 27 
 Earlier  all three indexes gained as much as 2 percent to
2 29 percent to hit session highs 
 Another sign that encouraged investors was news the
Federal Reserve was extending a number of emergency funding
facilities while scaling back some others 
  What we saw is an improvement here in that one program
went away  but also the flexibility that these other ones are
staying around in case they re needed   said Bucky Hellwig 
senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management  in
Birmingham  Alabama 
 An auction of  27 billion of 7 year notes attracted strong
demand  pressuring U S  Treasury bond yields  The auction
completed this week s sales of Treasury coupons  with all
three auctions seeing solid demand 
 In the retail sector  Bed Bath   Beyond reported a
surprising increase in quarterly profit as it cut costs to
offset slumping demand  and its stock gained 10 2 percent to
 31 29  The retail index climbed 3 8 percent 
 There was also some relief in the market that Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke had weathered a tough grilling
in Congress relatively well

169593,391109,LEN,Stocks Down More Than 4  This Week,opinion,"The week started so well on Monday with a more than 1  advance following Fed Chair Jerome Powell s  just below neutral  speech on Nov 28 and a 90 day delay in further tariffs from the G 20  But that was all the good news for stocks  When the closing bell rang on Friday  each of the major indices were down by 4 5  or more for the week 
	The NASDAQ tumbled 3 05   or 219 points  today to 6969 25 with all FAANGs solidly in the red  The Dow slipped 2 24   or 558 points  to 24 388 95  while the S P was off 2 33  to 2633 08 
	The economy added 155 000 jobs in November  which was below expectations of around 200 000  The unemployment rate held steady at 3 7   So the report wasn t  too hot  and  therefore  might help convince the Fed to slow further rate hikes next year  On the other hand  it feeds into growing concerns that the economy is slowing down

169594,391110,LEN,US Housing Market Data,opinion,"Today marks the last major housing data we ll get from the US this year  and given the performance of the markets lately  the state of the US housing market deserves a closer look 
We all remember the subprime mortgage crisis a little over a decade ago  so it s understandable that investors will be a little sensitive to bad data from the US housing market  And  well  there s been plenty to be concerned about  especially with the Fed tightening monetary policy
What s Going On 
Housing is a major factor in the economy  which often isn t appreciated in its differential aspects  Housing  of course  contributes to GDP and is often measured by  residential fixed investment   RFI  which accounts for spending on building and remodeling of homes 
This is about 3 5  of the GDP  so some people feel comfortable dismissing it as a relatively small driver of the economy  On the other hand  consumer spending on housing accounts for a third of the average family lifetime expenditure  Additionally  homeowners acquire an enormous amount of debt 
The issue of debt is the central concern  Since over 70  of homes are bought with debt  fluctuations in interest rates have an impact on homebuyers and owners  It s not just that rising interest rates mean that potential homeowners have to pay more in interest  but it lowers the amount of money they can afford to spend on a house  putting downward pressure on house pricing  and by extension the market 
Market Forces
Many home builders have opted to try to increase the profitability of their investments by pushing to build and sell ever more expensive properties  Indeed  housing price inflation has not only outstripped inflation in the broader economy  but also wage growth 
Post recession  median house prices bottomed out at  148K in March 2012 and have since been climbing at a steady  6 5  annual up to  221 5K at the start of last month   and the expectation is that that they will continue to track a 6 4  growth next year  That s almost double the  3 4  expected real wage growth  in line with the last six months  
On the other hand  the 30 year average mortgage rate has actually fallen to 4 63  since reaching a 7 year peak of 4 94  in mid November  In a similar vein  existing home inventories are at the highest they ve been since May of 2011  when accounting for seasonal variation   with 1 85M homes available for sale 
Mortgage delinquencies continue to be higher than credit cards  even though that gap has been closing since the financial crisis 
Demographics
Part of the upset can be explained by the increase in multi family homes vs  the decrease in single family homes  people moving to cities to live in housing blocks away from single family homes in rural and suburban areas  However  this is still a reflection of increasing house prices  and the market moving towards smaller  more affordable homes  being pressured by increasing land  construction and borrowing costs 
With younger people devoting a larger percentage of their salary to housing  this means they have less disposable income for other products  In that environment  the long term trend of the housing can bleed over to other areas of the economy 
As an echo of this drop in exuberance in the market  the November NAHB Housing Market Index came in line with expectations at 60  the same as the previous month   which had been an unexpected disappointment 
Generally  housing does well in the final few months of the year  but so far it s been shaping up to be somewhat of an exception  Mind you  60 still indicates a positive outlook  just not as positive as before 
Housing Permits and Starts
In those conditions  we ll get November housing data  with stronger data seeing as supportive of the USD  and vice versa 
Housing Permits are expected to grow 0 4  to 1 27M  which would bring it back in line with the results in October  and still part of the downward trend seen since the peak in March of this year 
Housing Starts are expected to drop 0 7  to 1 22M  which would still be above October s level  However  it would also continue the slump seen since the beginning of the year 
Some people have blamed the woes of the housing market on the Fed s rate policy  It should be noted that even though the 30 year fixed rate jumps each time the Fed raises rates  the peak in Housing Starts was reached in April this year when the mortgage rate was at 4 7   Even though the Fed raised rates subsequent to that  these were not translated into major jumps in the mortgage rate  showing people simply opting not to buy 
The segment of the market that has seen significant growth  Rentals  The US has the highest percentage of rentals in fifty years   but home ownership has largely remained stagnant since peaking before the 2008 recession  contrary to public perception  not many people lost homes they lived in during the recession   In other words  a lot of this construction is going into second homes for rental 
On the positive side  US developers like Lennar  NYSE LEN  continue to make record sales  and total mortgage debt is still below 2007 levels  though that s masking the demographic divide  urban housing debt is significantly higher than pre crisis levels while rural debt is still at 80  of pre recession levels  ",2018-12-18,ORBEX,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-housing-market-data-200369085,200369085
169625,391141,LEN,Trend Breaks And A Plunge Worthy Housing Slowdown ,opinion,"I saw a flicker of hope for home builders in the May Housing Market Review  Traders decided to snuff that flicker out very quickly afterward  When I wrote June s housing market review and described a  struggling flicker   the iShares US Home Construction ETF  NYSE ITB  was once again bouncing off the bottom of 2018 s trading range  By the time of the September Housing Market Review  ITB was still holding to its trading range  but weakening housing data made for a precarious outlook  In September  ITB finally broke down and hit a 13 month low  THIS month officially ushered in a complete collapse that was very plunge worthy  So far this month  ITB has lost 13 8  for a 20 month low 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  stabilized this past week for the first time in over a month  The index sits at a 20 month low 
Conditions are getting bad enough to drag out the downgrades from analysts  Almost two weeks ago  Bloomberg reported on three analyst downgrades 

 BTIG analyst Carl Reichardt reduced builder earnings estimates for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years and cut price targets for D R  Horton Inc  and KB Home  on the expectation of lower home orders and profit margins  Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  downgraded Lennar Corp  NYSE LEN   and Meritage to neutral from outperform  and KB Home to underperform from neutral 
Alan Ratner of Zelman   Associates warned investors to  buckle up for a rocky builder earnings season   citing downside risks for many metrics  especially orders  

Interestingly enough  earnings reports last week finally garnered a different response from the market than the strong fades from the past several months  Pulte Home  NYSE PHM  is one of the most encouraging as the stock soared 7 7  post earnings and faders failed to push the stock backward  PHM is still rallying in what looks like a bottoming pattern  PHM closed the week up 14 6  post earnings  but it did not quite break out from its downtrend defined by the lower Bollinger Bands  BBs  

Pulte Home  PHM  bounced sharply off a 21 month low thanks to earnings  Downtrending 50DMA resistance still looms overhead 
Meritage Corporation  NYSE MTH  put on its own display of fireworks with a 9 5  post earnings gain on Thursday  The stock gained another 2 0  on Friday 

Meritage Homes  MTH  broke out of a steep downtrend from its lower Bollinger Bands  BBs  thanks to earnings 
The positive response to earnings was infectious as stocks like KB Home  KBH   Lennar  LEN   and Toll Brothers  TOL  managed to jump off lows and print mini breakouts 

KB Home  KBH  traded above its lower Bollinger Band  BB  channel for the first time in over a month 

Lennar  LEN  experienced a surge in buying volume and ended the week above its downtrending lower Bollinger Bands  BBs   
Toll Brothers  TOL  made a solid break for its downtrending 20DMA 
The bounces in home builders were all the more impressive in the face of heavy selling across the stock market  The relative out performance is encouraging and is a good setup for the November to March period when ITB tends to out perform the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    Still  ITB itself did not quite breakout for the week  so the jury is still out as to whether this move is an overall bottoming or just a fleeting relief rally of short covering and counter trend bets and or misplaced trades on  it cannot get much worse from here  sentiment 
New Residential Construction  Single Family Housing Starts    September  2018 While housing starts surged in May and left no doubt that home builders were confident as ever  the subsequent plunge in housing starts in June appeared to temper that enthusiastic interpretation  Small increases from July through September seem to have stabilized things for now 
Single family housing starts for August were revised significantly upward after two straight months of downward revisions from 862 000 to 879 000  September starts decreased month over month by 0 9  to 871 000  On an annual basis  single family housing starts increased by 4 8   This increase alleviates the weight of the previous three months which delivered two year over year declines  June s year over year decline was the first for housing starts since August  2016  and June s level sits as the lowest of the year  I am still worrying that something important has fundamentally changed in the housing market  These data still look like a breakdown in slow motion with starts riding right at the edge of the post recession uptrend 

Another month with housing starts clinging to the bottom of recent lows 
Source  US  Bureau of the Census  Privately Owned Housing Starts  1 Unit Structures  HOUST1F   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  September 24  2018 
Over the 8 months prior to May  regional year over year changes in starts exhibited wide dispersion  For May  housing starts were very strong across the board  For July and August  the wide dispersion returned  and it continued in September  The Northeast  Midwest  South  and West each changed  25 3   3 2   7 6   and 10 9  respectively  The bump up in July housing starts was less impressive than it appeared given it was mainly driven by the Midwest  For August  only a second month of gains for the West prevented housing starts from looking worse  Finally  in September  the regions delivered solid performances outside of the Northeast  Surprisingly  housing starts did not show the expected decline in September given damages from Hurricane Florence in southern states from Virginia to South Carolina 
Existing Home Sales   September  2018 Existing home sales printed its fifth month over month decline over the last six months  Sales have declined year over year for the last 7 months  Last month  the National Association of Realtors  NAR  chose to celebrate headlines about a stabilization of sales and the end of the decline  but I countered with my skepticism  I think THIS month represents official acknowledgement of a sinking reality 
The path to red alert territory has been slow but noticeable  The February existing sales numbers ended a 2 month sales decline and softened a bit my alarm bells over slowing growth  In March  monthly sales continued to increase  but the year over year change was a decrease  For April  both monthly and year over year changes were declines  May recorded similar declines and put existing home sales right back in  yellow  cautionary territory  The June and July double whammies of monthly and annual declines put existing home sales in  red  territory  August s continuation of year over year declines kept my mental indicator in the red  September delivered another double whammy of declines 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales in September of 5 15M were down 3 4  month over month from the slightly downward revised 5 33M in sales for August  Year over year sales decreased 4 1   Sales are down a whopping 7 4  year over year for the first 9 months of the year and are at their lowest level since November  2015 

The topping pattern in existing home sales was confirmed with a new low in sales for the year   As of the March  2018 data  the NAR further reduced historical data to just 13 months  For historical data from 1999 to 2014  click here  For historical data from 2014 to 2018  click here  Source for chart  National Association of Realtors  Existing Home Sales   EXHOSLUSM495S   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  October 27  2018 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  Sales have not increased for months  so the NAR has bounced around various themes attempting to put the declines in context  For August s data  the NAR chose to emphasize a stabilization in sales after a few months of  drip drip  down  quote from the press conference   During October s press conference  the NAR specifically used the term  soft data  to describe sales activity in terms of foot traffic in previously hot housing markets  from  strong to stable    The NAR also directly blamed a 10 year high in mortgage rates for the sales slowdown 
Perhaps even more importantly  inventory is finally increasing and price appreciation is slowing as the NAR has long coveted  but these dynamics are not accompanied by increasing overall sales of existing homes  The NAR had to concede this time that there is   without a doubt a clear shift in the market   The NAR previously celebrated an increase in inventory as a return of buyers to the market  now  the NAR laments a decline in buyers 
The  cross over  in June when inventory increased year over year for the first time since June  2015 looks like the beginning of a trend  The 1 88M existing homes for sale is down 1 6  from August  but inventory is up 1 1  year over year  On a relative basis  inventory increased month over month and year over year  The 4 4 months of supply is a slight increase from August s 4 3 and the 4 2 a year ago 
The share of sales going to first time buyers continues to just bounce around  This month the share sat at 32   an increase from 31  the previous month  This share was 32  in July  31  in May and June  33  in April  30  in March  29  in February and November was 33   September  2017 was the first time in the previous two years where the share dropped below 30  and has not dropped below since  The NAR took this opportunity to downplay the first buyer share numbers   Despite small month over month increases  the share of first time buyers in the market continues to underwhelm because there are simply not enough listings in their price range  
The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 13  of homes in August  the same as the last three months  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016 
Existing home sales decreased across all four regions  Last month  the NAR s focus on the month over month numbers did not tell the real story of continued decline  This time around the story of decline was unavoidable   the West s third consecutive substantial drop is particularly concerning  especially given the size of the decline  Northeast  5 6   Midwest  1 5   South  0 5   West  12 2  year over year  As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  The year over year price changes for September were again relatively robust  Northeast 4 1   Midwest 1 9   South 3 0   West 4 1   If not for the relatively steady first time homebuyer numbers and on going sales declines in the West  I would have assumed that higher end homes are increasingly dominating existing home sales 
September s 4 2  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 79th consecutive month with a year over year increase  The median price of  258 100 is the third consecutive month over month decline  Given the sales declines  the NAR s earlier optimism over four  now five  straight months of annual price gains below 5  is looking like a  watch what you wish for moment  
Single family sales were down on a monthly basis and decreased on a yearly basis by 4 0   The median price of  260 500 was up 4 6  year over year 


New Residential Sales  Single Family    September  2018 New home sales were resurgent in March  April sales did not keep pace on a monthly basis but delivered a strong year over year performance  In a surprisingly stark contrast to existing home sales  new home sales from May to August increased in each month on a year over year basis  September finally unleashed a  pent up  decline in new home sales commensurate with existing home sales  This decline provided a final confirmation that November  2017 delivered a substantial and sustained peak in new home sales 
The Census Bureau revised August sales of new single family homes significantly downward from 629 000 to 585 000  five of the last six months have delivered sizable downward revisions   yet one more bad sign indicating a slowdown  August s revision was steep but did still preserve a year over year gain for the month  New home sales for September decreased 5 5  month over month and sharply declined 13 2  year over year to 553 000  This decline was the largest since an April  2011 26 5  year over year decline  It was the lowest level of new home sales since December  2016 at 546 000 sales  Year over year gains regularly hit double digits starting in 2012  last November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  With August s downward revision  2018 has yet to deliver a double digit year over year gain  September s large drop sticks out as a sore confirmation that the trend in new home sales has fundamentally changed  Indeed  the graph below makes plain the significant and ominous trend break 

There goes the uptrend  September new home sales sliced right through the post recession uptrend that has long supported the bullish thesis for new home sales  Source  US  Bureau of the Census  New One Family Houses Sold  United States  HSN1F   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  October 27  2018 
 This month I adjusted the discussion of inventory according to current revisions   In December  the inventory of new homes increased to 5 5 months of supply  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  March s inventory stood at 5 3 months  For June  inventory jumped back up to 6 0 months of sales  a perfect balance  Inventory has continued to increase from there  September s inventory surged to 7 1  In September s Housing Market Review I wondered whether new homes might move too far to an over supply condition  sure enough this is exactly what has happened  An over supply of new homes detracts from the abiding optimism expressed by the NAR over higher supplies of existing homes  The swelling supply will also discourage builders from doing the kind of building the NAR wants to see 
May s median price of  316 700  revised  was an actual year over year decline  June delivered a second straight decline  July s prices bounced back  the median price increased 1 6   revised   August s median price of  319 200  revised  was also a year over year increase of 1 6   With sales plunging in September it is no surprise that prices dropped year over year as well  the median declined 3 5   the average declined 0 6   These price declines sit in stark contrast to the persistent increase in price for existing homes 
The Northeast was a notable laggard for the third straight month with a whopping year over year sales decline of 51 3   The Midwest was the only gainer at 4 1   The South dropped 11 4   and the West declined 15 8   The Northeast has been extremely volatile for many months now  The Midwest continued a streak of multi month growth  The declines in the West are now more closely aligning with languishing existing home sales in the West 
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index   October  2018
In the April housing market review  I explained why I would not have thought much of March s slight decline in the Housing Market Index  HMI   At 70  the HMI was still higher than it was for most of 2017  For July  the HMI stayed at 68 for the second straight month  However  the HMI dropped another point in August and stayed at 67 for September  For two straight months  the NAHB cleverly called 67 a  solid reading   I was circumspect about this reading given it was the low for 2018  and I remain so even with the HMI increasing by one point in October  The following quote tells me that the NAHB sees a housing slowdown has begun  emphasis mine  

 Favorable economic conditions and demographic tailwinds should continue to support demand  but housing affordability has become a challenge due to ongoing price and interest rate increases  Unless housing affordability stabilizes  the market risks losing additional momentum as we head into 2019  

Like the aggregate HMI  the components of HMI jumped slightly off recent lows  Two factors previously allayed alarm over the recent low HMIs  1  in 2017 the HMI was also slipping to a low around September  September  2017 was the nadir for last year at 64   2  the  now  68 9 average HMI for 2018 is still higher than 2017 s average of 67 8  September s bounce needs to continue from here  but a strong bounce is not likely given the breakdown in new home sales 
The statement from the NAHB in May was very positive with a big caveat for rising prices  For June  the NAHB made an even bigger issue of lumber prices by shining a spotlight on trade actions that drove those prices higher  For August  the NAHB singled out the drivers of poor affordability  The September statement was one of the stranger ones I have seen from the NAHB  The NAHB finally acknowledged the decline in lumber prices but seemed eager to increase the spotlight on other drivers of poor affordability    builders still need to manage construction costs to keep homes competitively priced  Wages and subcontractor payments continue to rise as the labor market for residential construction sector remains tight   The NAHB later went on to suggest that trade problems are still driving material costs higher   housing affordability is becoming a challenge  as builders face overly burdensome regulations and rising material costs exacerbated by an escalating trade skirmish   For October  the NAHB acknowledged a 3 month decline in lumber prices  but warned about unspecified  supply side costs  still threatening the affordability of homes 

Consumer confidence remains stalled out while the components of the HMI lifted a bit off recent lows  Source  NAHB
As a whole  the regional HMIs confirm the languishing nature of recent HMIs  but each region  woke up  a bit in October  The Northeast continued a recovery with a 4 point gain to 64  The Midwest ended a 4 month losing streak and bounced off a 2 year low with a 2 point gain to 58  The South gained 2 points to 71  The West gained a point to 75 
Needless to say  home builder sentiment will be a key tell in the coming months  In the last Housing Market Review  I concluded that HMI had to begin a recovery in October for me to look forward more optimistically to the seasonally strong period for home builder stocks  November through March April   With HMI just a point off its low  home builder sentiment still looks like a breakdown in slow motion 
Parting thoughts
I was immediately skeptical of the 2013 book  The End of the Suburbs  Where the American Dream Is Moving  by Leigh Gallagher  It was published in the immediate wake of the disruptive forces unleashed by the housing bust  and it seemed too quick to come to conclusions about fundamental changes in the housing preferences of Americans  Work done by economist Jed Kolko suggests that my early skepticism was likely on point  He used Census data to show that as of 2016  Millennials have been moving BACK to the suburbs 

Kolko provides extensive demographic detail in  2016 Population  Back to the Suburbs  Back to the Past   I am not surprised by these findings  primarily because city living has become so incredibly expensive in so many metro areas  It will be interesting to see how a housing slowdown alters these dynamics 
Be careful out there

169626,391142,LEN,Lennar  LEN  Down 1 5  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Lennar  LEN   Shares have lost about 1 5  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Lennar due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Lennar s Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues In LineLennar Corporation s third quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of  1 40 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 19 by 21 cents  The reported figure mainly excludes acquisition and integration costs related to CalAtlantic Group  Inc Including these items as well as backlog construction in progress write up related to purchase accounting  the reported figure came in at  1 37 per share in the quarter  increasing considerably from the year ago profit level of  1 04 per share The improvement was primarily attributable to greater demand  courtesy of strong housing market fundamentals  given low unemployment  higher wages and lower inventory levels Total revenues of  5 67 billion were on par with the consensus mark but increased 74  year over year as the Homebuilding and Financial Services performed significantly well Segment DetailsHomebuilding  The segment s revenues increased 83  from the prior year quarter to  5 28 billion  driven by higher number of homes delivered and greater average selling prices  Within the Homebuilding umbrella  home sales constituted  5 22 billion  up 83 2  year over year  and land sales amounted to  62 million  up from  37 5 million a year ago  New home orders increased 62  from the year ago quarter to 12 319  Potential value of net orders increased 73  year over year to  5 1 billion Home deliveries increased 66  from the prior year quarter to 12 613  buoyed by higher number of homes delivered across all homebuilding segments  courtesy of a significant increase in volume resulting from the CalAtlantic acquisition The average sales price  ASP  of homes delivered was  415 000  reflecting an increase of 10  year over year In the quarter under review  backlog grew 88  from the year ago quarter to 19 220 homes  Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 105  year over year to  8 4 billion MarginsGross margin on home sales was 20 3  in the quarter compared with 22 8  a year ago  Excluding the above mentioned backlog construction in progress write up  gross margin on home sales was 21 9   The decline was due to higher construction and land costs that were partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered As a percentage of home sales  SG A  selling  general and administrative  expenses improved 60 bps to 8 6  from 9 2  a year ago  The improvement was due to improved operating leverage  owing to higher home deliveries  Benefits from technology initiatives also added to the positives Financial Services  Financial Services revenues increased 9 9  to  236 3 million in the quarter  Operating earnings at the segment were  56 6 million  up from  49 1 million a year ago Rialto Investments  Rialto Investments  revenues of  49 5 million decreased from  57 8 million a year ago  The segment reported operating earnings of  9 4 million in the quarter against a loss of  3 2 million in the year ago quarter Lennar Multi Family  Lennar Multi Family revenues of  101 1 million decreased from  103 4 million recorded in the prior year quarter  The segment incurred operating loss of  3 9 million in the quarter versus earnings of  9 1 million a year ago FinancialsLennar Homebuilding s cash and cash equivalents totaled  833 3 million as of Aug 31  2018  down from  2 3 billion on Nov 30  2017  Net homebuilding debt of the company was  8 6 billion as of Aug 31  2018 compared with  4 1 billion on Nov 30  2017 Rialto TransactionLennar remains on track for restructuring and marketing the Rialto platform to gain from potential disposition  Commercial real estate investment  investment management  and finance company Rialto s balance sheet assets have been appropriately segregated to isolate the core asset management business  as Lennar s management had earlier hired investment bankers to begin a process that could maximize the value of that franchise Q4 GuidanceLennar has adjusted both deliveries and new order guidance  in order to primarily reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence and also the sluggishness that it has been currently experiencing in the market The company expects deliveries to be about 14 500  versus prior expectation of 15 000 units  and new orders at 11 400  as against 11

169627,391143,LEN,Berkshire Hathaway  Grubhub  SPDR S P Homebuilders And Invesco Dynamic Building   Construction Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 21  2018    highlights Berkshire Hathaway  as the Bull of the Day  Grubhub   NYSE GRUB   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  and Invesco Dynamic Building   Construction ETF  Here is a synopsis of two stocks and two ETFs   It s no secret that the equity markets have been suffering lately  Investor sentiment has turned broadly negative and in many cases selling seems to beget selling  even when there s no clear catalyst  We ve seen downturns before that were the result of significant contagious events   the Asian Flu  the collapse of Long Term Capital Management  the Bursting of the Tech Bubble and the Financial Crisis of 2008 We haven t seen any compelling reason for the selling pressure of the past two months other than investor fear and the desire to protect the profits accumulated during the previous nine year bull run  In many cases  investors seem to be dumping shares of even the healthiest companies as they race to the door One legendary investor has consistently recognized previous periods of turmoil as opportunities and used temporarily depressed share prices to bolster his portfolio at attractive prices Warren Buffett The Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha has a famous bit of advice about investing    Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful     and he has consistently put his money where his mouth is  making shrewd investments in the strongest companies when sentiment is at its worst Owning shares of Buffett s holding company  Berkshire Hathaway is like getting a ride on the Oracle s coattails as he and his top lieutenant Charlie Munger put their combined 100  years of investing experience to work finding opportunity amid the chaos Berkshire is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Munger coined the phrase  lollapalooza effect  to describe how a confluence of cognitive biases can result in situations in which groups of otherwise well informed people can act irrationally Berkshire has capitalized on the irrational behavior of investors countless times  possibly none more notable than their tremendously successful investment in Goldman Sachsduring the financial crisis in 2008 The contagious effects of falling share prices  loan defaults and huge losses in derivatives trades threatened to bring down the entire investment banking industry Shortly after the fall of Lehman Brothers  Buffett recognized that Goldman was a significantly stronger enterprise than other investment banks  all of whom had seen their share prices pummeled During the height of the panic  Buffett invested  5B in Goldman in a private deal that gave him a large ownership stake in preferred shares that paid a 10  annual dividend as well as warrants to buy an additional 43 million shares of common stock at  115 share  It was a win win situation as Goldman then enjoyed the credibility conferred by Buffett s investment and was able to raise additional capital in an equity offering and ultimately survived the crisis as strong as ever Buffett s profit on the trade is estimated at  3 1B   a fairly tidy return that was made possible only because of his willingness to make a huge bet just as most others were at their most risk averse In the event of any sort of crisis situation in the future  what investor wouldn t want Warren Buffett at the helm  making the tough choices for them Berkshire PortfolioBerkshire tends to take large positions in high quality  large cap names and holds them for long periods of time  often adding to those positions during periods of opportunity Traders comb Berkshire s quarterly SEC filings reporting their holdings and it s not uncommon to see quick appreciation in any given name once the markets recognize that Buffet has spent the previous three months acquiring shares As of the end of the third quarter  Berkshire had approximately  86B   or 40  of its portfolio   in the shares of large banks  including  13B purchased during the quarter  Buffet loves banking and insurance businesses because of the natural spread between taking in deposits or premiums and investing lending at significantly higher rates to make profits  He also favors what he calls  forever businesses  whose products and services are in demand in all economic environments Investment banks also tend to see improved financial results during tumultuous times because of both increased commissions and fees on a higher volume of customer business as well as increased margins on proprietary trading activity  Founded in 2004  Grubhub initially set out to use internet technology to eliminate outdated paper delivery menus for restaurants  allowing customers to quickly update menu choices and prices and reach a wider audience  Grubhub subsequently moved into providing delivery services as well  giving access to a wide range of restaurant choices to consumers who never have to leave home to enjoy their favorite menu items Grubhub now provides delivery services for over 80 000 restaurants in more than 1 600 cities in the US and the UK The company went public in 2014 and had seen shares appreciate as much as 475  from the offering price of  26 share  hitting a high of  149 share in September of 2018  A steep drop since then has Grubhub currently trading around  80 share and there are some dark clouds on the horizon The problem is increased competition in the food delivery space  Though its services have undeniable appeal to consumers and restaurants alike  there are no serious barriers to entry in the industry  Acquiring early brand recognition and a dedicated customer base provided a first mover advantage for Grubhub  but several deep pocketed competitors with experience in transportation now threaten to capture a significant share of the market UberEatsRide sharing behemoth Uber built its business on the concept of utilizing idle assets  Realizing that many automobiles aren t being used at any given time  Uber applied cell phone location and mapping technology to the problem  allowing independent drivers to use their own vehicles to provide rides to strangers for a fee After dominating the market for human passengers  Uber realized that cars on the road without a passenger could also be used to deliver mail order packages and restaurant to go orders  UberEats now delivers restaurant food in much the same way as Grubhub and has become enormously popular  especially with millennials who are already accustomed to using the company s transportation services The website ridesharingforum com recently conducted an experiment in which they ordered identical items using Grubhub  UberEats and a third competitor  DoorDash  They found that the total prices paid and the amount of time it took for the food to be delivered were essentially identical  The only minor differences were in the way the restaurants were compensated for the orders  invisible to the customers  and the method for tipping the drivers  In other words  from a customer perspective  the services are totally fungible  There s no compelling reason to prefer one over the other Uber is not standing still either  Continuing with the theme of using idle capacity  Uber is now a partner in over 1 600  virtual  restaurants in which underutilized kitchen space in existing restaurants is used to produce menu items for restaurants that don t actually exist as physical spaces where customers could go  The restaurant partners get to share some of the cost of rent and labor that would otherwise be wasted and Uber gets to keep part of the menu prices   around 30    as well as the delivery fees Additional content Can Builder Confidence Recover from November s Sharp Plunge The confidence level among the nation s homebuilders plunged eight points in November  the sharpest one month drop since 2014  The November reading is also the lowest since mid 2016 as rising prices and borrowing costs are coming in the way of buyers  affordability  according to the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  Wells Fargo Housing Market Index Following the latest reading  the SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF dropped 0 4   while Invesco Dynamic Building   Construction ETF fell 0 9   Meanwhile  homebuilding stocks have already been thrashed this year in anticipation of slower growth in housing and higher costs for construction companies  The Zacks  industry has lost 34 7  this year  whereas the broader S P 500 Composite market has gained 2 2  Key TakeawaysHomebuilder sentiment fell eight points in November to 60 from October and all three indices   present sales  future sales and buyer traffic   registered a fall  In the words of NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz   While home price growth accommodated increasing construction costs during this period  rising mortgage interest rates in recent months coupled with the cumulative run up in pricing has caused housing demand to stall  Current sales conditions fell seven points to 67  Buyer traffic plunged eight points to 45  the lowest since August 2016  and sales prediction over the next six months dropped 10 points to 65  Regionally  the HMI reading was dismal for South and West  declining 2 points and 3 points to 68 and 71  respectively  However  Northeast and Midwest ended on a positive note  increasing two points and one point  respectively Affordability Taking a Toll on HousingChallenges like inventory shortage are prevailing in the U S  real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country  thereby affecting affordability  In addition to this  rising mortgage rates in recent months has been making the operating backdrop tough for homebuilders According to Freddie Mac s latest Primary Mortgage Market Survey  the 30 year rate remained unchanged from last week  averaging 4 94  for the week ending Nov 15  2018  Notably  this is still an increase from last year s rate of 3 95  and the highest since February 2011 Meanwhile  higher home borrowing rates have kept many potential buyers on the sidelines  Mortgage applications in the United States dropped 3 2  in the week ended Nov 9  after a 4  drop in the previous week  per the report from the Mortgage Bankers Association  Moreover  refinance applications decreased 4 3  and applications to purchase a home fell 2 3  Apart from rising mortgage rates that are expected to pose serious threats to the construction market  higher input costs are also compressing homebuilders  margins at a time when political pundits are seriously considering a national infrastructure revamp Construction material prices increased 7 9  year over year and 0 5  month over month in October  according to an Associated Builders and Contractors   ABC   analysis of information provided by the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  Prices for nonresidential construction inputs also increased 0 5  month over month and more than 8  year over year Is Recovery Due in the Near Term Despite the sharp fall in builders  sentiment  an important economic indicator  the reading remains in the positive territory as any reading above 50 signals improving conditions  Homebuilders indicated continued consumer demand for new homes  That said  the recent market data related to sales  permits  starts and existing home sales revealed a decelerating growth rate  which raised apprehensions about housing recovery  Moreover  labor shortage  trade driven material price increases  limited land availability along with increases in new and existing home sale prices have been making things worse Notably  the Federal Reserve hiked the funds rate for the third time this year in September to 2 2 25  in response to a strong U S  economy and signaled a gradual pace of rate hikes  going forward  It was the eighth hike since late 2015  The central bank maintained its forecast of the fourth rate increase before the year end and three more in 2019 The Fed is expected to raise interest rates in December  However  the recent housing slowdown may influence the extent to which the central bank will actually extend its interest rate hikes since late 2015 Economist Dietz also stated   Recent policy statements on economic conditions have lacked commentary on housing  even as housing affordability has hit a 10 year low   said Dietz Homebuilding biggies  like Lennar  NYSE LEN  and KB Home  have also trimmed their expectations recently  KB Home slashed its guidance for fourth quarter fiscal 2018 revenues and average selling prices  Lennar has also adjusted both deliveries and new order guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  to reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence and the sluggishness that it has been currently experiencing The only thing that is positive for the homebuilding industry is robust economic growth and a solid job market that provide the basis for demand Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here

169648,391164,LEN,Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights  JPMorgan  Wells Fargo  Citigroup  ConAgra And Lennar,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 29  2018   Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says   Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  19  from the same period last year on  8 2  higher revenues  with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double digit earnings growth  Good Start to Q2 Earnings SeasonNote  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  Here are the key points      Early Q2 results have started coming out  with total earnings for the 15 S P 500 members that have reported fiscal May quarter results up  41 7  on  13 2  higher revenues  The proportion of these early reporters beating EPS and revenue estimates is tracking above other recent periods        For the S P 500 index as a whole  total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  19  from the same period last year on  8 2  higher revenues  with 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to have double digit earnings growth      Earnings growth in the last earnings season  20018 Q1  reached its highest level in more than 7 years at  24 5  on  8 7  revenue gains      Q2 estimates moved up modestly since the quarter got underway  in contrast to the very strong positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the start of the Q1 earnings season      Q2 estimates for the Energy  Construction  and Basic Materials sectors went up since the quarter got underway  while estimates for the Consumer Discretionary  Consumer Staples  Autos  and Conglomerate sectors went down      Tech sector earnings are expected to be up  24 1  on  10 7  higher revenues  which would follow  31 1  earnings growth on  13 1  revenue growth in Q1  Finance sector earnings are expected to be up  18 2  from the same period last year on  3 5  higher revenues      Other major sectors with strong expected growth in Q2 include Energy   140  earnings growth   Basic Materials   53 9    Industrial Products   24 6   and Retail   17 9    The Autos and Conglomerates sectors are the only ones expected to have lower Q2 earnings compared to the year earlier level      For the small cap S P 600 index  total Q2 earnings are expected to be up  31  on  9 2  higher revenues  which would follow  27 4  earnings growth on  8 4  revenue growth in 2018 Q1      For full year 2018  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  20 2  on  6 3  higher revenues  For full years 2019 and 2020  total earnings are expected to be up  9 8  and  9 6   respectively  Revenues for the index are expected to be increase by  4 6  in 2019  and  4 5  in 2020      The implied  EPS  for the index  calculated using current 2018 P E of 17 6X and index close  as of June 26th  is  156 26  Using the same methodology  the index  EPS  works out to  171 62 for 2019  P E of 16X  and  188 18 for 2020  P E of 14 6X   The multiples for 2018  2019 and 2020 have been calculated using the index s total market cap and aggregate bottom up earnings for each year    Q2 earnings season Gets UnderwayThe Q2 earnings season will really get going with the July 13th releases from JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC   and Citigroup   NYSE C    But the Q2 earnings season has actually gotten underway already  with today s ConAgra   NYSE C   and Lennar   NYSE LEN   reports part of the 15 S P 500 members that have reported results already All of these early results are from companies with fiscal quarters ending in May  but they form part of our June quarter tally  We will have seen such Q2 results from almost two dozen S P 500 members with fiscal quarters ending in May by the time the big banks come out with results Total earnings for these 15 index members are up  41 7  on  13 2  higher revenues  with 93 3  beating EPS estimates and 80  beating revenue estimates It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this small sample of Q2 results  but two trends nevertheless stand out when we compare the Q2 results from these 15 index members with what these same companies reported in other recent periods Q2Expectations as a WholeTotal Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  19  from the same period last year on  8 2  higher revenues  with double digit earnings growth for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors  including Finance and Technology  This would be the 3rd quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth for the index  a trend that is currently expected to continue in the second half of the year as well Energy sector earnings are expected to more than double from the year earlier level  up  140   Excluding the Energy sector  Total Q2 earnings for the rest of the index would be up  15 6    As you can see  the growth picture remains very strong  even though it is expected to decelerate from Q1 s lofty level  The worrying part isn t the seeming deceleration  but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond  This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U S  dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market s less than enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results Note  Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department  He is an acknowledged earnings

169649,391165,LEN,Homebuilder Shares Dramatically Underperforming,opinion,"Homebuilder shares are down 12  to 23  while the stock market is up 9   Housing data has been miserable 
The Wall Street Journal reports Home Builder Shares Miss Out on Stock Rally

Consumer confidence tracking near 18 year highs  strong corporate earnings and soaring retail sales haven t translated into gains across the housing market something that has kept home builder shares from reclaiming the highs they hit at the start of the year 
Even as the broader stock market has clawed its way back to all time highs  big  publicly traded home builders have lagged behind  with shares of Lennar Corp  NYSE LEN   down 17  this year  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI   losing 12   Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL   down 23  and PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM   shedding 15   In comparison  the S P 500 is up 9  this year 

None of this is surprising given the housing data  Existing home sales are down for the fourth month  New home sales fell 1 7   Mortgage rates are rising and the yield curve is flattening 
The question is  where to from here  
Confidence  So What 

 Confidence is soaring to new heights which makes us bullish on growth and forecasts that this expansion may indeed shatter records for longevity next summer   said Chris Rupkey  chief financial economist at MUFG  in an email   The consumer says the economic times we live in is better than you think  

The obvious problem with the confidence theory is that reality doesn t match  Even with the surge in consumer spending on the heels of tax cuts  it did not translate into home sales 
Why 
Affordability  Wages are not keeping up with inflation  And inflation is way understated because home prices  which have soared are not counted in inflation stats 
It will take a decline in home prices  lumber prices  and fixture prices to fix this problem 
Guess what  If all those happen  consumer confidence will not be so high

169677,391193,LEN,Housing Market  A Fresh Flicker Of Life As Sentiment Makes A Dramatic Shift ,opinion,"The fundamentals have changed little  Sentiment is making a dramatic shift 
The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in April  2018 for March  2018  At the time  I lamented a dissonance of decelerating housing data and diverging home builder stocks  Over a month later  the deceleration is a little less pronounced while the divergence continues  This time around  the divergence is occurring alongside a noticeable shift in sentiment that is lifting the stocks of home builders off recent lows and sending a very select number into key technical breakouts  I marvel at how sharply sentiment can change even as the data show little to no change in the fundamental story  Moreover  the stories from the earnings of home builders have beat a nearly consistent bullish melody for months on end 
To show the growing divergence in home builder stocks  I sequenced the charts below starting from what I think is the best to the least of the bunch  Pulte Homes  PHM  and Meritage Homes  MTH  are clear buys based on the technicals  and I have put them on my list of targets  I already made a fresh move on iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  with a calendar call spread at the  41 strike and the months of July and October  This is a  no regret  position which allows me to profit a small amount if ITB stays within a small range from current levels  I am not expecting the entire index to break free for a challenge of the January high  especially given the seasonally strong period for home builders stocks is over and does not restart until November  If a wholesale rally does develop  then positions in PHM and MTH should be tremendous beneficiaries   Recall that I also singled out PHM as looking particularly strong in the last Housing Market Review  

Pulte Homes  PHM  continues to lead the way  It soared 3 8  on Friday in a move that confirmed support from uptrending 50 and 200DMAs  A challenge of the January high is now in play 

Meritage Homes  MTH  is back in bullish form with a solid 200DMA breakout and fresh 4 month breakout 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  summarizes the breakout underway for home builders  ITB gained 2 4  on Friday and confirmed this weeks 50DMA breakout with a 200DMA breakout on good volume 

Century Communities  CCS  has done a great job holding 200DMA support as it pivots around its 50DMA 

D R  Horton  DHI  is about 10  off the May low  The stock backed down from 200DMA resistance  but at least the stock has confirmed a recovery from the mid May meltdown 

LGI Homes  LGIH  continues its churn below 200DMA resistance despite Friday s 4 3  pop 

Lennar  NYSE LEN  is making halting progress closing the gap from the mid May meltdown  Its downward trending 50DMA still looks like daunting resistance

Existing Home Sales   April  2018
The February existing sales numbers ended a 2 month sales decline and softened a bit my alarm bells  In March  monthly sales continued to increase  but the year over year change was a decrease  For April  both monthly and year over year changes were declines  I am back to a cautious stance on existing home sales 
The routine description for existing sales is usually sales decline because of a shortage of inventory and sales increase in spite of inventory shortages  Per the script  for April  the National Association of Realtors  NAR  emphatically singled out inventory as the market s problem   The root cause of the underperforming sales activity in much of the country so far this year continues to be the utter lack of available listings on the market to meet the strong demand for buying a home inventory shortages are even worse than in recent years  and home prices keep climbing above what many home shoppers are able to afford  
The NAR attributed February s sales gains to a  seasonal  jump in inventory  In the April press conference the NAR noted that new listings were up year over year and optimistically projected that inventory could actually increase in late summer or fall  That optimism went unrewarded in April s data  so I will continue to wait and see 
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales in April of 5 46M was down 2 5  month over month from 5 60M in sales for March  no revision   Year over year sales decreased 1 4  and thus stayed consistent with the current trend of decelerating existing home sales 

Existing home sales came back down for April 
 As of the March  2018 data  the NAR further reduced historical data to just 13 months  For historical data from 1999 to 2014  click here  For historical data from 2014 to 2018  click here Source for chart  National Association of Realtors  Existing Home Sales   EXHOSLUSM495S   retrieved from FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  June 6  2018 
The share of sales going to first time buyers increased to 33   This share was 30  in March  29  in February and November and was 32  a year ago  Recall that September was the first time in two years where the share dropped below 30   The NAR warned in last month s report that  Realtors  in several markets note that entry level homes for first timers are hard to come by  which is contributing to their underperforming share of overall sales to start the year   This second consecutive increase in first timer share somewhat refutes confounds the narrative of relatively poor affordability  First timer share will need to quickly decline again to maintain the narrative  A regional breakdown of the data could also reveal important features of the current trends 
The average share for first time homebuyers for 2016 was 35   The NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers reported an average of 34  for 2017  Investors purchased 15  of homes in April  the same as February and March and a year ago  Investor sales averaged a share of 15  in 2017 and 14  in 2016 
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes fell year over year for the 35th straight month  By contrast  inventory increased from March to April by 9 8   a FOURTH straight monthly increase  The NAR noted in its February press conference that inventory  always  increases after the Christmas holiday  However  I think I was correct in suspecting that this increasing trend looks like more than post holiday effects  The trend is also consistent with the NAR s expectation of a potential inventory inflection point later this year  For contrast  recall that during its June  2017 press conference  the NAR talked about a housing crisis in supply in some housing markets  For now the supply crisis continues to run deep at 4 0 months of supply at the current sales rate  down from 4 2 a year ago  The 1 80M homes for sale represents a 6 3  decrease from the previous April 
The regional story on existing home sales had one bright spot in the South  Northeast  11 0   Midwest  3 0   South 2 2   West  0 8  year over year  As usual  regional sale fluctuations had no relationship to the on going price run ups  Each region once again logged notable to substantial year over year jumps in median prices  Northeast 2 8   Midwest 4 6   South 3 9   West 6 2  
April s 5 3  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home delivered the 74th consecutive month with a year over year increase  The median price of  257 900 is significantly higher than March s  250 400  This is a new record that surpasses the previous record set in August  2017 at  253 500  Surprisingly  the NAR did not acknowledge this record 
Single family sales declined 3 8  on a monthly basis and decreased on a yearly basis by 1 6   The median price of  259 900 was up 5 5  year over year 
During the April press conference  the NAR provided an update on the impact of tax reform on existing home sales  The NAR observed that fewer and fewer people are expressing concern about the limits on the mortgage tax deduction  However  they ARE starting to worry about increasing interest rates  In May s conference call  the NAR pointed out that higher rates do have a real cost impact on top of price increases  the average homeowner s mortgage has gone from  1072 to  1190 per month  an 11  increase  The NAR pointed out that wages have certainly not gone up this much  It was an ominous footnote even though the NAR also pointed out that so far demand remains quite strong 

In February  new home sales barely eked forward  New home sales were resurgent in March  April sales did not keep pace on a monthly basis but delivered a strong year over year performance 
The Census Bureau revised March sales of new single family homes downward from 694 000 to 672 000  ending two straight months of sizable upward revisions  New home sales for April decreased 1 5  month over month and increased 11 6  year over year to 662 000  Year over year gains have regularly hit double digits since 2012  November s 26 6  jump was the highest since February  2015 when new home sales soared 29 8  year over year  April breaks a string of three months of single digit gains which represented a concerning deceleration in new home sales 

For new home sales it is still about an uptrend with plenty of month to month volatility

In December  the inventory of new homes jumped to 5 7 months of supply and ended several months of imbalance  A market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply  February s inventory stood at 5 9 months  March s inventory dropped back to 5 2 months  April s inventory sat at 5 4 months worth of sales 
March s revised median price of  335 400 was a 4 3  year over year gain  The revised average sales price of  366 000 was a 4 8  year over year decline so lower priced new homes well outpaced the sales of high priced new homes  For April  higher priced homes surged back  April median price of  312 400 was a mere 0 4  gain  but the average price soared 11 3  
On a regional basis  new home sales exhibited divergence but was across the board strong  After a string of very strong gains since August  the Northeast finally ran out of gas in January with a 44 2  year over year plunge  For February the Northeast returned to gains with an 8 8  jump only to plunge again 52 5  in March  For April  Northeast scraped out a 5 3  gain  The Midwest soared 26 4   The South gained 6 0  year over year  The West cooled off from January s blistering 33 2  year over year gain to gain 3 1  year over year for February  The West heated up again in March with a 24 7  jump  The West stayed hot in April with an 18 9  gain in sales 
Home Builder Confidence  The Housing Market Index   May  2018
In the previous housing market review  I explained why I would not have thought much of March s slight decline in the Housing Market Index  HMI   At 70  the HMI was still higher than it was for most of 2017  For April  the HMI declined yet again  that time by two points to 68  revised downward by a point   May s HMI popped back up to 70  In March the Traffic of Prospective Buyers dropped from 54 to 51 and reversed all its gains since November  2017  In April  this component held steady while the other two fell  In May  this component sat at 51 yet again  I am assuming the HMI has peaked until later in the year 
The statement from the NAHB was very positive  The only caveat related to prices 

 The solid May report shows that builders are buoyed by growing consumer demand for single family homes  Tight housing inventory  employment gains and demographic tailwinds should continue to boost demand for newly built single family homes  With these fundamentals in place  the housing market should improve at a steady  gradual pace in the months ahead  However  the record high cost of lumber is hurting builders  bottom lines and making it more difficult to produce competitively priced houses for newcomers to the market  


The components of the HMI continue to suggest that overall HMI has topped out for now along with consumer sentiment 
While the overall HMI increased  the South and West HMI s declined by a point  The Midwest was the big winner by rebounding from the March and April  revised  dip  The Northeast stayed flat 
Parting thoughts
My parting thoughts in recent Housing Market Reviews have focused on the financial struggles of home buyers and renters  For this month  I selected a recent story from American Marketplace explaining how young home buyers are finding ways to make things work  Young adults are just as interested in owning a house as previous generations  they are just finding it harder than previous generations to own 

 The homeownership rate among millennials is at roughly 35 percent  which is lower than any other generation of young adults in the last 50 years  There s a common narrative that young people aren t as interested in buying homes  that after watching what happened to their parents during the financial crisis  they ve become wary of homebuying 
But poll after poll   including the Marketplace Edison Research Poll   show that homeownership is as big of a goal for young people as it is for everyone else  It can just be difficult to do

169701,391217,LEN,Holding Critical Support As Bulls Struggles To Reassert Themselves,opinion,"When Lennar  NYSE LEN  reported earnings on April 4th the market s reaction looked just like the refresher the market needed to get housing stocks going again  LEN soared 10 0  on the day  The deal looked sealed when LEN appeared to confirm the surge with another up day  LEN has suffered severe selling pressure ever since 


Lennar  LEN  is trying to stabilize at the September  2017 low after completely erasing its last big breakout 
Sellers took over with a vengeance and LEN has never been the same  Last year s big breakout is completely gone  Down days have generated higher volume than up days  Selling days have delivered greater magnitudes than buying days  It took 6 days to reverse the post earnings rally and break 200DMA support  After another 5 trading days  LEN confirmed its 200DMA as resistance  LEN is now DOWN 9 7  post earnings and down 18 6  year to date 
Given LEN s strong earnings results and near rock bottom    13 8 trailing P E  7 7 forward P E  1 3 price sales  and 1 3 price book   it is clear investors and traders are firmly locked back into a fear that the housing market will collapse at any moment  I think this fear is way overblown  yet  as I have stated before  I am forced to respect the poor technicals  I have shed all but one of my homebuilders 
With this ugly backdrop  I took some interest in Steve Grasso s bullish case for Lennar on CNBC s Fast Money  May 24  2018   The case focused on four bullish points that I wanted to believe  but each one has caveats Grasso failed to cover in the short time he had to make the case 
Point 1  Interest rates are stabilizing   this assumes that the recent pullback in rates has carved out a top  There is no reason to believe that yet  Indeed  I am looking to reload on put options on iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NASDAQ TLT  
Point 2  Investors were  too long  LEN when the company merged with CalAtlantic  Their subsequent selling of the stock has removed a major overhang on LEN and the home builder ETFs  I honestly only understand part of the argument  My mild skepticism comes from seeing how LEN dipped a bit at first on the buyout and then soared as a part of its breakout 
Point 3  Lumber prices have topped out   this assumes the recent 10  pullback is permanent instead of a natural cooling period in a secular bullish trend  Strangely  Grasso concluded his argument by claiming the stock declined throughout the drop in lumber prices 
Point 4  LEN has successfully tested a key support level  see the chart above    this claim is premature given a confirmation of the test requires buyers to prove their strength  For example  a close over a key hurdle might confirm the bottom   54 which is above the last big down day or  56 which is above the declining 50 day moving average  DMA   Given Grasso s upside target is around  60  I understand the eagerness to get in here  Presumably he will lower his risk by placing a tight stop below the recent low 

I REALLY want to latch on to Grasso s bullish thesis  but I see too many untested pivots that even together are not strong enough to overcome all the other reasons I decided to respect the poor technicals in the sector 
I voted no along with 75  of the respondents at the time of writing 
I took some notes from   I found a lot to like and little to concern me  My positive interpretation of the results contributed to my reluctance to give up the home builder trader for this cycle 
Market conditions are as strong as ever

The housing market has been strong and it is continuing to strengthen 
The combination of short supply and strong demand means that  it will still take some years to get the equilibrium  
Entry level demand is very strong  robust    We have our strongest absorptions there and we are able to increase prices there  

Margin Results and Guidance

Operating margins gained 70 basis points year over year and exceeded previous guidance 
Full year gross margins between 21 5  and 22  
Full year operating margins between 12 5  and 13 25  

The Lennar Cash Machine For the rest of 2018  LEN will generate about  2  2 5B in cash from operations   before ancillary businesses  CalAtlantic related costs and debt paydowns  
Tax reform is a  net positive  The stimulative effect of tax reform is good for the economy and by extension housing as well  The doubling of the standard deduction helps renters to build the savings needed for a down payment 
Multi family Mammoth

 As of February 28  we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 82 communities totaling almost 26 000 apartment homes with a total development cost of just over  9 billion  
Assets consist of 29 merchant build communities  over 9000 apartment homes   first multifamily venture of just under 12 000 apartment homes  and a second multifamily venture of about 5000 apartment homes 

The biggest drawback of LEN is its complexity  LEN has a lot of different components  In the latest quarter  LEN released FIVE supplemental schedules on top of the press release to help analysts understand all the moving pieces  So while LEN is a strong builder and very attractively priced  there are several other attractive builders that are simpler to understand and thus easier investments

169702,391218,LEN,Builders  Confidence  Economic Growth Raise Hopes For Housing,opinion,"Although the home sales data is not impressive so far this year  the larger picture is indeed a big success  Homebuilders still expect strong demand for new homes as low unemployment and steady economic growth support Americans  buying power 
Of course  finding buildable lots has been a major challenge in the industry in recent times  which could limit their ability to meet demand  That said  homebuilders are currently well placed  belonging to a top ranked Zacks Industry     suggesting that the market headwinds were unable to take the sheen away from the sector 
There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector for both the short and the long term  Below we discuss a few key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead 
Robust Economic Growth
The U S  economy is anticipated to grow at a 4  annualized rate in the second quarter  per the Atlanta Federal Reserve s GDPNow forecast model showed on May 25  This is quite a sharp increase from 2 3  GDP growth registered in the first quarter of 2018 
Fueled by robust economic growth  Fed policymakers are looking at three rate hikes this year  setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates  Nevertheless  Americans are seeing wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade 
President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Although this may face varied obstacles  we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2018 
This upbeat expectation holds particularly true when one of the nation s key economic drivers  i e  construction activity  is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate  The unemployment rate has fallen to 3 9  in April 2018   the lowest since December 2000 
Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand 
Solid Builders  Confidence 
Builders  confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April  reinstating builders  confidence in the current housing market  Importantly  the reading was above the 50 mark in the first five months of 2018  indicating a favorable outlook  Moreover  this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70 
Notably  the National Association of Home Builders or NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI  includes builder perceptions of current single family home sales  sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers 
Higher Demand  Low Inventory to Boost Prices
Steady economic growth along with favorable demographics and the attractiveness of ownership versus rental are driving demand  Although recent home sales have been volatile month over month  the year over year growth rates are indeed compelling  New home sales were up 11 6  year over year in April 2018 
On the other hand  a shortage in buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is giving a boost to prices and is expected to continue doing so for some time 
The supply of April existing homes decreased 6 3  from the year ago period  It has fallen year over year for 35 consecutive months  As such  it will take only four months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market versus 4 2 months a year ago  according to NAR 
Thanks to low inventory and high demand  median sales price of existing homes increased 5 3  in April 2018 from a year earlier  The median sales price of new homes sold in April was  312 400  0 4  higher from the year ago period 
We believe prices will continue to scale as demand for homes is likely to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment  Improving labor markets  declining unemployment rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices  thereby giving a boost to homebuilders  top line 
For 2018  National Association of Home Builders or NAHB expects continued growth for home construction and remodeling  The home improvement sector should also remain strong given recent home price gain  increases in homeowner wealth and other lifestyle improvements 
Millennials Take Interest
Millennials   those born after 1980   are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section  although many disagree with this view  This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce 
First time buyers comprised 33  of sales in April 2018  which is up from 30  in March but slightly down from 34  a year ago  NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers  released in late 2017  revealed that the annual share of first time buyers was 34  
Boosting Land Bank Amid Rising Costs
U S  homebuilders have been seeking various ways to increase their land holding amid rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market that hinder efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market 
Again  limited capital for land development has left entitled lands in short supply  while growing demand drives land prices  The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of labor  arresting the rapid growth in housing production 
Land development and homebuilding are correlated but fundamentally different operations  Prominent homebuilders are buying out major land developers that will help them address the ongoing issues 
In February 2018  Lennar  LEN  acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc  in a  9 3 billion deal  including debt   which creates one of the country s top homebuilders  Since the closing of the transaction  Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior  100 million synergy savings expectations for fiscal 2018 and is on track to meet  365 million synergies for fiscal 2019 as well 
In February 2017  Lennar acquired Florida based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc   a premier lifestyle community developer and luxury homebuilder of single and multi family homes  to enhance its land holdings 
Meanwhile  in March 2018  M I Homes  Inc   MHO   one of the nation s leading builders of single family homes  closed the acquisition of the residential homebuilding assets and operations of Pinnacle Homes  a homebuilder in the greater Detroit  MI market 
Again  William Lyon Homes  WLH  completed the acquisition of RSI  a Southern California and Texas based homebuilder  and three related real estate assets on Mar 9  2018  This addition spreads the company s footprint in the Inland Empire of California and marks its entry into Texas 
How to Play the Industry
Major homebuilders are well poised on the positive fundamentals of the housing market  Particularly  given the cheap valuation compared with the broader market  this is perhaps the right time to pick a few stocks from the Zacks Homebuilding Industry 
We recommend those that are witnessing positive estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Century Communities  Inc   CCS   M D C  Holdings  Inc   MDC   KB Home  KBH   Meritage Homes Corp   MTH   William Lyon Homes and Beazer Homes USA  Inc   BZH  
Century Communities and M D C  Holdings sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while the rest carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Conclusion
Though homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land labor costs  they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth 
The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels  prevailing economic conditions and interest rates  Although rising interest and mortgage rates  land and labor shortages  and rising material prices raise concerns  the 2018 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market  Investors could also take advantage of the homebuilding sector opportunities in the near term

169703,391219,LEN,These Factors May Pull Down Homebuilding Momentum,opinion,"Undoubtedly  the overall outlook for the U S  housing industry remains positive  with a healthy economy and strong job market helping the demand side of the equation  However  the limited supply of homes for sale is the biggest issue facing the market right now and will prevail in the balance of 2018 
Meanwhile  there are other factors that can deal a fresh blow to the housing industry  The U S  Government s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has spurred concerns among investors about certain U S  sectors  particularly Construction 
Although a healthy job market and an impressive supply demand balance will probably draw buyers  rising interest and mortgage rates    as well as land and labor shortages    raise concerns  as do tedious underwriting standards  Intensifying competition also poses a threat 
It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at the dampeners before investing in this space  Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 
Trump Tariff   Rising Material Costs to Shake the Industry
Construction materials  prices continued to rise in March  after a notable spike in February  Meanwhile  tariffs on steel and other goods could push up construction costs 
According to an Associated Builders and Contractors   ABC   analysis of information provided by the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics   BLS    March construction material prices increased 0 8  month over month  On a year over year basis  the price of construction materials increased 5 8   marking the steepest rise since 2011 
 Prices increased for many items in March  even before tariffs announced for steel  aluminum  and additional items imported from China have taken effect   said Ken Simonson  AGC of America s chief economist 
Notably  in March 2018  U S  President Trump has announced hefty new tariffs for imports of steel  at 25   and 10  for aluminum in an attempt to boost U S  manufacturers  The proposal  which is in sync with Trump s America First policy  however  will hit the Construction sector that accounted for 40  of U S  steel demand in 2017  as per the data provider Statista  
Steel is an integral part of the supply chain and widely used in every part of it  from sourcing raw material to construction and manufacturing activities as well as for freight purposes 
An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for homebuilders already grappling with increased cost thanks the recent imposition of lumber tariff  Notably  in 2017  tariff was imposed on lumber  another major input material in the construction sector  The tariff imposed in retaliation to Canada s restrictions on the import of U S  dairy products  averaged 20 83  on Canadian lumber imports  which are used mostly for home building in the United States 
Association officials warn contractors that the Trump administration s additional proposed tariffs might further increase construction costs  resulting in potential project delays and cancellations 
Labor Land Shortage Continues to Hurt
Apart from the rising material costs  the U S  housing industry is already challenged by a shortage of homes for sale  suitable land and skilled labor  Limited supply of homes for sale has been the biggest issue facing the market and the problem will continue  particularly in the entry level market 
Per a recent report by the National Association of Realtors  NARs   the supply of existing homes in April 2018 decreased 6 3  from April 2017 but increased 9 8  month over month  It has fallen year over year for 35 consecutive months 
As such  it will take only four months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market  according to NAR  Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months  supply for a healthy market  Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well 
Also  the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry  as demand continues to scale up  Rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as these limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortage is resulting in higher wages  while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins 
The impact of labor land shortage is twofold  On the one hand  residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers  On the other hand  to make up for rising labor costs  homebuilders are being compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry level homebuyers  In April  first time buyers comprised 33  of sales  which is down from 34  a year ago but up from 30  in March 
Rising land and labor costs have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp   LEN   PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM    PHM   Toll Brothers Inc   TOL  and others  Lennar  PulteGroup and Toll Brothers carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Fed s Hawkish Stance  Rising Interest Rates   Volatile Mortgage Rates
Minutes from the meeting  which ended May 2 and were released on May 23  reveal that Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June  Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to keep the Fed s benchmark interest rate unchanged  in the range of 1 5  to 1 75  
The Fed last raised interest rates in March  by a quarter of a percentage point  The target range for benchmark short term interest rate stands between 1 5  and 1 75   This was the sixth rate hike undertaken by the Fed since 2015  
The Fed expects to increase interest rates two more times in 2018  Fed officials now project a median federal funds rate of 2 9  by the end of 2019  which indicates three rate hikes in 2019 against two predicted in the last Fed meeting in December 2017  They expect the rate to move up to 3 4  in 2020 from the previous expectation of 3 1  
Meanwhile  mortgage rates  which loosely follow the yield on the 10 year Treasury  started the year at around 4  but began rising thereafter  Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U S  government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed 
The 30 year  fixed rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4 61  for the week ended May 17  2018  the highest level since May 2011  according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac 
The rise in interest rates comes at a time when values of homes are marching up with higher demand and lesser supply  The situation could be detrimental to first time buyers  raising affordability issues  This is evident from the latest report of   unveiling the seasonally adjusted weekly survey for the week ending May 18  2018  
The report stated that total mortgage applications fell by 2 6  from a week earlier  Purchase applications for new loans fell 2  from the previous week  while refinance applications plunged 4   the MBA reported  The refinance index is currently at its lowest level since December 2000 
Speculation of further rate hikes is niggling investors in this space  Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the upcoming rise in mortgage rates given the job market strength  its influence on the industry is undeniable and uncertain 
However  with the Fed announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds  target rate  mortgage rates will probably rise in the balance of 2018 or thereafter  High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes  as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 
Additionally  the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market  Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials 
Rising Prices Hurting Affordability
Rising material prices  along with shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor are creating upward pressure on home prices and hindering a stronger housing recovery 
April s median sales price of existing homes grew 5 3  from the comparable period a year ago to  257 900  marking the 74th straight month of year over year gains  In 2017  prices increased 5 8   rising for the sixth straight year  Additionally  the median sales price of new homes sold in April was  312 400  0 4  higher than a year ago 
Overall  rising prices may keep home buyers at bay with many postponing their search for the time being 
Sales Continue to Falter
Most recent data showed that sales of new U S  single family homes dropped in April after gaining in March  In fact  new home sales faltered in three of the last four months this year  suggesting the travails of the housing market in winning back momentum  Housing starts and building permits also fell 3 7  and 1 8   respectively  in the month 
Sales of newly constructed single family homes  accounting roughly 10  of all U S  home sales  dropped 1 5  in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662 000 units  as per data released on May 23 by the Commerce Department  Meanwhile  sales data for the prior three months was also revised down  The revisions revealed that sales in the first three months of the year were not as strong as earlier reported

169757,391273,LEN,Lennar  LEN  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results  ending Feb 28  before market open on Apr 4 Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14   This Miami based homebuilder  however  surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  the average being 4 2  Notably  Lennar s diversified line of home offerings for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers  and positive housing market fundamentals are favorable for this leading homebuilder in the United States Factors at PlayThe company has been reporting solid top line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon to be reported quarter as well  owing to the strong demand for homes  favorable job market and impressive economic conditions According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the company s Homebuilding segment revenues  comprising almost 88 6  of total revenues  of  2 3 billion are likely to increase from  2 billion in the year ago period but decrease from  3 4 billion reported in the prior quarter  This improvement is expected to be driven by higher average selling prices and the delivery of a significant portion of the backlog  The company expects a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 65 70  for the to be reported quarter  The company s order trend  in units  also remained solid  growing 12  in the last reported quarter and 11  in fiscal 2017 The Financial Services segment is also performing well in tandem with its homebuilding operations and innovating new products such as recently announced creative student loan program  However  the segment is likely to register a significant decline in refinanced volume that impacted 2017  This will likely continue to impact the first half of fiscal 2018  Because of this headwind  first quarter and second quarter are expected to result in lower year over year earnings  The consensus estimate for the segment s revenues of  161 million reflects 19 1  sequential decline  However  it is expected to grow from  148 million recorded in the year ago period While Lennar s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near term revenues and earnings  its ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi Family provide diversification as well as complementary long term growth opportunities On the flip side  Lennar  like other renowned homebuilding companies  has been under pressure owing to rising land and labor costs that are threatening margins  While labor shortages are leading to higher wages  land prices are increasing due to limited availability Lennar s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points  bps  year over year in both the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2017  The decline was primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home  This trend is unlikely to change in the to be reported quarter Nonetheless  Lennar s diligent efforts to improve its operating efficiency via digital marketing efforts  dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives are expected to offset the headwinds  thereby driving growth for this homebuilder  In this regard  the company is working hard to improve its SG A expenses via operating leverage and investments in technology  As a percentage of revenues from home sales  SG A expenses contracted to 9 2  in the fiscal 2017 from 9 4  in the year ago period  due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings is pegged at 82 cents  reflecting an increase of 39  year over year  Meanwhile  the same for revenues is pegged at  2 65 billion  implying 13 5  increase What Does the Zacks Model

169758,391274,LEN,Lennar Options Pricing In Large Post Earnings Move ,opinion,"Home construction company Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  is slated to report fiscal first quarter earnings before the bell tomorrow morning  Lennar stock added close to 50  from its September lows to its record high of  72 17 on Jan  22  before pulling back with the broader stock market  Today  the shares are on pace to close a second straight day beneath their 200 day moving average    something we haven t seen since early 2017    and options traders are bracing for more downside after earnings 
LEN was trading down 0 2  at  56 72  at last check  The  56 level has emerged as a foothold for the shares in 2018  with recent rebound attempts capped by the equity s descending 40 day moving average 
Digging into LEN s earnings history  the housing stock has closed higher the next day in each of the last three quarters    including a 3 7  jump at this time last year  On average  the shares have swung 2 5  in either direction in the session after the company reported  looking back two years  For Wednesday s trading  the options market is pricing in larger than usual 7  one day move  per  
In the options pits  traders are heavily bearish ahead of the company s earnings report  with data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  showing LEN with a 10 day put call volume ratio of 4 00  ranking in the 99th annual percentile  This suggests puts have been purchased over calls at a much faster than usual pace during the past two weeks 
Should the homebuilder report weaker than expected earnings  Lennar stock could be vulnerable to negative analyst attention  Currently  13 of 16 analysts following LEN consider it worthy of a  strong buy  rating  Likewise  the average 12 month price target of  78 11 represents a premium of more than 37  to the equity s current price  leaving the door open for potential price target cuts on an earnings miss ",2018-04-04,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lennar-options-pricing-in-large-postearnings-move-200302864,200302864
169780,391296,LEN,A Busted Seasonal Trade For Home Builders,opinion,"for 2017 2018 showed its first sign of trouble when the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  fell sharply off its 10  year high in January on the same day the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   set a new  and its last  all time high  Almost two weeks later  in early February  the under performance widened and became painfully clear as ITB confirmed a breakdown below its 50 day moving average  DMA   Now a month later  ITB has valiantly pulled off a successful test of support at its 200 day moving average  DMA   Still  with ITB down 8 8  year to date versus the S P 500 s YTD gain of 2 0  as the Spring selling season gets underway  I have concluded the seasonal trade on home builders is all but over for this season 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  pulled off a picture perfect bounce off 200DMA support  Confirmation of support will likely only come with a close above 50DMA resistance 
  I described the poor start to the seasonal trade  Sure enough    I was able to anticipate the poor performance because of the typical pattern of the trade  a strong jump out the gate for the first few months after the season kicks off in November and then a gradual  often choppy  decline or drift into the summer in terms of annualized performance  By the Fall  the seasonal trade loses almost all its gas  ITB s performance peaks between March and April and its performance relative to the S P 500 peaks around the same time  Based on the current performance  this season s trade will perform even worse than the 2015 2016 season but still not quite as poorly as the 2008 2009 season  Through February  the fourth month of the trade   ITB has underperformed the S P 500  SPY  by 25 4 percentage points 
In the charts below  I show 2012 to 2018 for clarity  Readers can refer to the last seasonal analysis for the years 2007 to 2011  The x axis is an index that counts the months in the seasonal trade which starts in November  month number 1  The y axis is the difference in annualized performance in percentages between ITB and the S P 500  SPY   Each colored line is a different season  For example  the line for 2012 measures the November  2011 to October  2012 season  or 2011 2012  

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  is severely underperforming the S P 500  SPY  for the season 
For perspective  I post below the seasonal performance of ITB on its own  Note that three other seasons have performed worse than 2017 2018 at this point in the cycle  2007 2008  2008 2009  and 2015 2016  This is awful company  With performance typically peaking in the next 30 to 60 days  ITB is not likely to do much better for most of the rest of the year 

The iShares US Home Construction ETF  ITB  performed worse at this point in the cycle in 2016 
The busted seasonal trade hangs my last tranche of related positions out to dry  I will ride out what is left of the bounce from 200DMA support  but I will officially bring most of the trades to an end if  when   ITB confirms a 200DMA breakdown  This bust also coincides with a February Housing Market Review that flagged some warning signs  so I am eagerly awaiting March s round of data  
For reference the following home builders bounced off 200DMA support alongside ITB  D R  Horton  NYSE DHI   Lennar  NYSE LEN   Pulte Home  NYSE PHM   Toll Brothers  NYSE TOL   and Tri Pointe Group  NYSE TPH

169783,391299,LEN,Lennar Vs  D R  Horton  Which Makes A Better Housing Pick ,opinion,U S  homebuilding was quite a rage in 2017  giving investors ample scope to rake in handsome gains  The industry is equally attractive this year  courtesy of solid economic growth and job market  Consistent job growth  growing interest from first time homebuyers as well as high homebuilder confidence are adding to the momentum  Reflecting the positives  total earnings for the construction sector are expected to grow 33 4  in 2018 from the same period last year on 12 6  higher revenues Meanwhile  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are keeping homebuilders from responding to rising demand to some extent  Despite these challenges  notable homebuilders like PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM    Toll Brothers  Inc    NYSE TOL    Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   and D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   have been consistently performing well Among the industry bellwethers  Lennar and D R  Horton are the most prominent ones  Despite the companies having strong business lines and solid prospects  Lennar   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock   appears to be comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  D R  Horton  You can see  Before drawing a head to head comparison between Lennar and D R  Horton  let s check out a few key statistics of the companies What Defines the Housing Giants D R  Horton  with a market cap of  18 9 billion  offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi brand platform  Moreover  the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market D R  Horton is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets  In October 2017  the company acquired a 75  stake in Forestar Group  a residential and mixed use real estate development company  for  558 million  The deal will help D R  Horton expand operations in Texas   an area which has been witnessing positive housing momentum of late  It is also expected to contribute around  1 billion to D R  Horton s annual revenues over the next five years With a market cap of  14 4 billion  Lennar offers a wide range of homes for first time  move up and active adult buyers  While Lennar s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near term revenues and earnings  its ancillary businesses like Rialto  Multi Family provide diversification as well as complementary long term growth opportunities In February  Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc  for  9 3 billion  including debt  which will create one of the country s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U S  markets Price PerformanceComing to price performance over the last six months  Lennar has gained 18   compared with the broader  s 13 1   Meanwhile  D R  Horton has rallied 20 4  over the period  exceeding both Lennar s and the broader industry s performance  Prospects  Estimates Revisions  Earnings HistoryThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies  Analysts expect D R  Horton to grow earnings at a 10  rate over the next three to five years  Comparatively  Lennar s earnings are expected to grow 18 3  over the same time frame  Hence  Lennar s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation For the near term  the expected current year earnings growth rate for D R  Horton stands at 30 7  compared with 38 9  for Lennar Over the past 30 days  Lennar s earnings estimates for the current year edged up 0 8  to  5 29 per share  Meanwhile  D R  Horton s estimates for the current year have increased 0 3  to  3 58 D R  Horton s projected sales growth for the current year is 14 8   better than Lennar s average of 12 7  Hence  Lennar is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectations Meanwhile  considering a more comprehensive earnings history  D R  Horton has delivered positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters  However  Lennar has surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters  D R  Horton has a slightly superior average earnings surprise of 5 8  compared with Lennar s 4 2  Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company s business and its growth opportunities  Return on Capital  ROC  of Lennar is 6 90   while D R  Horton has a ROC of 10 5   The interpretation is that D R  Horton s business generates a higher return on investment than Lennar s Again  Return on Equity  ROE  is a measure of a company s efficiency in utilizing shareholders  funds  ROE for the trailing 12 months for Lennar and D R  Horton is 12  and 14 8   respectively  While both the stocks have scored above the industry level of 11 8   D R  Horton has an edge here ValuationBoth the stocks are a little overvalued as is evident from their unfavorable P E  P B and P S ratios compared to the homebuilding industry The trailing 12 month price to earnings  P E  multiple for Lennar and D R  Horton are 15 7 and 15 2  respectively  while the industry s is 14 7  D R  Horton s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Lennar Again  trailing 12 month price to book  P B  multiple for Lennar is 1 82  compared with 2 09 for D R  Horton  The industry s P B is 1 79 Trailing 12 month price to sales  P S  multiples for Lennar and D R  Horton are 1 14 and 1 18  respectively  compared with the industry s 1 05 Lennar is cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock  investors use beta  Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole  Conversely  a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk  Lennar has a beta of 1 31 while D R  Horton s beta is 1 20  D R  Horton s shares are therefore less volatile than that of Lennar Bottom LineLennar beats D R  Horton in terms of earnings growth expectation and valuation  while the latter enjoys an advantage in terms of market cap  revenue expectation and returns Both the companies remain positive

The industry advanced almost 69  in 2017  outperforming the broader market s  S P 500  growth of 19 7   Moreover  January 2018 builders  confidence reading remained in the 70s  signaling that housing demand should continue to grow this year  courtesy of healthy demand and strong economic growth Again  there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials  a generation that had  to some extent  refrained some from entering the market For that matter  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector for both the short and the long term  Below we discuss a few key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead Robust Economic GrowthThe nation s Gross Domestic Product  GDP  grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 6  in the fourth quarter of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3   per the  advance  estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  This marked the economy s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid 2009 Consumer spending  the main engine of the economy  grew 3 8  over the quarter after a 2 2  gain in the third quarter  Fueled by robust economic growth  Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes this year  setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates  Nevertheless  Americans are getting heavier pays now  with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade  President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Although this may face varied obstacles  we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2018 This upbeat expectation holds particularly true when one of the nation s key economic drivers  i e  construction activity  is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate  General unemployment rates in America have stayed at a 17 year low of 4 1  for the fourth straight month  with around 200 000 jobs added in January 2018 Construction is one of the sectors that has been providing good employment opportunities  along with other sectors like food services and drinking places  health care and manufacturing  Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand Higher Demand  Low Inventory to Boost PriceSteady economic growth along with favorable demographics and the attractiveness of ownership versus rental are driving demand  Per the National Association of Realtors or NAR  existing home sales witnessed 1 1  increase to 5 51 million units  the highest since 2006 On the other hand  a shortage in buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is giving a boost to prices and is expected to continue doing so for some time The supply of December existing homes decreased 11 4  from November and 10 3  from the year ago period  It has fallen year over year for 31 consecutive months  As such  it will take only 3 2 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market  according to NAR Thanks to low inventory and high demand  median sales price of existing homes increased 5 8  in 2017 from a year earlier  The median sales price of new homes sold in 2017 was  321 100  4 3  higher than 2016  
We believe prices will continue to scale as demand for homes is likely to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment  Improving labor markets  declining unemployment rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices  thereby giving a boost to homebuilders  top line For 2018  National Association of Home Builders or NAHB expects continued growth for home construction and remodeling  The home improvement sector should also remain strong given recent home price gain  increases in homeowner wealth and other lifestyle improvements Millennials Take InterestMillennials   those born after 1980   are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section  although many disagree with this view  This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce First time buyers comprised 32  of sales in December 2017  which is up from 29  in November and unchanged from a year ago  NAR s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers  released in late 2017  revealed that the annual share of first time buyers was 34  Boosting Land Bank Amid Rising CostsU S  homebuilders have been seeking various ways to increase their land holding amid rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market that hinder efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market  
Again  limited capital for land development has left entitled lands in short supply  while growing demand drives land prices  The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of labor  arresting the rapid growth in housing production Land development and homebuilding are correlated but fundamentally different operations  Prominent homebuilders are buying out major land developers that will help them address the ongoing issues In Oct 2017  Lennar Corp   LEN  agreed to take over CalAtlantic Group Inc   CAA  in a  9 3 billion deal  including debt   which will create one of the country s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U S  markets  CalAtlantic investors would own approximately 26  of the combined entity upon the deal s expected closing in February 2018  The combined company will have a footprint touching approximately 50  of the U S  population and the combined entity is expected to generate meaningful cost savings The deal is expected to generate roughly  250 million in annual cost savings  with about  75 million in savings expected in fiscal 2018  The savings include lower overhead costs and elimination of duplicative corporate expenses  Earlier  in February 2017  Lennar acquired Florida based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc   a premier lifestyle community developer and luxury homebuilder of single and multi family homes  to enhance its land holdings Again  in Oct 2017  D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  acquired 75  share of Forestar Group Inc   FOR   a residential and mixed use real estate development company  for about  520 million in cash  This buyout will give a meaningful percentage boost to D R  Horton s current holdings of 252 000 lots  owned and under control   as of June 2017  The company is on track to close 45 800 to 46 200 homes in fiscal 2017 The deal would add to D R  Horton s fiscal 2018 earnings  The Forestar integration is in sync with D R  Horton s long term strategy of developing strong relationship with land developers across the country and growing the optioned portion of its land and lot position to enhance both operational efficiency and returns How to Play the IndustryMajor homebuilders are well poised on the positive fundamentals of the housing market  Particularly  given the cheap valuation compared with the broader market  this is perhaps the right time to pick a few stocks from the Zacks Homebuilding Industry We recommend those that are witnessing positive estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   CalAtlantic  Century Communities  Inc   CCS   M D C  Holdings  Inc   MDC   D R  Horton  Taylor Morrison Home Corporation  TMHC   KB Home  KBH   Lennar  M I Homes  Inc   MHO   Meritage Homes Corporation  MTH   NVR Inc   NVR   Persimmon  LON PSN  Plc  PSMMY  and TRI Pointe Group  Inc   TPH  CalAtlantic  Century Communities  M D C  Holdings  D R  Horton and Taylor Morrison sport a Zacks Rank  1  while the rest carry a Zacks Rank  2  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here ConclusionThough homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land labor costs  they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels  prevailing economic conditions and interest rates  Although rising interest and mortgage rates  land and labor shortages  and rising material prices raise concerns  the 2018 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market  Investors could also take advantage of the homebuilding sector opportunities in the near term Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now ",2018-02-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-far-will-economic--wage-growth-push-housing-demand-200288230,200288230

169843,391359,LEN,Lennar Rides On Strong Housing Demand  Rising Costs A Woe,opinion,Lennar Corporation s   NYSE LEN   diversified line of home offerings for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers and positive housing market fundamental are the driving factors for this leading homebuilder in the United States However  labor shortage along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the company s margins Last quarter  the company s earnings and revenues surpassed expectations on for the seventh time in a row  Its third quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of  1 06 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  the bottom line improved 5  from  1 01 reported a year ago   Solid demand for homes  favorable job market and interest rates along with increased consumer confidence helped the homebuilder post higher numbers Total revenues of  3 26 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 22 billion by 1 3   The top line also grew 15  year over year as the homebuilding  financial services and multi family segments performed significantly well Key Growth DriversLennar is one of the well positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery driven by diverse revenue mix  steady top line performance  above average order growth and improving SG A leverage The company offers a diversified line of homes for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers  Additionally  it regularly upgrades homes to cater to the changing consumer requirements  For example  it introduced NextGen homes  or a home within a home  to allow the homebuyers   who need to accommodate children and parents   to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses Meanwhile  Lennar s continued focus on digital marketing is driving traffic to its communities  Also  the company uses various technology initiatives to improve its operating model  In this regard  Lennar s dynamic pricing tool seems to be quite successful Furthermore  Lennar s ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi Family provide diversification as well as complementary long term growth opportunities  Notably  Rialto is a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals and an important contributor to cash flow These initiatives have helped Lennar to deliver stellar performances  Evidently  the company s total revenues grew 17  year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 on the back of a solid 28 3  rise in homebuilding revenues  The top line was primarily driven by a 13  increase in the number of home deliveries and a 3  rise in the average sales price of the homes delivered  In the meantime  Lennar s core homebuilding results remain consistent with the slow and steady housing recovery Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG A line from operating leverage and investments in technology  In sync with this  it plans to reduce SG A expenses in the range of 8 5 8 6  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  The company maintained its 7  to 10  growth target and is focused on driving operating costs down  in order to drive bottom line and cash flow Moreover  Lennar has agreed to take over CalAtlantic Group Inc    NYSE CAA   in a deal worth  9 3 billion  including debt  announced on Oct 31  This  in turn  might make Lennar one of the country s top three home builders among 24 of the top 30 U S  markets  The combined entity will have a footprint touching approximately 50  of the U S  population and is expected to generate meaningful cost savings  The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  While labor shortages are leading to higher wages  land prices are inflating due to limited availability  Going ahead  more inflation is anticipated that might dent homebuilders  margins  In the first nine months of fiscal 2017  Lennar s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points year over year  primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home So far this year  Lennar s shares have gained 44 8  compared with 64 6  growth of the   Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 have remained stable in the past 30 days Nonetheless  we expect this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company to outperform in the near term owing to the synergies arising out of the CalAtlantic buyout  You can see  Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may also consider stocks like NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR   and D R  Horton  Inc    NYSE DHI   NVR sports a Zacks Rank  1 and is

the above discussed factors that the positive momentum of the constructions sector is likely to continue in 2018 The improvement in the construction sector s Zacks Rank is reflective of the trend  The

169870,391386,LEN,Should Value Investors Pick Lennar  LEN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lennar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Lennar s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Lennar has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lennar stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lennar has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  LEN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lennar currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lennar a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Lennar might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives LEN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimates to go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 18 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone lower by 6 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lennar Corporation Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLennar is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 29  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular

169872,391388,LEN,What Lies Ahead For Housing ETFs ,opinion,"The U S  housing homebuilding outlook remains upbeat for the balance of 2017 and 2018 courtesy of historically low mortgage rates  solid economic growth and tight inventory  Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders  confidence is adding to the momentum 
What Numbers Have to Say
After few months of weak show  existing as well as new home sales regained its charm  surging 0 7  and 18 9  month over month in September 2017  respectively  In fact  sales of new U S  single family homes hit the highest level in nearly 10 years after reporting a slump in recent months  Sales soared 17  on a year over year basis in September  per the recently released report by the Commerce Department 
Again  U S  homebuilders are feeling optimistic despite the recent slowdown in new home sales and the risk of rising labor and materials costs following hurricanes Harvey and Irma  The National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released last month rose four points to 68 in October  marking the highest reading since May 
Hang Ups
Earlier this year  the homebuilding industry saw the fastest quarterly home sales in a decade and lent some much needed support to the economy  The solid sales pace was especially appreciable considering higher prices and mortgage rates 
That said  a tight labor market  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand  Despite concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  optimism surrounding the housing market remains unruffled  Again  with demand outstripping supply  house prices remain elevated  thereby threatening affordability 
The median existing home price for all housing types in September was  245 100  up 4 2  from September 2016  September s price increase marks the 67th straight month of year over year gains  The median sale price was  319 700 for new homes compared with  314 700 in the year ago period 
Although homebuilders acknowledge the rise in labor shortage and land labor cost  they in general expect the housing market to continue to recover this year in tandem with steady economic growth 
Per the National Association of Realtors  recently released report  existing home sales  which account for the bulk of purchases will finish at a pace of 5 47 million in 2017  This is expected to be the best since 2006  6 47 million   but only shows a 0 4  increase from 2016  5 45 million   In 2018  sales are expected to grow 3 7  to 5 67 million  The median existing home price is expected to rise around 5 5  both for this year and the next 
ETFs to Tap the Sector
We take a look at three construction ETFs that are poised to gain from the upswing in the housing market   See all industrials ETFs  
SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF   
The fund employs a replication strategy in seeking to track the performance of the S P Homebuilders Select Industry Index  which is an equal weighted index of the homebuilding segment of a U S  total market composite index  The fund has an expense ratio   an annual fee   of 0 35  
The top three industries are Homebuilding  37 2    Building Products  27 5   and Home furnishing  9 6    The top three holdings are D R  Horton Inc   5 5    PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM    5 2   and Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  Class A  4 9    This fund holds 36 stocks with about 46 8  invested in the top 10 holdings 
iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   
ITB tracks the Dow Jones U S  Select Home Construction Index  which measures the performance of the U S  home construction sector 
The top three holdings are D R  Horton Inc   13 3    Lennar Corp   9 9   and NVR Inc   9 7    The fund is heavily exposed to the Homebuilding sector  68 4    followed by Building Products  13 8   and Home Improvement Retail  7 9   
This fund holds 47 securities in its basket and has an expense ratio of 0 43  
PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Fund   
PKB seeks to match the performance of Dynamic Building   Construction IntellidexSM Index  which is composed of U S  building and construction companies  The top three sector allocations are Consumer Discretionary  47 9    Industrials  33 2   and Materials  13 9    Yet  the fund is more expensive than many other options in the space  charging 63 basis points in annual fees 
Among the 30 stocks in the basket  D R  Horton  PulteGroup and NVR  hold the top spots with 5 7   5 4  and 5 3   respectively  of total net assets  
To Sum Up
Investors  sentiments could be dampened by the possibility of an interest rate hike  Also  skilled labor shortage is a cause for concern as demand continues to rise  Rising land and labor costs too are restricting margins as these limit homebuilders  pricing power 
However  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and the long terms  In this context  the above mentioned ETFs might be sound bets to play the sector Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox Zacks  free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis  as well as top performing ETFs  each week ",2017-11-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-lies-ahead-for-housing-etfs-200267363,200267363
169886,391402,LEN,Housing Industry Stock Outlook   October 2017,opinion,"For the rest of 2017 and 2018  the homebuilding outlook is quite compelling given historically low mortgage rates  solid economic growth and tight inventory  Consistent job growth as well as seemingly high homebuilders  confidence are adding to the momentum Yet a tight labor market  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting the ability of homebuilders to respond to growing demand  Meanwhile  Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August  and Hurricane Irma lashed Florida in early September  
The two devastating storms have created uncertainty for builders  Despite hurricane related effects and concerns over the chance of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  optimism surrounding the housing market remains unruffled Delving DeeperExisting home sales declined to a one year low in August  per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB  Existing home sales slipped 1 7  last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 35 million  This marks the fourth decline in five months  bringing the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months  Purchases in Houston dropped 25  year over year  and sales would have been flat excluding the Harvey impact Economists are of the opinion that diminishing data reflects inventory shortage prevailing in the U S  real estate market  This has pushed up average home prices nationwide  In fact  median sales price of existing homes rose 5 6  last month from a year earlier  
Moreover  total housing inventory declined 6 5  year over year to 1 88 million  marking the 27th consecutive year over year decline  That s only 4 5 month s supply  Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months of supply for a healthy market August new home sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 560 000  per the latest report from the Commerce Department   the lowest annual rate since December 2016  This was 3 4  lower than a month ago and 1 2  lower than the August 2016 level  The median sales price of new homes sold in August was  300 200  0 4  higher than a year ago Adding to the woes  housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 18 million last month  This is 0 8  down from a revised July estimate of 1 19 million  Nevertheless  August construction starts were 1 4  higher year over year  Single family starts were even stronger  growing 17 1  from a year earlier Meanwhile  building permits  another economic indicator used to determine the health of the housing sector  increased sharply by 5 7  from the previous month with 1 3 million authorizations  Last month s permit total was also 8 3  above the August 2016 level of 1 2 million  According to the Census Bureau data  the areas in Texas and Florida that were devastated by the storms accounted for about 13  of permits issued in the country last year Investors should note that housing starts  permits and completions dropped 4 8   4 1  and 6 2   respectively  in July  New U S  single family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9 4  in July  the lowest level since December 2016 Reaffirming a Positive OutlookIt goes without saying that the latest July August housing data has been dismal  Also  the supply situation in the housing sector will remain an issue in the coming months especially in the hurricane affected areas where focus will be more on rebuilding rather than on constructing new homes Nonetheless  homebuilders remain optimistic given strong economic growth and labor market conditions  and expect post disaster rebuilding efforts to drive demand for new homes next year  Again  demand in the homebuilding industry has been strong and is expected to continue so in the remainder of 2017 and in 2018  Strong employment  income growth  growing interest from first time homebuyers  relatively low mortgage interest rates and low inventory of new and existing homes are some of the factors that have been supporting sustained growth in housing demand As the economy plays an important role in the industry it is important to note that the U S  economy grew faster than anticipated in the second quarter  fastest pace in more than two years  and shows a significant jump from the first quarter s lackluster 1 2  growth  The economy grew at an annual rate of 3 1  in the April June period  the Commerce Department said in its third estimate on Sep 28  Along with this  solid homebuilders  confidence  64 in September  raises optimism about the entire construction sector This is clearly evident from the Zacks Homebuilding Industry s year to date rally of 40 5  versus the 13 7  gain of the S P 500 SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  XHB  and iShares U S  Home Construction ETF  ITB   the two largest exchange traded funds focusing on homebuilders and related fare  have rallied 19 6  and 36 1   respectively  year to date Let s take a look at why it s worth paying more premium for the stocks in the industry Homebuilding Industry Offers More UpsideBecause of homebuilders  asset driven nature  it makes sense to value these based on price to book ratio  The valuation of the industry looks attractive at present  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month P B ratio of 1 83  This is quite cheap when compared with the market at large  as the current P B for the S P 500 is 3 79  Its lower than market positioning calls for upside in the quarters ahead Zacks Industry Rank   PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification

169887,391403,LEN,Will Economic Growth  Job Creation Support Housing Stocks ,opinion,"Housing data for the July August period indeed showed dismal growth  Two devastating hurricanes  Harvey and Irma  along with the ongoing higher labor and material costs have been hitting the homebuilding industry hard of late  Also  inventory shortages have started taking their toll on sales pacing 
Nevertheless  overall housing got off to a good start this year and the trend is expected to continue through next year  courtesy of healthy demand  strong economic growth  historically low mortgage rates  escalating rent costs and easy availability of loans  Again  there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials  a generation that had  to some extent  refrained some from entering the market 
For that matter  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector for both the short and the long term 
Below we discuss some of the key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead 
Robust Economic Growth
Gross Domestic Product  GDP  surged in the second quarter  more than doubling the growth seen in the first quarter this year  GDP increased at a 3 1  annual rate in the April June period  the Commerce Department said in its third and the final estimate on Sep 28  This is the quickest growth since the first quarter of 2015 
President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Although this may face varied obstacles  we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2017 
Along with strong economic growth  the labor market helped the industry to maintain its stature  Although the unemployment rate was weak in September in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey and Irma  economists are expecting the numbers to rebound in the coming months and the economy to continue growing 
Average hourly wages rose 2 9  from a year ago  Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides the basis for stronger demand 
Higher Demand  Low Inventory to Boost Price
Steady economic growth along with favorable demographics  historically low interest rates and the attractiveness of owning versus rent are driving demand  The July August housing data may have been weak due to Hurricane Harvey or Irma and the sales pace is expected to remain subdued through 2017 in the Houston area  as well as in parts of Florida 
Nevertheless  re building efforts and lost activity are expected to show up in 2018  As the hurricane ravaged communities rebuild  activity could pick up  giving way to improving demand later this year and into the next 
Per the National Association of Realtors or NAR  total existing home sales  which include both single family and condos  fell 1 7  sequentially to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5 35 million in August  That said  total existing home sales increased 0 2  year over year 
On the other hand  a shortage in buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is boosting prices and is expected to continue doing so for some time 
At the end of August  there were 1 88 million existing homes available for sale  which was down 6 5  year over year  as per data released by the NAR  The reported figure has fallen for 27 consecutive months  The average supply during the month was 4 2 months  showing a decrease from 4 5 months a year ago 
Thanks to low inventory and high demand  median sales price of existing homes rose 5 6  in August from a year earlier  We believe prices will continue to scale despite recent decelerating sales growth as demand for homes is likely to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment  Improving labor markets  declining unemployment rates  low mortgage rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices  thereby boosting homebuilders  top line

Millennials    those born after 1980    are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section  although many disagree with this view  This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce 
According to the 2017 National Association of Realtors Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends study  millennials account for 34  of all buyers and make up for the largest share of home buyers 
Boosting Land Bank Amid Rising Costs
U S  homebuilders have been seeking various ways to increase their land holding amid rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market that hinder efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market  Again  limited capital for land development has left entitled lands in short supply while growing demand drives land prices  The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of labor  arresting the rapid growth in housing production 
Land development and homebuilding are correlated but fundamentally different operations  Prominent homebuilders are buying out major land developers that will help them to address the ongoing issues  In Oct 2017  D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  acquired 75  share of Forestar Group Inc   FOR   a residential and mixed use real estate development company  for about  520 million in cash 
This buyout will give a meaningful percentage boost to D R  Horton s current holdings of 252 000 lots  owned and under control   as of June 2017  The company is on track to close 45 800 to 46 200 homes in fiscal 2017  The deal would add to D R  Horton s fiscal 2018 earnings 
The Forestar integration is in sync with D R  Horton s long term strategy of developing strong relationship with land developers across the country and growing the optioned portion of its land and lot position to enhance both operational efficiency and returns 
Another homebuilding company  Lennar Corp   LEN   acquired Florida based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc   a premier lifestyle community developer and luxury homebuilder of single and multi family homes  in February 2017 to enhance its land holdings 
Low Mortgage Rates Make Homes Affordable
High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers buyers  purchasing power and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 
According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate ticked up to 3 85  for the week ending Oct 5  2017 from 3 83  a week ago  Nonetheless  that was below the roughly 4  rate seen at the start of 2017  Although the upsurge in rates has stalled refinance activity for the time being  mortgage rates are likely to be lower in the coming weeks 
Even if mortgage interest rates rise with the Fed probably announcing further federal fund rate hikes later this year and the next  the rates should remain reasonable  in our view  keeping housing affordable  Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a net positive for the housing sector 
How to Play the Industry
Major homebuilders  like Lennar  D R  Horton  PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   Inc   PHM   KB Home  KBH   Toll Brothers Inc   TOL   to name a few  are well poised on the positive fundamentals of the housing market  Particularly  given the cheap valuation compared with the broader market  this is perhaps the right time to pick a few stocks from the   We recommend those that are witnessing positive estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
One such company is Persimmon  LON PSN  Plc  PSMMY   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1 and advanced 62 1  year to date  The stock has seen a 16 8  upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year  over the last 90 days 
KB Home  a Zacks Rank  2 stock  has gained 64  in the period  Its earnings estimate has improved by 2 4  and 2 9  for 2017 and 2018  respectively  in the last 30 days  The company has solid expected earnings growth of 54 9  for the current year and 21 9  for the next  Also  the stock surpassed earnings estimates by an average 12 67  over the trailing four quarters 
M D C  Holdings  Inc  s  MDC  shares have climbed 45  so far this year and carries a Zacks Rank  2  Although  the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year being marginally revised downward in the last 30 days  2018 earnings estimate revisions have been trending upward  5 6  over the last 30 days   The company has solid expected earnings growth of 67 3  for 2018

Conclusion
Though homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land labor costs  they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth 
The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels  prevailing economic conditions and interest rates  Although rising interest and mortgage rates  land and labor shortages  and rising material prices raise concerns  the 2017 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market  Investors could also take advantage of the homebuilding sector opportunities in the near term 
Check out our latest    here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now

169888,391404,LEN,Housing Losing Ground On Limited Land Supply  Rising Prices,opinion,"Undoubtedly  the overall outlook for the U S  housing industry remains positive  with a healthy economy  strong job market and historically low mortgage rates  However  we cannot ignore that sales are decelerating in recent times  and U S  homebuilders are not feeling quite so optimistic about their sales prospects 
What is plaguing the industry of late is the inventory shortage that is prevailing in the U S  real estate market and the upward pressure it is creating on prices in several parts of the country  Meanwhile  Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in late August 2017  and Irma lashed Florida in early September 2017  The two devastating hurricanes have also created uncertainty for builders 
A healthy job market and an impressive supply demand balance will probably draw buyers  but there are other factors that can deal a fresh blow to the housing industry  Rising interest and mortgage rates  as well as land and labor shortages  raise concerns  as do tedious underwriting standards  Intensifying competition also poses a threat 
It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 
Labor Land Shortage
Presently  the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry as demand continues to scale up  Meanwhile  rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins 
The impact of labor land shortage is twofold  On the one hand  residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers  On the other hand  to make up for rising labor costs  homebuilders are being compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry level home buyers 
Meanwhile  a recent report by the National Association of Realtors  NARs  showed that total housing inventory declined 6 5  year over year to 1 88 million  marking the 27th consecutive year over year decline  That s only 4 5 month supply  Investors should note that it is preferable to have about six months  supply for a healthy market  Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well 
Rising land and labor costs have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp   LEN   KB Home  KBH   D R  Horton  Inc   DHI   PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM    PHM   Toll Brothers Inc   TOL  and others  While Toll Brothers and KB Home hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   the others carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma
August housing data has been weak due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma  and the sales pace is expected to remain subdued through 2017 both in Houston area and parts of Florida 
NAR has cut its 2017 forecast for sales in the wake of a tepid spring selling season and the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey  The group now expects 5 44 million homes to be sold in 2017  down 0 2  from 5 45 million in 2016 and well below 5 52 million expected earlier 
Further  economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays 
Volatile Mortgage Rates
On Sep 20  2017  the Federal Reserve  Fed  left interest rates unchanged  at 1 25  to 1 5   However  the Fed committee expects to raise borrowing costs once again this year  followed by three raises in 2018 
Speculation of further rate hikes is niggling investors in this space  Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the upcoming rises in mortgage rates given the job market strength  its influence on the industry is undeniable and uncertain 
However  with the Fed announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds  target rate  mortgage rates will probably rise in 2018 or thereafter  High mortgage rates dilute the demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 
Additionally  the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market  Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials 
Rising Prices Hurting Affordability
Rising material prices  particularly lumber  along with shortages of buildable lots and skilled labor are creating upward pressure on home prices and hindering a stronger housing recovery 
Median sales price of existing homes rose 5 6  in August from a year earlier  The national median existing home price this year is expected to increase about 6  compared to a 5 1  increase in 2016  Additionally  the median sales price of new homes sold in August was  300 200  0 4  higher than a year ago 
Rising prices have kept home buyers at bay with many postponing their search for the time being  Housing affordability fell in the second quarter of 2017  according to a National Association of Home Builders or NAHB survey 
We would prefer to avoid Century Communities  Inc   CCS  for the time being given its unfavorable Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
Bottom Line
In    we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry going forward 
As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now  Will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure short term investors

169916,391432,LEN,Lennar s Extraordinary Run,opinion,After a busy week of new economic data   as well as speeches from members of the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC    last week  this week we look toward September employment metrics  The first of these will come out ahead of the opening bell tomorrow with the ADP   NASDAQ ADP   private sector jobs totals for last month  followed by Friday s all encompassing non farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Expectations are for roughly 150 160K new jobs for the month  with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4 4  However  sometimes an earnings report from a particular company can illustrate the relative health of industries on a more macro level  and this morning we see results from new home builder Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN    This company has now beaten earnings estimates for the seventh straight quarter  which is impressive  Other reads also point to a solid fiscal Q3 2017  August   which include improved demand and higher price points along the way Lennar is based in Miami  FL  which took an indirect hit from Hurricane Irma a month ago  However  we don t see much negative impact in the company s Q3 as a result  this will likely become more obvious in the company s Q4 report  and possibly beyond   Q3 earnings of  1 06 per share topped expectations by a nickel  Revenues in the quarter rose 15  year over year to  3 26 billion  ahead of the  3 22 billion in the Zacks consensus  A higher number than expected of new homes delivered was cited for the company s outperformance Lennar also saw an increase of 20 basis points on home sales gross margin  and financial services rose 12 3  year over year  Part of this came from very impressive multi family home sales growth  up 26 7  from Q3 2016 to  103 4 million in the quarter  Further  expenses were ratcheted down a tad in Q3  with SG A costs down 9 2  year over year So what we see in microcosm here   and it will take reports from Lennar competitors such as D R  Horton   NYSE DHI   and Beazer Homes   NYSE BZH   in weeks to come to flesh out these narratives   that the new home market is showing signs of growth  They look modest  but the numbers are all pointed in the right direction  And as new homes are bought by families currently in rental units and or at home with Mom and Dad  this opens up availability for more consumers to enter those rental units  Those in starter homes may more easily upgrade to their  dream homes   helping accelerate the cycle  This is especially important as the baby boomer generation decides to downsize to smaller homes and assisted living facilities The pre market is up again across the board  following a new set of all time closing highs for the Dow  Nasdaq and S P 500  Even the more volatile Russell 2000 Small Cap looks strong  Find out more from Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras  latest Profit from the Pros   ,2017-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lennars-extraordinary-run-200216802,200216802

There was another repeat of the overnight price action Sunday night into Monday morning  buy the Globex weakness  The low overnight was 2517 00  and the high came in at 2523 50  with total volume of 155 000 futures traded  The first print on Mondays open came in at 2518 50  and then the futures ran up to 2525 75  After the high was made  the ES pulled back to down below the vwap at 2520 00  and then rallied back up to 2522 75  before pulling back down to 2520 25  one tick above the previous pull back  From there  the ES rallied back up to 2522 00  and then sold off down to 2519 00 as the Nasdaq 100 futures  NQZ17 CME  sold off down 5985 75  After the NQ bottomed  the ES traded back up to 2524 75  Throughout the decline  financial stock were firm  and kept going up 
It was another long trading day  After the initial selloff from the early high  the ES grinded higher  but there was almost no movement  Even when the NQ downticked the ES held tough  I know there are a lot of traders that wanted to sell the ES if it got to 2525  but I do not think the 6 handle drop down to 2519 was the selloff people were looking for  The dilemma for trades is plain and simple  the ES is up too high to buy  and too firm to sell 
After 2 00 pm CT  the MiM started to show anywhere from  274 million to  111 million to buy  and as it did  the ES went  bid  trading up to a new daily high of 2528 00 going into the 3 15 futures close  The overall price action was one of very small dips  followed by new highs  There was no let up  but there was a lack of trade

Another Globex session  and another all time high  While we are not trying to call tops  it just feels too high to buy higher  There was end of the month money working on Friday  and first of the month money on  Mutual fund Monday   What we are left with is a  too high to buy and too firm to sell  market 
We think with Yellen speaking tomorrow  and the unemployment number coming up on Friday  that this rally may turn into  back and fill  for now  A pullback down to the top of last week s range and yesterday s low of 2517 75 would be a good opportunity for buyers  but even a 20 handle pullback from the 2529 50 high into the heart of last week s range would likely be a gift

169980,391496,LEN,Is Lennar A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let   s put Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock   s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Lennar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Lennar   s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having fallen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock   s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Construction sector   s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is significantly undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Lennar has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year   s earnings  of just 12 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Lennar stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock   s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Lennar has a P S ratio of about 1 0  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  LEN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading   at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Lennar currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of    B     putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Lennar a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Lennar might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of    F    and a Momentum score of    A     This gives LEN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of    C      You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company   s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen six up and two down in the same time period As a result the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 20 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Lennar Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLennar is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a top sector rank and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-06-29,Zacks Investment

169981,391497,LEN,Housing Stands Tall In 2017  ETFs In Focus,opinion,"The U S  homebuilding industry is in good shape  and still one of the pillars on which the economy rests  The 2017 outlook for homebuilding is quite compelling given historically low mortgage rates  impressive first quarter 2017 existing home sale data and a tight inventory  Consistent job growth  healthy demand supply balance and seemingly high homebuilders  confidence are adding to the momentum 
 
What Numbers Have to Say
 
According to recently released existing home sales data by the National Association of Realtors  existing home sales increased 1 1  to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5 62 million units in May  Sales were 2 7  higher than the year ago level  growing at the third highest clip in the last one year   Read   
 
Notably  in the first quarter of 2017  total existing home sales rose 1 4  from the preceding quarter  marking the highest increase in a decade  This was also 5  higher than the corresponding period last year 
 
Given the low inventory situation  the median existing home price for all housing types in May was up 5 8  year over year  marking the 63rd straight month of year over year gains  It is important to note here that existing home sales make up a large part of all U S  homebuilding activity relative to new home sales   Read   
 
Meanwhile  new home sales increased 2 9  month over month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 610 000 units in May  as per the latest report released by the Commerce Department  April s sales pace was also revised sharply higher to 593 000 units from 569 000 units  Sales of new single family houses in May 2017 were 8 9  higher year over year 
 
The median house price increased to a record high of  345 800 in May from  310 200 in April thanks to robust demand  The average sales price of  406 400 in May was also a record high 
 
The housing market stands tall courtesy of continued strong job growth  The 2017 outlook for homebuilding is quite compelling  given historically low mortgage rates  healthy demand  consistent job growth and solid homebuilders  confidence  Although homebuilders  confidence dipped slightly in June  it s still above 50  which is encouraging  Moreover  mortgage rates are near historic lows even after the Fed s recent interest rate hike  Through May 2017  the U S  economy added jobs for the 80th straight month  The unemployment rate was 4 3  in May  the lowest since 2001   read more   
 
Hang Ups
 
Undeniably  the homebuilding industry saw the fastest quarterly home sales in a decade in the first quarter of 2017  and lent some much needed support to the economy  The solid sales pace was especially appreciable considering higher prices and mortgage rates 
 
That said  a tight labor market  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting the ability of homebuilders to respond to growing demand  Despite concerns over the chance of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  optimism surrounding the housing market remains unruffled  Again  with demand outstripping supply  house prices remain elevated thereby threatening affordability 
 
Though homebuilders acknowledge the rise in labor shortage and land labor cost  they in general expect the housing market to continue to recover this year in tandem with steady economic growth 
 
ETFs to Tap the Sector
 
Below we take a look at three construction ETFs that which are poised to gain from the upswing in the housing market   See all industrials ETFs  
 
SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF   
 
The fund employs a replication strategy in seeking to track the performance of the S P Homebuilders Select Industry Index  which is an equal weighted index of the homebuilding segment of a U S  total market composite index  The fund has an expense ratio   an annual fee   of 0 35  
 
The top three sectors are Building Products  31 96    Homebuilding  30 91   and Home furnishing  11 56    The top three holdings are PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM    4 64    Toll Brothers Inc   4 63   and Johnson Controls  NYSE JCI  International plc  4 57    This fund holds 37 stocks with about 45 43  invested in the top 10 holdings 
 
iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   
 
ITB tracks the Dow Jones U S  Select Home Construction Index  which measures the performance of the U S  home construction sector 
 
The top three holdings are DR Horton  NYSE DHI   11 8    Lennar Corp   10 87   and NVR Inc   8 56    The fund is heavily exposed to the Homebuilding sector  65 32    followed by Building Products  14 94   and Home Improvement Retail  8 61   
 
This fund holds 45 securities in its basket and has an expense ratio of 0 44  
 
PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Fund   
 
PKB seeks to match the performance of Dynamic Building   Construction IntellidexSM Index  which is composed of U S  building and construction companies  The top three sector allocations are Consumer Discretionary  38 49    Industrials  37 96   and Materials  18 35    Yet  the fund is more expensive than many other options in the space  charging 63 basis points in annual fees 
 
Among the 30 stocks in the basket  Owens Corning  NVR Inc  and Lennar Corp   hold the top spots with 5 24   5 09  and 4 99   respectively  of total net assets  
 
To Sum Up
 
Investors  sentiments could be dampened by the possibility of an interest rate hike  Again  skilled labor shortage is a cause of concern as demand continues to rise  Meanwhile  rising land and labor costs are restricting margins as these limit homebuilders  pricing power 
 
However  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and the long terms  In this context  the above mentioned ETFs might be sound bets to play the sector

	Chicago  IL   July 21  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include KB Home  NYSE        Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   NYSE        M D C  Holdings  Inc   NYSE         Taylor Morrison Home Corporation  NYSE       and TRI Pointe Group  Inc   NYSE       

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

5 Stocks to Buy as Housing Hits 4 Month High

	U S  housing starts turned the corner in June  rebounding from a three month long slump  Ground was broken on new homes at the sharpest annual rate recorded over four months  Surely  Wednesday s report on housing from the Department of Commerce will a long way toward restoring confidence in a sector that has had more than its fair share of troubles recently 

	Fresh questions had risen about the health of the homebuilding industry after a particularly dismal report on homebuilder sentiment was released on Tuesday  But the housing starts report indicates that demand on the buyer side remains high at a time when homebuilder stocks are surging  Picking up homebuilding stocks continues to remain a lucrative option at this time 

June Rebound Ends 3 Month Decline

	According to the Department of Commerce  housing starts increased by 8 3  from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 22 million in June  This represents a 2 1  annual increase  the highest recorded in four months  June s housing starts were also considerably higher than the estimated level of 1 16 million  The increase experienced last month comes after three straight monthly declines  Additionally  May s housing starts figure of 1 09 million  originally the lowest recorded in eight months  was revised upward to 1 12 million 

	Building permits also increased  by 7 4   to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1 25 million  The forward looking metric also experienced a year over year increase of 5 1   implying that housing activity is likely to remain strong in the near future  Meanwhile  single family starts increased by 6 3   indicating that homebuilding companies were prioritizing homes built for sale over those intended for rentals 

	Construction of multifamily homes  which includes apartment buildings and townhouses  increased by 13 3   This substantial increase represents a strong rebound after five consecutive months of declines  Additionally  housing starts experienced increases over three of the four geographical regions surveyed  This includes a 22  jump in the Midwest  Meanwhile  housing completions increased by 5 2  to the highest level witnessed since Nov 2016 

Is Falling Homebuilder Confidence Really a Worry  

	The bullish housing starts report is particularly significant since it comes immediately after a substantial decline in homebuilder sentiment  In July  homebuilder sentiment declined from 67 to 64  its lowest level in eight months  The immediate trigger for the decline is the rising cost of construction materials  following the imposition of a steep tariff on Canadian lumber  Initially  homebuilders were hopeful that President Trump would deliver on promises to curtail regulations  However  the index remains well above 50  which means that improvement in the sector continues  but at a slower pace 

	But the industry is less hopeful of action on the policy front  since Trump s promises continue to remain unfulfilled  Instead  homebuilders are depending on steady demand from buyers  borne out by the latest data on groundbreaking for homes  A strong labor market and a soft interest rate regime have ensured consistent gains for homebuilder stocks  For instance  LGI Homes and D R  Horton have gained 48 3  and 34 1  year to date  The SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  has increased by 15  over the same period

169984,391500,LEN,Rate Sensitive ETFs In Focus As Fed Meets,opinion,All eyes are currently on the crucial two day FOMC meeting slated to start today  The central bank is expected to hold rates steady and lay out plans to unwind its  4 5 trillion balance sheet  It will likely reduce bond holdings by a maximum of  50 billion per month  or  600 billion per year Both the latest  and  reveal that the Fed will unveil the timing of its balance sheet unwinding in September and wait until December to raise interest rates again  As such  rate sensitive ETFs are in vogue  read    In the latest testimony  Fed Chair Janet Yellen stated that she is not in a rush to raise interest rates and will continue to follow a gradual rate hike plan given the lower inflationary pressure  U S  consumer price remained flat in June against the expectation of a 0 2  increase  signaling doubts over the third rate hike this year  This represents year over year growth of 1 6   the smallest gain since October 2016  after a rise of 1 9  in May   Per the central bank  interest rates are close to the neutral level   a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity  The current target for the funds rate is 1 1 25  while inflation is around 1 4   implying that the real rate is close to zero  according to   read    The Fed s dovish view and dimming prospect of rates hike in the near term has pushed Treasury yields lower  which in turn is benefiting rate sensitive and high yield sectors such as utilities and real estates  Additionally  the ongoing turmoil in Washington and growing geopolitical concerns are making investors jittery  raising the appeal for these sectors  This is because these sectors act as a safe haven in times of market turbulence and concurrently offer higher returns due to their outsized yields As a result  investors could make a near term play on rate sensitive sectors in the basket form  as these will continue to trade smoothly if interest rates remain

	Chicago  IL   June 19  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Housing  Part 3  including Lennar Corp   NYSE         KB Home  NYSE         D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE         PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM    NYSE        and Toll Brothers Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Housing  Part 3

	Link  

	Undeniably  the homebuilding industry saw the fastest quarterly home sales in a decade in the first quarter of 2017  and lent some much needed support to the economy  The solid sales pace was especially appreciable considering higher prices and mortgage rates 

	Though a healthy job market and an impressive demand supply balance will probably draw buyers  there are other factors that might deal a fresh blow to the housing industry 

	Rising interest and mortgage rates  as well as land and labor shortages  raise concerns    as do tedious underwriting standards  Intensifying competition also poses a threat 

	It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 

Labor Land Shortage

	At present  the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry as demand continues to scale up  Meanwhile  rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins 

	The impact of labor land shortage is twofold  On the one hand  residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers  On the other hand  to make up for rising labor costs  homebuilders are compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry level home buyers 

	Meanwhile  a recent report by the National Association of Realtors showed that average supply during the first three months of 2017 was 3 7 months  down from 4 2 months in the first quarter of last year  Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well 

	Rising land and labor costs    mainly the latter    have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp   NYSE         KB Home  NYSE         D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE         PulteGroup Inc   NYSE        and Toll Brothers Inc   NYSE        in recent quarters  While KB Home holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   all the other stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

Volatile Mortgage Rates

	On Mar 15  2017  the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since the 2008 financial crisis  Interest rate increased by 25 basis points to the range of 0 75 1  

	Speculation of further rate hikes is bothering investors in this space  Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the recent rise in mortgage rates on job market strength  its influence on the industry in 2017 is undeniable and uncertain 

	However  with the Federal Reserve announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds  target rate  mortgage rates will probably rise in 2017 or thereafter  High mortgage rates dilute the demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 

	Additionally  the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market  Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials 

Bottom Line

	In        we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry going forward 

	As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now   will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure in short term investors

170014,391530,LEN,Markets Trim Monday Gains,opinion,"U S  equities erased some of the gains seen yesterday  with tech issues applying pressure  along with energy stocks following a sharp decline in crude oil prices on oversupply concerns amid a flood of output coming from Libya and Nigeria  Meanwhile  an uncertain political landscape also contributed to the uncertainty  Treasuries were higher with the economic calendar again empty  while gold was little changed and the U S  dollar gained ground 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  fell 62 points  0 3   to 21 467  the S P 500 Index declined 16 points  0 7   to 2 437  and the NASDAQ Composite decreased 51 points  0 8   to 6 188  In moderately heavy volume  811 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 2 5 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil declined  0 92 to  43 51 per barrel and wholesale gasoline lost  0 03 to  1 42 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price decreased  1 37 to  1 242 47 per ounce  and the dollar index  a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies  was 0 2  higher at 97 76 
Lennar Corp   NYSE LEN  54  posted a Q2 profit of  0 91 per share  well above the FactSet consensus estimate of  0 79  on a 19  year over year  y y  increase in revenues to  3 3 billion  also eclipsing the  2 8 billion forecast  Chief Executive Officer Stuart Miller said the strong results  were supported by an improved macroeconomic environment  renewed optimism  wage and job growth  and increased consumer confidence   He added that despite recent housing reports the company is seeing the market revert more to normal than the slow and steady recovery pace of the last several years  Shares were nicely higher 
Biopharmaceutical company PAREXEL International Corp   NASDAQ PRXL  87  confirmed that it will be acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for  88 10 per share in cash  or an enterprise value of roughly  5 billion  including debt  The purchase price represents about a 5  premium to yesterday s closing price and a near 28  premium since early May when speculation of a deal surfaced  Shares of PRXL were higher 
The NASDAQ pared yesterday s rally  and its best day since November  which has lagged the Dow and S P due to the recent pressure on technology issues 
Economic calendar remains quiet  gets in motion tomorrow
Treasuries were higher  as the economic calendar was again void of any major releases today  The yield on the 2 Year note was 1 basis point  bp  lower at 1 35   the yield on the 10 Year note was down 3 basis points  bps  at 2 16   and the 30 Year bond rate declined 5 bps to 2 74  
Treasury yields have been in a trading range amid a host of domestic and European political uncertainty  mixed economic data  and last week s highly expected rate hike by the Fed and details of the process in beginning to shrink its balance sheet sometime this year 
The economic calendar is scant this week  and won t get moving until tomorrow  where housing will take center stage with the release of existing home sales  with economists forecasting a slight downtick during May to an annual rate of 5 55 million units  as well as weekly MBA Mortgage Applications  More housing data will come later in the week via the new home sales report  Manufacturing and business activity will also likely be on tap  with data from Markit s preliminary Manufacturing and Services PMIs and the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index  Other reports of note include weekly initial jobless claims and the Index of Leading Economic Indicators 
A couple of Federal Reserve officials spoke yesterday  with some hawkish comments coming from Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley  with a host of other speeches at various engagements slated for today and throughout the remainder of the week  We believe the market will likely largely look past the expected FOMC rate hike  and focus more on any information with regard to the Fed s balance sheet 
It is now expected that the Fed will begin the process of slowly reducing its bloated balance sheet by the end of this year  but that process  and commentary surrounding it  could be a source of elevated volatility in the months to come 
European equities lower on oil  politics and Brexit worries  Asia mixed
European equities finished lower  with pressure coming from energy stocks amid the tumble in crude oil prices  and as Brexit talks were in focus after negotiations officially began yesterday in Brussels  According to Reuters  chief negotiators from the European Union  EU  and the U K  agreed that dialogue up through October should focus on expatriate citizens  rights and the settling of financial accounts 
The British pound added to its recent slide versus the U S  dollar amid the uncertainty  as well as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney s comments on his continued worries of the impact of Brexit on the U K  economy  and after signaling that as a result he isn t in any rush to begin adjusting interest rates  Adding to the mix  investors continue to struggle with the recent U K  election that surprisingly resulted in a hung parliament and fostered uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations and whether they will yield hard or softer exit terms  Amid the political turmoil overseas  are the upcoming elections in Italy and Germany later this year 
In economic news  Spain s trade deficit widened more than expected for April  and producer prices in Germany matched expectations  The euro is also modestly lower versus the greenback and bond yields in the region are mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed  as yesterday s optimism over the MSCI s decision on China cooled a bit  Investors are waiting to see if MSCI will include the Asian nation s A shares in its emerging markets indexes when it announces its decision later this week  This will be the fourth shot at MSCI inclusion for China after being passed over the prior three attempts  Whispers on the Street currently put the odds of inclusion at 50 50 
Japanese equities rose  with the yen losing ground  and following a report that showed noted improvement in the nation s business sentiment  hitting its highest level in nearly a decade  Mainland Chinese stocks and those traded in Hong Kong fell on tempered hopes of MSCI s upcoming decision  while investors also begin to look toward high level talks between the U S  and China that begin tomorrow  with U S  officials not hiding its intent to continue to pressure China on help with the North Korea issue  Elsewhere  South Korean securities ticked lower and Indian listings were flat 
Australian markets fell on the heels of Moody s downgrade of twelve of the nation s lenders  including its four largest banks  and after the Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its last monetary policy meeting which showed the central bank was concerned about household debt and wage growth  despite being positive about economic progress going forward 
Items set for release on tomorrow s international economic calendar include Japan s All Industry Index  industrial orders from Spain  and public sector net borrowing from the U K ",2017-06-21,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-trim-monday-gains-200196422,200196422

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin Matras  

Winning Stock Picks from Top 5 Industries with Biggest Job Growth  

	Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment 

	In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports 

	And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive 

	This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading 

	For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted 

	I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them 

	In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look 

	But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile  or paragraph  

	Well here we are again  with more stock picking insight  straight from last week s Employment Situation report  Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries 

	1  Professional and Business Services   38 000

	2  Food Services   Drinking Places   30 000
	 up 267 000 over the last 12 months 

	3  HealthCare   24 000
	 up 224 000 over the last 12 months 

	4  Construction   11 000
	 up 160 000 over the last 6 months 

	5  Finance   11 000

	Once these reports point you in the right direction  you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups 

	This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis  But you can go to any screener  like the one on Zacks com or the Research Wizard  and locate the sector  then industry of interest 

	Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock picking criteria to drill down to the best ones  such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s  Strong Buys or Buys   market beating growth rates  below industry valuations  upward earnings estimate revisions  etc 

	Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week s Employment report 

	 NYSE       Total System Services
	 Business Services 

	 NYSE       Performance Food Group
	 Food Services   Drinking Places 

	 NYSE       Wellcare Health Plans
	 HealthCare 

	 NYSE       Lennar
	 Construction 

	 NYSE       Franklin Resources
	 Finance 

	Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place  But instead of waiting for the next great stock to fall into your lap  you can actively search for them  And by reading a few extra reports and then putting those ideas into a capable screener  you ll soon be amazed at some of the new picks you come up with

170038,391554,LEN,How Homebuilding Can Be Constructive To Your Portfolio,opinion,"First quarter 2017 showed dismal economic growth  Nevertheless  housing got off to a good start this year attributable to low interest rates  trending down since March   This  along with solid job growth  has bolstered housing demand 
Last year was reasonably good for the housing market and the trend is expected to continue this year  courtesy of a healthy demand supply balance  historically low mortgage rates  escalating rent costs and easy availability of loans  Again  there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials  a generation that had to some extent refrained some from entering the market 
For that matter  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector for both the short and the long term 
Below we discuss some of the key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead 
Higher Demand  Low Inventory Boost Sales
Steady economic growth along with favorable demographics  historically low interest rates and the attractiveness of owning versus rent are driving demand  Although GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 was slower than the preceding quarter  residential investment contributed 0 5  to GDP growth  Residential investment saw 13 8  annualized growth 
Per the National Association of Realtors or NAR  total existing home sales  which include both single family and condos  rose 1 4  sequentially to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5 62 million in the first quarter  marking the highest growth in a decade  Also  total existing home sales increased 5  year over year 
For 2017  existing home sales are projected to increase 3 5  from 2016 levels  while new single family home sales will increase 10 9  nationally  as per the National Association of Realtors   
On the other hand  a shortage in buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is boosting new home sales and is expected to continue doing so for some time 
At the end of the first quarter  there were 1 83 million existing homes available for sale  which was down 6 6  year over year  as per data released by the NAR  The average supply during the first quarter was 3 7 months  showing a decrease from 4 2 months in the first quarter of last year 
Even at the end of April  the total housing inventory level had 1 93 million existing homes available for sale  The reported figure was 9  lower year over year and has fallen for 23 consecutive months 
Healthy Demand Supply Balance to Lift Price
Last year  prices crept up every month  Although gains may decelerate to a certain extent  we expect prices to continue to ascend  The national median existing single family home price in the first quarter was  232 100  reflecting an increase of 6 9  year over year  This marks as the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2015 that registered 8 2  price appreciation 
Higher rates may impact housing demand  However  the supply side dynamics of the U S  housing market support higher home prices 
We believe prices will continue to scale despite decelerating sales growth as demand for homes is like to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment  Improving labor markets  declining unemployment rates  low mortgage rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices  thereby boosting homebuilders  top line 
Although the recent bump up in interest rates has raised concerns over the outlook of home prices in 2017  the rates should remain reasonable  in our view  keeping housing affordable  Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a positive for the housing sector 
After all  the underlying driver of the upward movement in interest rates is increased economic growth expectations  A booming economy boosts income as well  Thus  if the rise in income offsets the increase in mortgage payment  housing will do just fine 
Some analysts are of the opinion that the hike largely follows the euphoria of Trump s election win  Probably  builders are hopeful that Trump will follow through on his pledge to ease some regulations that are marring housing affordability and business for small enterprises 
Stable Economic Growth
President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Although this may face varied obstacles  we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2017 
The U S  economy grew 1 2  in the first quarter of 2017  down from 2 1  growth in the preceding quarter  Despite weak growth  the labor market helped the industry to maintain its stature  Through May 2017  the U S  economy added jobs for 80 straight months  The unemployment rate was 4 3  in May  which was lowest since 2001  Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides a basis for stronger demand 
With a fall in the unemployment rate  rising wages and decent consumer confidence  the U S  economy looks quite strong despite rising pressure elsewhere 
Millennials Take Interest
Millennials  born after 1980  are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section  although many disagree with this view  This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce 
According to the 2017 National Association of Realtors Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends study  millennials account for 34  of all buyers and make up for the largest share of home buyers 
Boosting Land Bank Amid Rising Costs
U S  homebuilders have been seeking various ways to increase their land holding amid rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market that hinder efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market  Again  limited capital for land development has left entitled lands in short supply while growing demand drove land prices higher  The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of labor  arresting the rapid growth in housing production 
Land development and homebuilding are correlated but fundamentally different operations  Prominent homebuilders are buying out major land developers that will help them to address the ongoing issues  In Jun 2017  D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  offered to buy 75  of the shares of Forestar Group Inc   FOR   a residential and mixed use real estate development company  for about  520 million in cash  Successful completion of the deal will strengthen D R  Horton s foothold in Texas 
With an impressive second quarter sales backlog of  4 4 billion and a well stocked supply of land  lots and homes  D R  Horton is a best in class homebuilder that will benefit from a strong strategic relationship with a separate land development company like Forestar  The deal will also help the company to deepen its focus on maximizing return on assets and inventory turns 
Another homebuilding company  Lennar Corp  LEN   acquired Florida based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc   a premier lifestyle community developer and luxury homebuilder of single and multi family homes in Feb 2017 to enhance its land holdings 
Falling Mortgage Rates Make Homes Affordable
High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers buyers  purchasing power and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 
According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate went down to the lowest levels in nearly seven months to 3 89  for the week ending Jun 8  2017  The decline in rates should spur refinance activity even more  thereby leading to more home sales 
Even if mortgage interest rates rise with the Fed probably announcing further federal fund rate hikes later this year or the next  the rates should still remain reasonable  in our view  keeping housing affordable  Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a net positive for the housing sector 
Moreover  improving labor markets  falling unemployment rates  low mortgage rates and limited home supply are supporting continued rise in home prices  thereby booting homebuilders  top line 
How to Play the Industry
Major homebuilders are well poised on the positive fundamentals of the housing market  Particularly  given the cheap valuation compared with the broader market  this is perhaps the right time to pick a few stocks from this space  We recommend those that are witnessing positive estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  
One such company is M I Homes  Inc   MHO   The company sports a Zacks Rank  1 and advanced 54 2  in the last year  The stock has seen 17 3  upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and 12 8  for 2018  over the last 60 days 
Lyon William Homes  WLH   a Zacks Rank  2 stock  has gained nearly 39  in the last year  Earnings estimates for the current year and the next have also gone up by 8 1  and 2 7   respectively  in the last 60 days  The upside in earnings estimate revisions point at unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company 
KB Home  KBH   a Zacks Rank  2 stock  has gained almost 56 6  in the period  Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 0 6  and 0 5  for 2017 and 2018 in the last 60 days  The company has solid expected earnings growth of 43 3  for the current year and 22 2  for the next  Also  the stock surpassed earnings estimates by an average 7 3  over the trailing four quarters 
M D C  Holdings  Inc   MDC  shares climbed 55 8  in the last year and carries a Zacks Rank  2  It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter being marginally revised upward in the last 60 days  The company has solid expected earnings growth of 27 1  for the current year on 13 1  revenue growth 
You can see  
Conclusion
Though homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land labor costs  they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth 
Overall  the positive supply and demand fundamentals have led to incredible hikes in home prices and are likely to provide some resiliency in the face of moderately rising interest rates in 2017 
Investors could also take advantage of the opportunities in the near term and cash in on any sudden surge in the homebuilding sector

170039,391555,LEN,Homebuilding Challenged By Rising Labor  Land Costs,opinion,"Undeniably  the homebuilding industry saw the fastest quarterly home sales in a decade in the first quarter of 2017  and lent some much needed support to the economy  The solid sales pace was especially appreciable considering higher prices and mortgage rates 
Though a healthy job market and an impressive demand supply balance will probably draw buyers  there are other factors that might deal a fresh blow to the housing industry 
Rising interest and mortgage rates  as well as land and labor shortages  raise concerns    as do tedious underwriting standards  Intensifying competition also poses a threat 
It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 
Labor Land Shortage
At present  the problem of skilled labor shortage is taking its worst shape in the homebuilding industry as demand continues to scale up  Meanwhile  rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins 
The impact of labor land shortage is twofold  On the one hand  residential construction is failing to meet demand in the absence of sufficient workers  On the other hand  to make up for rising labor costs  homebuilders are compelled to raise home prices to maintain margins that would deter entry level home buyers 
Meanwhile  a recent report by the National Association of Realtors showed that average supply during the first three months of 2017 was 3 7 months  down from 4 2 months in the first quarter of last year  Land supply could remain a challenge for the housing industry in the coming quarters as well 
Rising land and labor costs    mainly the latter    have hurt gross margins for the likes of Lennar Corp   LEN   KB Home  KBH   D R  Horton  Inc   DHI   PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM    PHM  and Toll Brothers Inc   TOL  in recent quarters  While KB Home holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   all the other stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Volatile Mortgage Rates
On Mar 15  2017  the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since the 2008 financial crisis  Interest rate increased by 25 basis points to the range of 0 75 1  
Speculation of further rate hikes is bothering investors in this space  Although we see limited impact on housing demand from the recent rise in mortgage rates on job market strength  its influence on the industry in 2017 is undeniable and uncertain 
However  with the Federal Reserve announcing a hike in the benchmark Federal Funds  target rate  mortgage rates will probably rise in 2017 or thereafter  High mortgage rates dilute the demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 
Additionally  the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market  Higher interest rates will only flare up the issues and further delay home purchases by millennials 
Bottom Line
In    we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry going forward 
As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now   will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure in short term investors

170061,391577,LEN,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  IShares Dow Jones US Home Construction ETF  SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF And PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Portfolio,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 25  2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction ETF  NYSEARCA            SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  NYSEARCA           and PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Portfolio   NYSEARCA          

Top Ranked Housing ETFs for a Hot Spring Selling Season 

	Homebuyers are rushing into the market as the spring selling season heats up  Existing home sales jumped 4 4  from February to an adjusted annual rate of 5 71 million in March  their strongest pace in a decade  This was much better than the economists  estimate of a 2 2  gain to 5 6 million  Sales were particularly strong in the Northeast and the Midwest regions   Read    

	 Bolstered by strong consumer confidence and underlying demand  home sales are up convincingly from a year ago nationally and in all four major regions despite the fact that buying a home has gotten more expensive over the past year   according to the National Association of Realtors 

	Improving jobs market  rising wages and low interest rates have supported the housing market even though the inventory remains low and prices have been rising  However  with completions of new homes  compared with last month and 13  year over year  housing market could see some easing in supply shortages 

	While rising prices have been a concern  the recent decline in mortgage rates has improved affordability and could further boost the housing market 

	With the key spring selling season off to a strong start  investors should take a look at housing ETFs that have been outperforming the market this year 

A Deeper Dive into Housing ETFs

	From their names  theiShares Dow Jones US Home Construction ETF  NYSEARCA           and the SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSEARCA           sound pretty similar  However  if you look deeper  these funds are quite different   Read    

	ITB has approximately two thirds of its portfolio allocated to homebuilders  15  to building products companies and 7  to the home improvement retail  It is a market cap weighted product and leading names  DR Horton  NYSE DHI  and Lennar  NYSE LEN  account for almost a quarter of total assets  It has an expense ratio of 43 basis points 

	ITB has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is up more than 17  year to date  It is quite popular with  1 5 billion in AUM 

	XHB has heaviest allocation to the building products industry  35    while exposure to homebuilders is a little less than 30   It follows an equal weighting methodology for its 36 holdings 

	So  with XHB  investors get a much lower exposure to homebuilding heavyweights but it could be a suitable option for investors who believe that home improvement  remodeling companies will continue to do well even if home sales slow down 

	XHB is slightly cheaper with an expense ratio of 35 basis points  It is also ranked Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is up more than 11  year to date  The product has about  1 1 in AUM 

	Another ETF to consider is the PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Portfolio   NYSEARCA           It holds 30 companies that provide construction and related engineering services 

	The fund has highest exposure to the construction materials  21   and building products  21   industries  NVR and PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  are the top holdings as of now 

	If you believe that the Trump administration may come out with a big infrastructure spending plan soon  then this is the right product for you  In fact  it had surged after the election but has underperformed this year  as the Trump trade unwound 

	The product is a smart beta ETF that evaluates companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria  including price momentum  earnings momentum  quality  management action  and value 

	PKB is not as popular as the other two  with  306 in AUM  It is also more expensive with 63 basis points in expense ratio 

	The product is currently Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is up more than 5  this year

	Chicago  IL   May 31  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Gildan Activewear  NYSE         Steve Madden  NASDAQ         WABCO Holdings  NYSE         Colfax Corp   NYSE        and Lennar Corp   NYSE        

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research by Kevin Matras  

Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch Up Moves

	Given the recent run up in the market  here s a screen I ve been using recently for my own stock picking 

	First  it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries  Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank  1s   2s and  3s  which are Strong Buys  Buys and Holds  respectively  But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks 

	Why would I do something like that 

	Here s why 

	You ve probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock s price movement can be attributed to the group that it s in  And that s true  In fact  oftentimes  even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason 

	Now  take a look at any top group  You ll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there  But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time  Some will move more than others at any given time 

	So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change  you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch up move 

	Here s how to set up that screen 

	  Best Zacks Ranked Sectors    Best 8
	We re screening for only those stocks with the best  lowest  average Zacks Rank  With 16 sectors  the best 8 sectors give us the best 50  of sectors 

	  Best Zacks Ranked Industries    Best 132
	Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru  Since there are 264  X  or expanded industries we look at  the best 132 will give us the best 50  of industries  But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru  If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it s outside of the top sector rank  it will not get thru 

	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 3
	Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank  1s   2s and  3s  No Sells or Strong Sells  Zacks Rank  4s and  5s  allowed 

	   Price and Avg  Volume greater than or equal to  5 and 100 000 shares 
	Only stocks over  5 with at least an average of 100 0000 shares traded daily will be considered 

	  Relative   Price Change    4 Weeks greater than 0
	This means we re screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market  S P 500  over the last 4 weeks 

	    Change in Price    4 Weeks  Bottom 50
	Then finally we re scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks  So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market  they increased in price less than their peers 

	So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector  This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1 

	Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks  you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from 

	And from that list of winners  we re selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list  Remember  these stocks aren t  dogs  or unresponsive stocks  Quite the contrary  they have all outperformed the market  It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list  But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry  we ve singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to  catch up  to the others 

	It s an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names 

	Here are 5 from that list 

	 NYSE       Gildan Activewear
	 NASDAQ       Steve Madden
	 NYSE       WABCO Holdings
	 NYSE       Colfax Corp 
	 NYSE       Lennar Corp 

	All great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them 

	Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test  It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software

170065,391581,LEN,Can t Keep A Good Market Down,opinion,"This morning s Government Employment Situation report was a kick to the gut  especially coming just a day after ADP s jobs report beat expectations by more than 40   Instead  only 138 000 jobs were created last month according to the BLS  instead of the 185 000 expected  The prior month was revised lower too But the market really didn t care 
For the second consecutive session  each of the major indices closed at record highs  The S P climbed 0 37  to 2439 1  while the Dow was up 0 29  to 21 206 3 and the NASDAQ advanced 0 94  to 6305 8  This was a short week due to the Memorial Day holiday on Monday  and the first two sessions were pretty somber  But the market really caught fire on the back half  For the full week  the S P advanced 1   the Dow increased 0 6  and the NASDAQ gained 1 5  The final two days also saw the portfolios wake up  On Friday  Insider Trader added three times  while Options Trader made two moves  Reitmeister Trading Alert  TAZR Trader and Value Investor also bought  The highlights are waiting for you below Today s Portfolio Highlights Insider Trader  It was a busy day for the portfolio as Tracey made five moves  The editor sold OXY and WSBC today  and used the proceeds and the cash on hand to buy three new positions with allocations between 7  and 9  each  The new buys are   AquaVenture  WAAS  is a small cap water company that went public in October 2016 but is down 30  year to date  Analysts feel that the stock is undervalued  as do a couple insiders  including the CEO  who bought shares over the past two weeks as a show of confidence   CDK Global  CDK  is a dealer management system  DMS  company for the automotive sector that s in a transformation period right now  The CEO bought shares last week  possibly as a sign of confidence after the CFO resigned  With earnings expected to grow about 40  this fiscal year  Tracey says that CDK has  a surprising growth story for a large mid cap company    Weight Watchers  WTW  had a strong first quarter report thanks in large part to the collaboration with Oprah  Earnings are expected to rise 31  this year  A director bought twice since the earnings report  which is a really bullish sign since shares of WTW are at its highs rather than pulling back The full commentary has A LOT more on all of today s moves Reitmeister Trading Alert  Shares of Athene Holding Ltd   ATH  have dipped 10  after getting up to  55 on a strong earnings announcement  Steve thinks this selloff is overdone and that fair value is about  60 for this financial services and insurance firm  Plus  it is a Zacks Rank  2 from a highly ranked industry with a Zacks VGM Score of B  Therefore  he added ATH to the portfolio on Friday  If the company can put together another solid quarter  the editor wouldn t be surprised to see this name get up to  70  Get more specifics in the write up TAZR Trader  Tech is STILL leading this market higher  and Kevin is ready to get back into RISK ON mode again  On Friday  the editor returned to Applied Optoelectronics  AAOI   a small cap fiber optic networking products company that s on its way to becoming a mid cap  Kevin is willing to ride the volatile waves with AAOI since he expects the stock to reach  100 by December and will be adding on any dips below  70  The portfolio will take a 7  allocation  Read the full write up for a lot more on this pick Options Trader  The portfolio added two sets of bull call spreads on Friday  First up  homebuilder Lennar  NYSE LEN  is breaking out of a bullish flagging pattern  and Kevin thinks this Zacks Rank  2 will eventually challenge its all time high of  69  So the editor bought to open 2 Nov 52 50 Calls AND sold to open 2 Nov 57 50 Calls Meanwhile  Kevin thinks a breakout is coming for IT company CDW  CDW   which has an upside breakout point around  61  The editor wants to be part of this move  so he bought to open 2 Sept  60 00 Calls AND sold to open 2 Sept 65 00 Calls  Read the full writeup for more on both of these spreads Value Investor  Tracey likes the container companies right now because this cyclical space seems ready for an uptrend amid strong global growth  For example  Triton  TRTN  blew past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its first quarter report  and is expected to grow earnings by 174  in 2017 thanks in part to its merger with TAL  It also has low P E and P B ratios  along with a juicy dividend that yielding 6 2   Due to all these factors  the editor feels that TRTN would be a good addition to the portfolio  Read the complete commentary for more Zacks Counterstrike   The jobs number was surprisingly lower than expected this morning considering what the ADP number showed us yesterday  Payrolls came in at 138k v the 182k expected  while unemployment ticked lower to 4 3   Markets were strong overnight  but the weak data brought in sellers early in the morning  However  the buyers showed up again and took the S P 500 to record highs once more  The S P finished up 0 37   while the Nasdaq added 0 94    Today the S P 500  the Dow  and the Nasdaq all finished at all time highs  Market participants have to start wondering if this market will ever go down  And if it does  just what will create a sell off big enough to bring some volatility back into equities  I don t have the answer  but I can say that this market is very strong  In my eyes  there is just no risk out there at the moment  so let your long positions fly until there is a reason to get out      Zacks CounterstrikeHave a Great Weekend

170066,391582,LEN,Here s Why You Should Add EMCOR  EMR  To Your Portfolio,opinion,"Leading mechanical and electrical services provider  EMCOR Group  Inc    NYSE EME   had a solid start to 2017  setting new records for revenues and net income  Late in April  the company came up with its first quarter 2017 results  wherein adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 88 cents trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29 4  
An outstanding performance in the construction segment  building services and industrial services set the tone for strong future growth  which is reflected in the company s healthy backlog and 2017 guidance  Encouragingly  EMCOR enjoyed a strong bull run on the bourse  having generated a return of 33 7   which is almost five times the Zacks categorized  industry s average gain of 6 6  

Read on to find out the key factors which make this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company an attractive proposition for investors right now 
Factors to Buy
Revenue Strength  EMCOR s revenues have observed a compounded annual growth rate   CAGR   of 6 1  from 2011 to 2016  Over the past few years  increased project activity within the commercial and transportation market sector has been driving growth of the U S  Electrical Construction segment 
Growth of U S  Mechanical Construction segment has been driven by sturdy performance and strong execution in commercial  manufacturing  healthcare and transportation markets  Also  EMCOR reiterated revenue guidance for 2017 between  7 5 billion and  7 6 billion 
Impressive VGM Score  The company has a VGM score of  B   The score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth and momentum characteristics  and a good score indicates stronger chances of success  Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of  A  or  B   when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  offer the best upside potential 
Positive Analyst Sentiment  Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company over the last month  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 earnings trended up over the same time frame from  3 39 to  3 46  supported by two upward estimate revisions versus zero downward 
In fact  encouraged by its solid top line performance  accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U S  construction space  EMCOR s management raised its 2017 guidance  with earnings from continuing operations projected in the range of  3 20  3 50  up from previous projections of  3 10  3 50 
Robust Inorganic Prospects  EMCOR s keen eye for strategic acquisitions has strongly boosted the company s inorganic growth  Its acquisition strategies are directed toward buying small private firms with proven management and expansion potential  Over time  these buyouts have fortified EMCOR s market leading position in electrical construction and services  and expanded its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors 
During first quarter 2017  the company acquired two firms   one in fire protection and one in mechanical services  Both acquisitions will add unique capabilities to the company s portfolio and broaden its geographic footprint  For first quarter 2017  acquisitions contributed about  77 7 million of total revenues 
Other Stocks to Consider
Other top ranked stocks in the industry include TopBuild Corp    NYSE BLD    Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   and Weyerhaeuser Co    NYSE WY    While TopBuild sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Lennar and Weyerhaeuser carry a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
TopBuild has a positive average earnings surprise of 6 0  for the last four quarters  having beaten estimates three times 
Lennar has a stellar earnings surprise history with an average positive surprise of 8 7   beating estimates all through 
Weyerhaeuser has an average positive surprise of 1 3   beating estimates twice for as many misses over the trailing four quarters

170083,391599,LEN,Top Ranked Housing ETFs For A Hot Spring Selling Season,opinion,"Homebuyers are rushing into the market as the spring selling season heats up  Existing home sales jumped 4 4  from February to an adjusted annual rate of 5 71 million in March  their strongest pace in a decade  This was much better than the economists  estimate of a 2 2  gain to 5 6 million  Sales were particularly strong in the Northeast and the Midwest regions   Read   
 Bolstered by strong consumer confidence and underlying demand  home sales are up convincingly from a year ago nationally and in all four major regions despite the fact that buying a home has gotten more expensive over the past year   according to the National Association of Realtors 
Improving jobs market  rising wages and low interest rates have supported the housing market even though the inventory remains low and prices have been rising  However  with completions of new homes  compared with last month and 13  year over year  housing market could see some easing in supply shortages 
While rising prices have been a concern  the recent decline in mortgage rates has improved affordability and could further boost the housing market 
With the key spring selling season off to a strong start  investors should take a look at housing ETFs that have been outperforming the market this year 

A Deeper Dive into Housing ETFs
From their names  the iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction ETF    and the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF    sound pretty similar  However  if you look deeper  these funds are quite different   Read   
ITB has approximately two thirds of its portfolio allocated to homebuilders  15  to building products companies and 7  to the home improvement retail  It is a market cap weighted product and leading names DR Horton  NYSE DHI     and Lennar    account for almost a quarter of total assets  It has an expense ratio of 43 basis points 
ITB has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is up more than 17  year to date  It is quite popular with  1 5 billion in AUM 
XHB has heaviest allocation to the building products industry  35    while exposure to homebuilders is a little less than 30   It follows an equal weighting methodology for its 36 holdings 
So  with XHB  investors get a much lower exposure to homebuilding heavyweights but it could be a suitable option for investors who believe that home improvement  remodeling companies will continue to do well even if home sales slow down 
XHB is slightly cheaper with an expense ratio of 35 basis points   It is also ranked Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and is up more than 11  year to date  The product has about  1 1 in AUM 
Another ETF to consider is the PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Portfolio     It holds 30 companies that provide construction and related engineering services 
The fund has highest exposure to the construction materials  21   and building products  21   industries  NVR    and PulteGroup  NYSE PHM     are the top holdings as of now 
If you believe that the Trump administration may come out with a big infrastructure spending plan soon  then this is the right product for you  In fact  it had surged after the election but has underperformed this year  as the Trump trade unwound 
The product is a smart beta ETF that evaluates companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria  including price momentum  earnings momentum  quality  management action  and value 
PKB is not as popular as the other two  with  306 in AUM  It is also more expensive with 63 basis points in expense ratio 
The product is currently Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is up more than 5  this year

170107,391623,LEN,Factors That May Unsettle Housing Stocks,opinion,"Though Brexit related uncertainties and global economic pressure are not expected to have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity  there are other factors that can pull it back  As per the latest Q3 data released by the Commerce Department on Oct 28  2016  the U S  economy registered its fastest growth in two years  However  the drop in spending on residential construction is alarming 
Again  land and labor shortages have become valid concerns  and so are tedious underwriting standards  And you can t evade competition that can at times get fierce and ignore cost inflation 
It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below  we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 
Soft Housing Data
The housing sector remained a soft spot in Q3  Residential fixed investment declined for the second straight quarter  falling at a 6 2  annual rate over the summer following a 7 7  drop in the spring  and had a negative impact of 0 24  in the overall GDP growth rate in Q3 
Residential fixed investment had been a stable contributor to growth  but it has been weakened by volatility in housing starts in the first half of 2016 
Interest Rate Hike in the Cards 
One factor that could be hurting investors  sentiments is the possibility of an interest rate hike 
Solid Q3 growth numbers clear the way for the Federal Reserve or Fed to raise interest rates at the end of 2016  The Fed is expected to hike interest rates when it meets in December  which could be the first increase in a year  The Fed has not raised rates this year even after signaling four rate hikes in 2016 last December 
That number has since been scaled down to two this year  with another three hikes scheduled for 2017  owing to a global slowdown  financial market volatility and tepid U S  inflation  Sluggish growth along with a tepid jobs report in May have also held the Fed back from raising rates earlier in 2016 
It is to be noted in this regard that a rate hike could make mortgages more expensive 
Labor Land Shortages
Several years of production deficits during the housing downturn resulted in a limited supply of both rental and new homes in the country  At present  a shortage of buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing 
The labor market has tightened with limited availability arresting the rapid growth in housing production  Labor supply is expected to remain tight through the rest of the year  Also  capital constraints for land and land development have left entitled lands in short supply while increasing demand has driven land prices higher  Moreover  the regulatory environment for mortgages remains challenging 
Total housing inventory of existing homes was 6 8  lower at the end of September than a year ago  per data released by the National Association of Realtors in October New home inventory for sale was 204 000 units at the end of September  a 4 5 month supply at the current sales pace  which is down from 4 6 months in August 
Rising Labor  Land and Material Costs
Rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation  going ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins considering that home price increases are moderating 
Rising land and labor costs    mainly the latter    have hurt gross margins of the likes of Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   LEN   KB Home  KBH  and D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  in the past few quarters 
Slowing Sales Trends in Texas Houston
Texas  economy is dependent on the oil complex and the volatility in the energy sectorhas in the recent past hurt the region s overall economic growth and  in turn  home sales  Though Texas  markets like Dallas and San Antonio are doing well  Houston suffered in particular  mainly at higher price points  in the wake of the oil price slide  However  lower end demand remained more or less steady in Houston 
Pulte Group  Inc  s  PHM  Texas segment accounts for around 14  of its homebuilding revenues as of Sep 30  2016  Orders declined 9  in this market in 2015 Again  Houston accounts for around 9  of Lennar s homebuilding revenues  The company s orders declined 12  in the Houston segment in fiscal 2015 and 7 5  in the first nine months of 2016 due to lower demand 
Interestingly  Pulte management said at the first as well as second quarter conference call that demand trends in Houston improved as they moved through the quarter  Meritage Homes Corporation  MTH   a smaller homebuilder  also said that its sales in Houston exceeded expectations in the first as well as second quarter  With oil prices on the rise again  demand trends could improve in Houston 
Bottom Line
In    we focused on the conditions that are expected to drive the industry going forward 
As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now   will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure in short term investors ",2016-11-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/factors-that-may-unsettle-housing-stocks-200162196,200162196

170111,391627,LEN,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Lennar  D R  Horton  Toll Brothers  KB Home And Beazer Homes USA,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   February 27  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Housing  Part 2  including Lennar Corp   NYSE         D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE         Toll Brothers  Inc   NYSE         KB Home  NYSE        and Beazer Homes USA Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Housing  Part 2

	Link  

	2016 had been reasonably good for the housing market  and this year is expected to maintain the trend  courtesy of healthy demand supply balance  modestly rising prices  historically low mortgage rates  escalating rent costs and easy availability of loans  Again  there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials  a generation that had to some extent refrained some from entering the market 

	For that matter  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and the long term 

	Below  we discuss some of the key factors driving the sector and what investors can expect going ahead 

Higher Demand  Low Inventory Boost Sales

	Steady economic growth along with favorable demographics  historically low interest rates and the attractiveness of owning versus rent are driving demand 

	Although GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 was slower than the preceding quarter  average growth in the second half of the year significantly improved from the disappointing 1 1  increase in the first half  The composition of growth in Q4 was also somewhat better than the Q3 gain  The final quarter of 2016 saw solid consumer spending  a pickup in business investments along with a rebound in home construction 

	Per the National Association of Realtors or NAR  2016 was the best year in a decade for existing home sales  even after the decline in December  courtesy of the ongoing affordability tensions and historically low supply levels 

	On the other hand  a shortage in buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is boosting new home sales and is expected to continue for some time 

	Total housing inventory of existing homes was 10 8  lower at the end of December  per data released by the NAR  This marks the lowest since the NAR began tracking housing supply in 1999  Inventory has dropped for 19 straight months  At the current sales pace  the December inventory represents a 3 6 month supply  which is down from 3 9 months in November 

Healthy Demand Supply Balance to Lift Price

	The past year saw inching up of prices every month with the largest gains coming in the later half  Although gains may decelerate to a certain extent  we expect prices to continue to ascend  The median of existing home prices in December was  232 200  up 4  from a year ago  The price hike marked the 58th consecutive month of year over year gains in the sector 

	Higher rates may impact the housing demand  However  the supply side dynamics of the U S  housing market support higher home prices 

	We believe prices will continue to scale higher despite decelerating sales growth as demand for homes is like to grow on high consumer confidence and low unemployment  Improving labor markets  declining unemployment rates  low mortgage rates and limited home supplies are driving home prices  thereby boosting homebuilders  top line 

	Although the recent bump up in interest rates has raised concerns over outlook of home prices in 2017  the rates should remain reasonable  in our view  keeping housing affordable  Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a positive for the housing sector 

	After all  the underlying driver for the higher move in interest rates is increased economic growth expectations  A booming economy boosts income as well  Thus  if the rise in income offsets the increase in mortgage payment  housing will do just fine 

	Some analysts are of the opinion that the hike largely follows the euphoria of Trump s election as U S  president  Probably  builders are hopeful that Trump will follow through on his pledge to ease some regulations that are marring housing affordability and business for small enterprises 

Trump s Growth Plan

	President Donald Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts  deregulation and higher infrastructure spending  Although this may face varied obstacles  we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2017 

	Although the U S  inched up 1 6  in 2016  down from 2 6  seen in 2015  the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2 6  from 2010 to 2015  Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and provides a basis for stronger demand 

	Meanwhile  the U S  economy added 227 000 jobs during the month of Jan 2017  significantly higher than 157 000 added last December  This also exceeds the consensus estimate of 174 000 job additions  Additionally  these are the best monthly job gains since September  Job addition is yet another signal that Trump has taken over a healthy economy 

	With a fall in the unemployment rate  rising wages and decent consumer confidence  the U S  economy looks quite strong despite rising pressure elsewhere 

Millennials Take Interest 

	Millennials  born after 1980  are anticipated to continue to make up a large and growing portion of the buyer section  although many disagree with this view  This is due to the fact that millennials occupy the largest adult generation and make up the greatest percentage of the workforce 

	According to the 2016 National Association of Realtors Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends study  millennials accounted for 35  of all buyers  up from 32  in 2014 

Land as Native Strength

	The well stocked supply of land  plots and homes of large homebuilders like Lennar Corp   NYSE         D R  Horton  Inc   NYSE        and Toll Brothers  Inc   NYSE        provide them with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters  thereby growing sales and home closings  D R  Horton carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and Toll Brothers holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  

	Toll Brothers has secured some of the most sought after urban locations in the country   New York City  Northern New Jersey  Philadelphia and Washington D C  to name a few   where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to come by 

	Interestingly  homebuilders like PulteGroup  Inc   NYSE PHM  and Lennar are moving away from a land heavy acquisition strategy to acquiring land with a shorter two  to three year average life to improve returns  Pulte also focuses on investing in land in closer in locations where demand is more sustainable  PulteGroup sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   

	Smaller homebuilders too have realized the importance of land investments to support growth  KB Home  NYSE        and Beazer Homes USA Inc   NYSE        are stepping up land investments to strengthen their position in an improving housing market 

Conclusion

	Though they admit to rising labor shortages and land labor costs  homebuilders in general expect the housing market to continue its measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth 

	Overall  the positive trends in supply and demand fundamentals have led to incredible hikes in home prices and are likely to provide some resiliency in the face of moderately rising interest rates in 2017 

	Investors could also take advantage of the opportunities in the near term and cash in on any sudden surge in the homebuilding sector

170137,391653,LEN,Housing Stands Tall Against Amid Sluggish Global Economy,opinion,"Amid a volatile U S  stock market  uncertainty surrounding the Fed rate hike  panic in the global financial markets triggered by the unexpected  Brexit  vote and unstable gasoline prices  the homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy  The market in general believes that the departure of U K  from the European Union will not have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity 
What Do the Numbers Say 
New U S  single family home sales rose an unexpected 3 1  in September from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593 000 units  This clearly indicates that the overall housing market has made quite a comeback following the August slump  Sales data for August was revised sharply down to 575 000 units from the previously reported 609 000 units  New data show a sales decline of 8 6  in August from July  Notably  July 2016 marked the best month for home sales since 2007 
Meanwhile  the overall third quarter picture is quite encouraging with new home sales  which account for a fairly small share of U S  home buying activity  scaling higher compared to the Apr Jun 2016 period  Through the first nine months of 2016  sales grew 13  year over year  That said  residential construction in the third quarter has somewhat struggled on gross domestic product   GDP   for a second straight quarter 
Meanwhile  existing home sales marked a strong rebound in September  buoyed by high first time buys  per data released by the National Association of Realtors  Sales rose 3 2  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 47 million in September from a downwardly revised 5 30 million in August     the highest in three months  All major regions registered a rise in closings in September  Notably  first time buyers accounted for 34  of September sales  higher than 31  recorded in August and 29  a year ago 
The number of building permits   a gauge of future construction   rose 6 3  in the month of September  Buoyed by new home sales  single family permits and starts improved in 2016 when compared with the preceding year  On the other hand  the building of multi family properties like apartments and condominiums slowed down in 2016 
Further  the National Housing Association of Home Builders or NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index or HMI scaled to 65 in September   the highest since Oct 2005  This reading mainly reflects builder perceptions of current single family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months  Although HMI dropped 2 points to 63 in October  it remained steady over the trailing four months 
The Overall Outlook
Despite a weak start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals 
Positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 
However  a tight labor market  limited land availability and constrained mortgage environment restrict the ability of homebuilders to quickly respond to growing demand 
Other than that  homebuilders are witnessing slowing demand trends in the Houston market due to lower consumer spending amid volatile energy prices 
Q3 Earnings Cycle
In September  homebuilders Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   LEN  and KB Home  KBH  reported better than expected results for third quarter 2016  Lennar performed impressively  beating expectations on both top and bottom lines for the third quarter in a row  KB Home s Q3 earnings surpassed analysts  expectations by 7 7  and also increased 83  year over year  Although the company failed to meet the consensus mark for revenues  the reported figure surged 8 3  on double digit growth in deliveries and housing revenues as well as improved operating margin 
Both companies recorded an increase in home deliveries and new home orders in the reported quarter  However  slower sales were recorded in the Houston market 
Among the large homebuilders  PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   Inc  s  PHM  Q3 earnings were in line with expectations while revenues missed the same  Although quarterly revenues increased 25 9  year over year  the home sales gross margin plunged 250 basis points  bps  to 21 1  in the wake of rising land and labor costs  Home deliveries and new home orders marked an increase 
Among the other major homebuilders  D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  is due to report in November while Toll Brothers  Inc   TOL  is expected to release its financial numbers in December 
A look at the table below shows that among the five large homebuilders  three hold a favorable Zacks Rank  while two carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell    which highlights a mixed outlook for the housing industry 
A look at the  does not clearly show an earnings beat for any of the homebuilders  barring D R  Horton 
Zacks Industry Rank

As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  
The Zacks Industry Rank for homebuilding is currently at  224  This is in the bottom 3rd of all industries  highlighting the group s negative outlook  Though the industry picked up pace in the third quarter  equity market volatility and labor shortage issues are dampening its prospects 
Additionally  one factor that could be dampening investors  sentiments is the possibility of an interest rate hike 
Earnings Trends 
If we look at the overall results of the Construction Industry as of Oct 28  2016  earnings grew 5 5  and total revenues rose 7 3  in the September quarter  So far in the September quarter  the sector has witnessed not so impressive earnings beat ratio  the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  of 42 9  and a revenue beat ratio of 14 3  
Overall  earnings and revenues for the quarter are expected to rise 6 1  and 7   respectively  In 2016  these are expected to improve a respective 9 7  and 5 5  
For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our    report 
Bottom Line
Despite some concerns regarding the health of the economy  homebuilders are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead  However  labor shortages  a slight slowdown in sales in Texas Houston  increasing competitive pressure and rising land and construction cost will be the headwinds to contend with

170138,391654,LEN,U S  GDP Solid  Housing To Gain More Strength ,opinion,"Home shoppers are no longer in the  Should I rent or should I buy   dilemma  Low mortgage rates  rising rent costs as well as easy availability of loans are driving the homebuilding sector 
This year  the industry experienced one of the strongest spring housing markets in a decade  Moreover  the sustained period of low mortgage rates has driven sales of homes  As measured by the National Association of Home Builders  Housing Market Index  HMI   home builder sentiment reads a  confident  figure of 63 out of 100 
With an improving economy  encouraging job numbers and affordable mortgage rates  homebuilding should gain further steam going forward  It might be a good idea for home shoppers to buy this fall or winter  rather than waiting for spring next year 
For that matter  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader housing sector over both the short and long term 
Below  we discuss some of the keys driving the sector and what investors can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Steady Economic Growth
The latest data revealing third quarter gross domestic product or GDP numbers represented a significant improvement over the first half of 2016 and the best quarterly performance in two years 
GDP increased at a 2 9  annual rate  more than double the 1 4  recorded in the second quarter  This marks the highest improvement since the second quarter of 2015  From 2010 to 2015  the U S  economy grew at an average annual rate of 2 6  
Improving economic growth supported by a better employment picture generally boosts household formations and provides a basis for stronger housing demand 
So far in 2016  the employment numbers have been fairly strong 
With a fall in the unemployment rate  rising wages and decent consumer confidence  the U S  economy looks quite strong despite rising pressure elsewhere and Brexit related economic uncertainties  The market in general believes that the departure of the U K  from the European Union will not have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity 
Rising Demand  Low Inventory Boost Sales
Steady economic growth  along with increasing household formation  favorable demographics  low interest rates and the attractiveness of owning versus rent is fueling demand 
On the other hand  a shortage of buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing  The convergence of healthy demand and low inventory levels is boosting new home sales and is expected to continue for some time 
Total housing inventory of existing homes was 6 8  lower at the end of September than a year ago  per data released by the National Association of Realtors New home inventory for sale was 204 000 units at the end of September  a 4 5 month supply at the current sales pace  which is down from 4 6 months in August 
Mortgage Rates Low  Home Price Gains Moderate
Housing was an affordable option in 2015 as mortgage rates remained near historic lows  High mortgage rates dilute the demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive  This lowers buyers  purchasing power and hurts volumes  revenues and profits of homebuilders 
According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate went down from 4 17  in 2014 to 3 85  in 2015  In 2016  the trend has been maintained with rates going down further to 3 46  in September  Even if mortgage interest rates rise with the Fed probably announcing further federal fund rate hikes later this year or the next  the rates should remain reasonable  in our view  keeping housing affordable Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a net positive for the housing sector 
Moreover  improving labor markets  falling unemployment rates  low mortgage rates and limited home supplies are supporting a continued rise in home prices  thereby boosting homebuilders  top line 
From the buyers  point of view  though home prices are rising across the country with increasing demand  the price gains are moderating 
Low mortgage rates and moderating home price gains give homebuyers much needed confidence  This in turn stokes demand 
Land as Native Strength
The well stocked supply of land  plots and homes of large homebuilders like Lennar Corp  NYSE LEN    LEN   D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  and Toll Brothers  Inc   TOL  provide them with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters  thereby growing sales and home closings 
Toll Brothers has secured some of the most sought after urban locations in the country  New York City  Northern New Jersey  Philadelphia and Washington D C  to name a few   where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to come by 
Interestingly  homebuilders like PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   Inc   PHM  and Lennar are moving away from a land heavy acquisition strategy to acquiring land with a shorter two  to three year average life to improve returns  Pulte also focuses on investing in land in closer in locations where demand is more sustainable 
Smaller homebuilders too have realized the importance of land investments to support growth  KB Home  KBH  and Beazer Homes USA Inc   BZH  are stepping up land investments to strengthen their position in an improving housing market 
Conclusion
Though they admit to rising labor shortages and land labor costs  homebuilders in general expect the housing market to continue its measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth 
Investors could also take advantage of the opportunities in the near term and cash in on any sudden surge in the homebuilding sector

Housing Stands Tall Amid Brexit and Other Commotion

Amid a volatile U S  stock market  uncertainty surrounding the Fed rate hike  panic in the global financial markets triggered by the unexpected   Brexit   vote and volatile gasoline prices  the homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy 

The market  in general  believes that the departure of U K  from the European Union will not have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity 

What Do the Numbers Say 

Though recent new home sales and housing starts slowed down slightly  the rest of the housing data   released in June   has been fairly upbeat  clearly indicating that the overall housing market remains intact 

New home sales dropped 6  in May from a more than eight year high in April U S  housing starts fell 0 3  from a revised April number to an annual rate of 1 164 000 in May due to a decline in multi family production 

The number of building permits   a gauge of future construction   rose 0 7  in May  Further  the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the home builder sentiment index  HMI  rose 2 points to 60 in June  after holding steady for the past four months  Moreover  existing home sales rose 1 8  in May   its highest pace in almost a decade  per data released by the National Association of Realtors  Construction spending touched a five year high in April 

The Overall Outlook

Despite a weak start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  The spring selling season in 2016 was better than last year  The springtime weather boosts construction activity and traffic trends 

Positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the second half of 2016 

However  a tight labor market  limited land availability and constrained mortgage environment restrict the ability of homebuilders to quickly respond to growing demand 

Other than that  homebuilders are witnessing slowing demand trends in the Houston market due to lower consumer spending trends amid volatile energy prices 

Q2 Earnings Season in Sight

Last month  two homebuilders   Lennar Corporation    and KB Home       reported better than expected second quarter results  beating estimates for both earnings and sales  Both the companies recorded a double digit increase in home deliveries and new home orders in a successful spring selling season  However  both witnessed slower sales trends in the Houston market 

Among the other large homebuilders  PulteGroup  Inc     and D R  Horton  Inc     are due to report next month while Toll Brothers  Inc     should report in August  They all expect to do well in the upcoming quarter 

A look at the  does not clearly show that any homebuilder is likely to beat expectations when it reports its next quarterly result in July August

Bottom Line

170194,391710,LEN,Brexit Unlikely To Hurt Homebuilding  But These Things Can,opinion,"Though Brexit related uncertainties and global economic pressure are not expected to have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity  there are other factors that can pull it back  Land and labor shortage has become a valid concern and so are tedious underwriting standards  And you can t wish away competition that can at times get fierce and ignore cost inflation 
It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below  we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 
Labor Land Shortages
Several years of production deficits during the housing downturn resulted in a limited supply of both rental and new homes in the country  At present  a shortage of buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing 
The labor market has tightened with limited availability arresting the rapid growth in housing production  Labor supply is expected to remain tight through the rest of the year  Also  capital constraints for land and land development have left entitled lands in short supply while increasing demand has driven land prices higher  Moreover  the regulatory environment for mortgages remains challenging 
Total housing inventory of existing homes was 5 7  lower at the end of May than a year ago  per data released by the National Association of Realtors in June New home inventory for sale was 244 000 units at the end of May  a 5 3 month supply at the current sales pace  only slightly up from April 
Rising Labor  Land and Material Costs
Rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation  going ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins considering that home price increases are moderating 
Rising land and labor costs   mainly the latter   have hurt gross margins of the likes of Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   LEN   KB Home  KBH  and D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  in the past few quarters 
Slowing Sales Trends in Texas Houston
Texas  economy is dependent on the oil complex and the volatility in the energy sectorhas in the recent past hurt the region s overall economic growth and  in turn  home sales  Though Texas  markets like Dallas and San Antonio are doing well  bucked the trend  Houston suffered in particular  mainly at higher price points  in the wake of the oil slide  However  lower end demand remained more or less steady in Houston 
Pulte Group  Inc  s  PHM  Texas segment accounts for around 15  of its homebuilding revenues  Orders declined 9  in this market in 2015 and were flat in the first quarter of 2016 Houston accounts for around 9  of Lennar s homebuilding revenues  The company s orders declined 12  in the Houston segment in fiscal 2015 and 4  in the first half of 2016 due to lower demand 
Interestingly  Pulte management said at the first quarter conference call that demand trends in Houston improved as they moved through the quarter  Meritage Homes Corporation  MTH   a smaller homebuilder  also said that its sales in Houston exceeded their expectation in the first quarter  With oil prices on the rise again  demand trends could improve in Houston 
Bottom Line
As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now   will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure in short term investors

According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate went down from 4 17  in 2014 to 3 85  in 2015  In 2016  the trend continues with rates going down further to 3 60  in May  Even if mortgage interest rates rise with the Fed probably announcing further federal fund rate hikes later this year or next  the rates should remain reasonable  in our view  keeping housing affordable Modest hikes in interest rates in the context of an improving economic environment can be a net positive for the housing sector

Moreover  improving labor markets  falling unemployment rates  low mortgage rates and a limited home supply are supporting a continued rise in home prices  thereby booting homebuilders  top line 

From the buyers  point of view  though home prices are rising across the country with increasing demand  the price gains are moderating 

Low mortgage rates and moderating home price gains give homebuyers much needed confidence  This in turn stokes demand 

Land as Native Strength

The well stocked supply of land  plots and homes of large homebuilders like Lennar Corp     and Toll Brothers  Inc      provide them with a strong competitive position to meet demand in future quarters  thereby growing sales and home closings 

Toll Brothers has secured some of the most sought after urban locations in the country  such as New York City  Northern New Jersey  Philadelphia and Washington D C   where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to come by 

Interestingly  homebuilders like PulteGroup  Inc      and Lennar are moving away from a land heavy acquisition strategy to acquiring land with a shorter two  to three year average life to improve its returns  Pulte also focuses on investing in land in closer in locations where demand is more sustainable 

Smaller homebuilders have also realized the importance of land investments to support future growth  KB Home    and Beazer Homes USA Inc      are stepping up land investments to strengthen their position in an improving housing market 

Conclusion

Though they admit to rising labor shortages and land labor costs  homebuilders in general expect the housing market to continue its measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth 

Investors could definitely take advantage of the opportunities in the near term and cash in on any sudden surge in the homebuilding sector

Chicago  IL   July 11  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Homebuilding  Part 3  including  Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN      KB Home     D R  Horton  Inc      Pulte Group  Inc       and Meritage Homes Corporation    

Industry  Homebuilding  Part 3

Link 

Though Brexit related uncertainties and global economic pressure are not expected to have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity  there are other factors that can pull it back  Land and labor shortage has become a valid concern and so are tedious underwriting standards  And you can t wish away competition that can at times get fierce and ignore cost inflation 

It would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at these dampeners before investing in this space  Below  we discuss the impact that these can have on the sector in the coming months and years 

Labor Land Shortages

Several years of production deficits during the housing downturn resulted in a limited supply of both rental and new homes in the country  At present  a shortage of buildable lots  skilled labor and available capital for smaller builders are limiting home production  thereby lowering the inventory of homes  both new and existing 

The labor market has tightened with limited availability arresting the rapid growth in housing production  Labor supply is expected to remain tight through the rest of the year  Also  capital constraints for land and land development have left entitled lands in short supply while increasing demand has driven land prices higher  Moreover  the regulatory environment for mortgages remains challenging 

Total housing inventory of existing homes was 5 7  lower at the end of May than a year ago  per data released by the National Association of Realtors in June New home inventory for sale was 244 000 units at the end of May  a 5 3 month supply at the current sales pace  only slightly up from April 

Rising Labor  Land and Material Costs

Rising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders  pricing power  Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability  There could be more inflation  going ahead  This is eating into homebuilders  margins considering that home price increases are moderating 

Rising land and labor costs   mainly the latter   have hurt gross margins of the likes of Lennar Corporation     KB Home    and D R  Horton  Inc      in the past few quarters 

Slowing Sales Trends in Texas Houston

Texas  economy is dependent on the oil complex and the volatility in the energy sectorhas in the recent past hurt the region s overall economic growth and  in turn  home sales  Though Texas  markets like Dallas and San Antonio are doing well  bucked the trend  Houston suffered in particular  mainly at higher price points  in the wake of the oil slide  However  lower end demand remained more or less steady in Houston 

Pulte Group  Inc  s      Texas segment accounts for around 15  of its homebuilding revenues  Orders declined 9  in this market in 2015 and were flat in the first quarter of 2016 Houston accounts for around 9  of Lennar s homebuilding revenues  The company s orders declined 12  in the Houston segment in fiscal 2015 and 4  in the first half of 2016 due to lower demand 

Interestingly  Pulte management said at the first quarter conference call that demand trends in Houston improved as they moved through the quarter  Meritage Homes Corporation     a smaller homebuilder  also said that its sales in Houston exceeded their expectation in the first quarter  With oil prices on the rise again  demand trends could improve in Houston 

Bottom Line

As you can see  there is some catching up to do for these homebuilders even though the economy paints a picture of recovery  But what about investing in the space right now   will the opportunities outweigh the risks to lure in short term investors 

Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now

	Economic and social dissatisfaction  especially among citizens who have received less education than their peers  are triggering moves toward more radical policy measures of government  Ergo Brexit  which is being championed by no less than the Mayor of London  In fact  Boris Johnson heads the campaign for Great Britain to leave the EU 
	If this is reminiscent of Americans supporting a more radical version of a presidential candidate in the form of Donald Trump  it probably should  The demographics of most Trump supporters in the U S  largely mirror the profile of those in Britain supporting the Leave campaign  They are now receiving support   at least philosophically  in that populist overthrows have proven healthy in countries whose institutions have been plagued by corruption  etc    from higher educated media writers and pollsters  whose results indicate we may be in a nail biter on both the Brexit referendum and Trump s presidential bid

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 91 cents on  2 60 billion  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  14 million on the top
After high double digit growth in each of the past 7 quarters  Lennar is expected to report single digit gains in the quarter to be reported
Rising land costs and slowing home price growth should continue to take its toll on gross margins
What are you expecting for  
The housing market is an often looked at as an important barometer of the health of the economy  Since the 2008 financial crisis  housing has been closely watched  recently making modest strides on its way to a full recovery 
However  with housing starts coming in lower than expected in May  a full fledged recovery might be premature  For homebuilders like Lennar  this could pose a problem this quarter and throughout the rest of the year 
Lennar is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter earnings tomorrow before the market opens  The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of 91 cents on  2 60 billion  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  14 million on the top 
Compared to a year earlier this represents a 13  increase in earnings and 8  in sales  Despite strong comparisons  the stock typically reacts negatively after an earnings report 
The company has delivered robust growth in each of the past 7 quarters and this report should make it an 8th  Lennar continues to see strong demand  momentum and volume trends in many of its key reporting segments 
Last quarter featured increases in deliveries  new orders and backlog orders  Earnings from its multifamily ventures came in at  12 2 million  compared to a loss from a year earlier 
After high double digit growth in each of the last 7 quarters  Lennar is expected to report single digit gains in Q2  Earnings from Rialto and financial services sectors have both struggled lately  coming in below expectations for the first quarter 
Gross margins have been just as bad over the past few quarters  as rising land costs and slowing home price appreciation takes its toll  Troubles in Florida and Houston areas should also keep earnings in check for the quarter to be reported

Lennar Corp  Earnings   Technicals

On Tuesday before the market opened  Lennar Corp  LEN  announced second earnings that topped analyst estimates and sent shares spiking in the premarket session  The company announced second quarter earnings of 95 cents per share on  2 75 billion in revenues while analysts were looking for earnings of 87 cents per share on  2 6 billion in revenues  The company also announced that new home orders jumped 10  in the quarter  Analysts currently have an average price target of  54 23 
Looking at the chart you will see that shares gained some momentum in the premarket session with highs hitting  48 95 after closing Monday at  46 66 equaling a 4 9  jump in value  Shares are looking to gap above the 200 day moving average that currently sits at  46 86 but are opening near a big level of resistance at  48 so we ll have to see how the price action behaves there  Look for further resistance at  49 while support will come in at  46 86 and  46 followed up by  45  Since shares were not able to hold that 200 day moving average and created a very bearish engulfing candle that consumed the entire previous days trading range that makes for a very weak chart so we ll have to see if shares can hold  46 or if they want to push lower 
CEO Comments
Stuart Miller  Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   said   We are very pleased with our second quarter results as we achieved pre tax earnings of  327 8 million  our highest second quarter pre tax earnings since 2006  The homebuilding market continued its slow and steady recovery sustained by low interest rates  modest wage growth  positive consumer confidence and low unemployment levels combined with tight inventory levels  
 As this year s spring selling season improved over last year  our second quarter new orders increased 10  to 7 962 homes year over year  while our home deliveries and home sales revenue also increased to 6 724 homes and  2 4 billion  respectively  As the recovery has continued to mature  we have remained focused on our strategy of moderating our growth rate in community count and home sales  as well as on our soft pivot land strategy  targeting land acquisitions with a shorter average life

170235,391751,LEN,Homebuilder Industry Stock Outlook   July 2016,opinion,"Housing Stands Tall Amid Brexit and Other Commotion
Amid a volatile U S  stock market  uncertainty surrounding the Fed rate hike  panic in the global financial markets triggered by the unexpected   Brexit   vote and volatile gasoline prices  the homebuilding market remains a pillar of strength for the economy 
The market  in general  believes that the departure of U K  from the European Union will not have any major impact on U S  homebuilding activity 
What Do the Numbers Say 
Though recent new home sales and housing starts slowed down slightly  the rest of the housing data   released in June   has been fairly upbeat  clearly indicating that the overall housing market remains intact 
New home sales dropped 6  in May from a more than eight year high in April U S  housing starts fell 0 3  from a revised April number to an annual rate of 1 164 000 in May due to a decline in multi family production 
The number of building permits   a gauge of future construction   rose 0 7  in May  Further  the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the home builder sentiment index  HMI  rose 2 points to 60 in June  after holding steady for the past four months  Moreover  existing home sales rose 1 8  in May   its highest pace in almost a decade  per data released by the National Association of Realtors  Construction spending touched a five year high in April 
The Overall Outlook
Despite a weak start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  The spring selling season in 2016 was better than last year  The springtime weather boosts construction activity and traffic trends 
Positives like an improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  low interest rates  positive consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the second half of 2016 
However  a tight labor market  limited land availability and constrained mortgage environment restrict the ability of homebuilders to quickly respond to growing demand 
Other than that  homebuilders are witnessing slowing demand trends in the Houston market due to lower consumer spending trends amid volatile energy prices 
Q2 Earnings Season in Sight
Last month  two homebuilders   Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   LEN  and KB Home  KBH    reported better than expected second quarter results  beating estimates for both earnings and sales  Both the companies recorded a double digit increase in home deliveries and new home orders in a successful spring selling season  However  both witnessed slower sales trends in the Houston market 
Among the other large homebuilders  PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   Inc   PHM  and D R  Horton  Inc   DHI  are due to report next month while Toll Brothers  Inc   TOL  should report in August  They all expect to do well in the upcoming quarter 
A look at the  does not clearly show that any homebuilder is likely to beat expectations when it reports its next quarterly result in July August

4 Housing Stocks to Buy on Soaring New Home Sales

New home sales hit a more than eight year high in April  crushing market expectations  Moreover  home prices surged to record levels  suggesting strong demand in the all important spring selling season 

Data released by the U S  Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development on May 24 showed that sales of new single family homes rose 16 6  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 19 000 units in April from an upwardly revised March rate of 5 31 000  The number also represents a 23 8  increase year over year 

Moreover  the median sales price jumped 9 7  year over year to  321 100 in the month   the highest since 2014  The average sales price climbed 6  to  379 800   the highest rate so far this year 

However  inventory levels have been tightening  New home inventory for sale was 243 000 units at the end of April  down 0 4  from end March  This is a 4 7 month supply at the current sales pace  down from the March level 

Shares of major homebuilders rose on robust data  A flurry of other housing data released so far this month has also been fairly upbeat  U S  housing starts rose 6 6  from a revised March number to an annual rate of 1 172 000 in April  surpassing market expectations  The number of building permits   a gauge of future construction   rose 3 6  in April  according to data released on May 17 

Further  the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  reported that the home builder sentiment index  HMI  remained flat at 58 in May for the fourth consecutive month  Moreover  existing home sales rose for the second straight month in April  per data released by the National Association of Realtors on May 20 

And to top it all  the Q1 performance across the broader construction sector was more or less better than expected  Leading homebuilders  Lennar  NYSE LEN  and KB Home   the early birds   set the tempo for the season with positive sales and earnings surprises  Other industry bigwigs like Pulte and D R  Horton also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales on the back of higher home sales  Toll Brothers  which reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 results on Tuesday  also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales 

Almost all homebuilders agree that the spring selling season was off to a good start with strong demand and traffic trends  The companies are also optimistic that the growth momentum will be sustained through the rest of the year 

Despite a weak start this year amid equity market volatility and global concerns  the construction sector seems to have recovered on the back of strong housing fundamentals  Positives like an improving economy  rising wages  favorable job outlook and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the sector s performance for the rest of 2016 

This increase in home construction not only benefits homebuilders but also spurs demand for homebuilding materials  home decoration products and other related businesses  This  in turn  boosts the growth prospects of companies manufacturing these products  They too performed generally well in Q1

170312,391828,LEN,Will Lennar Build Better Earnings This Quarter ,opinion,"Lennar  N LEN  Consumer Discretionary   Household Durables   Reports December 18  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus calls for revenue of  3 012 billion and EPS of  1 14  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates
Housing starts and building permits have significantly increased in November  pointing to a positive outlook for Lennar 
Despite the housing market recovery  the increase in interest rates  labor  and land costs will impact housing in 2016 
Lennar  a leading American building company  has consistently outperformed analyst estimates on the backs of a housing market resurgence  When Lennar reports their Q4 2015 earnings on December 18th  it is expected that the company will continue this upward trend  Over the course of 2015  the homebuilder has reported robust results  beating analysts estimates each of the past 7 quarters  For Q4 2015 earnings  the Estimize consensus calls for revenue of  3 012 billion and EPS of  1 14  slightly higher than Wall Street s estimates  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a year over year increase in revenue and EPS of 16 7  and 6 5  respectively  Lennar has not only improved from the previous year  but has trended upward each quarter of 2015  Driven by strong housing starts and building permits  the homebuilding company is poised for an encouraging end to 2015  In spite of Lennar s surprising year  housing metrics have fluctuated throughout 2015  After a strong September  housing starts plummeting in October  only to beat estimates in November  Along with an increase in housing starts  building permits surpassed analysts  expectations for November 2015  On a year over year basis  housing starts and permits increased 16 5  and 19 5  respectively from November 2014  The positive trend in housing starts and permits indicates new houses which were already in construction or near construction  A housing recovery is often a strong indicator of the real economy and for Lennar the key driver of earnings 

Unlike contractors or regionally located construction companies  Lennar operates all over the United States and has felt the effects of the weaker regions  This year  Texas has been a tale of two cities with Dallas posting strong numbers throughout 2015 and Houston falling flat  In Houston  Lennar has struggled with stagnant sales of high priced homes and slow order growth  Besides a weak Houston area  the homebuilding company may also be concerned with increases in interest rates  wages and land costs  While interest rates have risen minimally  its impact on 30 year mortgages can be profound  At the moment  the average mortgage rate is 4   however following this recent increase  mortgage rates are expected to reach 4 7  by the end of 2015  As mortgage rates increase and potential homeowners get pushed out of the market  construction and Lennar s core business could begin to slow down in 2016 
While increasing interest rates and costs may negatively impact the housing market in 2016  home starts and permits have been trending upward  pointing to a strong outlook for Lennar s Q4 2015 earnings report ",2015-12-18,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-lennar-build-better-earnings-this-quarter-376283,376283
170319,391835,LEN,Home Builders Will Surge After This Correction,opinion,"The home builder stocks have been coming under some selling pressure since the start of April  Many talking heads in the financial media are now calling the sector run as being over  Most traders know that every industry group will experience corrections  That seems to be what is happening with the home builder stocks at this time  Below I list three reasons why the sector can still trade higher after this current correction is over 

Home rental prices have increased dramatically over the past several years in the United States  Many people are now thinking that it might be cheaper to own a home instead of renting one  Obviously  property taxes and home owner insurance are two reasons why renters continue to stay in a rental property  but if rental prices continue to surge  the psychology of home ownership will start to change 
Over the past five years many hedge funds and private equity firms have bought a lot of single family homes  Leading private equity firm  The Blackstone Group  NYSE BX  was on a home buying binge until last year  Those home purchases by the Blackstone and others by institutions have taken a lot of supply off of the market  Many people that are now in the market to buy a home are starting to pay the offering price for a house  This will eventually force potential home buyers to build a home as the supply in the marketplace continues to diminish 
Another major factor that will keep the home building sector intact in the near term is the fact that interest rates are at historic lows  Currently  the rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage is around 3 80 percent  The only problem with the low interest rates is that the banks still are not lending money like they did in the past  As the banks start to ease their lending standards  expect demand for home ownership to surge 

Recently  many of the major home builder stocks such as Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  and DR Horton  NYSE DHI  have all declined sharply after reporting earnings  All of the declines in these stocks should eventually lead to another buying opportunity  Traders that want to follow the entire sector can trade and follow the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB   At this point  the ITB will have major chart support around the  24 level  which should be a major buying opportunity ",2015-04-23,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-builders-will-surge-after-this-correction-249466,249466

US New Single Family Houses Sold data is released on Tuesday morning and the figure will likely give some indication of how LEN will report on Thursday  LEN s revenues are significantly influenced by new single housing sales  LEN s  homebuilding activities primarily include the construction and sale of single family attached and detached homes to first time  move up  and active homebuyers  
Historically  Lennar Corp s revenues have been positively correlated with movements in US New Single Family Houses Sales  The graph depicted below provides a visual representation of LEN s revenues and US New Single Houses Sold data 

Estimize are predicting a 2 07  MoM growth number for US New Single Family Houses Sold in May  If correct  LEN s revenues will likely experience a continuation in positive revenue growth  The Estimize community is predicting an increase of 27  in revenues for FQ2  15 MoM 
Leading into its result  LEN is trading on a PE Ratio  TTM  of 16 62X compared to its five year average of 23 86X  The chart below displays LEN s PE Ratio  TTM  since January 2014  As it can be recognized  the stock is currently trading at discounted levels relative to its history 

The data on US New Single Family Houses Sold will likely effect the sentiment surrounding a number of stocks including Lennar and its peers PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  and DR Horton  NYSE DHI   Further  the numbers published may well be a precursor of what is expected from Lennar in terms of revenues for the FQ2  15 report  This week will be an interesting one for Lennar group  Active investors with vested interests in Lennar should pay attention to the housing data released on Tuesday and analyze Lennar s quarterly when it is published on Wednesday ",2015-06-22,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/important-week-for-lennar-group:-here’s-what-to-expect-255884,255884
170328,391844,LEN,Building A Trade In Lennar,opinion,"Home builders are feeling the most confident they have in years  Sure the Fed says that interest rates are going to start rising soon  but they will be rising off of historic lows  The double digit interest rate mortgages of the past are not likely to come back  Or at least not for many years 
And the cost of home building inputs has been falling  Timber is off nearly 40 percent from the 2013 peak and copper more than 40  from its highs  Finally  there has been ample labor force to put to work building homes as the millennials start to have families and move to the  burbs 

One company in this space  Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   has been doing quite well  And its stock price has been trending higher  The chart above shows the price action over the last 9 months  The rising trend support is shown with a series of higher lows  Since April there has been a lid on it at 53 75 and it is again approaching that level 
On a shorter basis  the stock has moved in a channel between 50 and 53 75 since mid June  The 50 level shows significance as prior resistance over the April to June timeframe  Resistance has now become support as often happens 
With the move to resistance this time  the Bollinger Bands  are opening to allow more upside  The momentum indicators are bullish  too  with the RSI moving higher in the bullish zone and the MACD crossing up  A break out to the upside will have support  And it has over 13  short interest that could fuel a short squeeze as shorts cover when the stock moves higher ",2015-08-17,Gregory W.

170350,391866,LEN,Housing  What Guidance Will Lennar Give ,opinion,"S P 500 homebuilder  Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  is scheduled to report first quarter results before Thursday s opening bell  The Estimize consensus is looking for EPS of  0 49    above Wall Street s  0 45 expectation  That would mark the third consecutive quarter of profit growth over 40   Revenues are anticipated to come in at  1 55B  just slightly higher than the Street s consensus of  1 49B  representing YoY growth of 4  

With the exception of Q2 2014  Lennar has been posting double digit    even triple digit profit growth    every quarter since Q1 2012  Despite an economic recovery that began in 2009  the housing recovery didn t really have legs until late 2012 early 2013  From Q4 2012   Q2 2013 Lennar s results were proof of this  with profit growth registering 125   200  and 190   respectively  in those three quarters 
The housing recovery continued it s run in 2014 which thus far has spilled into 2015  with some indicators still appearing mixed  The Housing Market Index which surveys the National Association of Home Builders about general economic and housing conditions came in strong throughout Lennar s Q1 reporting period  December  January and February   However  buyer traffic began to slump in February  reflecting a lack of first time buyers in the market  Many explain this decline also has to do with low levels of inventory  Home sales were much more robust than expected towards the end of 2014  stealing a share of housing inventory from the beginning of 2015  Even so  homebuilders expect a strong acceleration in new home sales this year to an annual pace of 572 000 from last year s 435 000  and even surging as high as 807 000 in 2016 

However  while there is optimism  certain indicators are still looking weak  with housing starts falling 17  in February due to winter storms in the Northeast and Midwest  something sure to be mentioned in Lennar s report tomorrow  Despite this  building permits rose 3   Mortgage applications  long a pain point for banks also rose 12  in February  over strong numbers in January  As we head into peak season for housing  we expect Lennar to share a bright outlook for the spring and summer 
In their Q4 report released in mid January  Lennar cited a dip in gross margins  and warned that 2015 margins would be squeezed by rising building costs and higher incentives  After the report  shares fell 7  but have since recovered  Lennar s stock is now up 10  for the year ",2015-03-18,Estimize,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/with-peak-housing-season-upon-us,-what-guidance-will-lennar-give-tomorro-245485",245485

170370,391886,LEN,Are We Overdue For A Homebuilding Boom ,opinion,"On its earnings call a couple of weeks ago  Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN   a home builder  made the argument that the normal pace of housing starts should be 1 5 million per year  That s roughly in line with the historical average from 1960 2000   During the housing boom  housing starts ran significantly above that pace  but ever since 2007  housing starts have been much less than 1 5 m per year   Where are we now relative to where we would have been if we had steadily built 1 5 m homes per year 
Beginning in the year 2000  if we had started houses at a pace of 1 5 million per year we would have started 21 6 million homes in the last 14 5 years   In reality  we have only started 18 6 million homes  which means that despite the early boom we are now 3 million homes below trend   We crossed from oversupply to undersupply in early 2010   If you believe that housing starts should be 1 5 m per year  then we might be overdue for some above trend housing starts numbers

170371,391887,LEN,Market Share Of Public Homebuilders To Increase ,opinion,"According to data released this morning  housing starts rebounded in July   97 000 units were started  which is 7 6  more than in July 2013   Even with July s rebound  housing starts are still far below normal levels though  and now that long term interest rates have fallen below where they were last year  the housing market could continue to strengthen 
If homebuilding activity does recover  public homebuilders could see a larger piece of the pie than they did in the last boom  It s now been 8 long years since the housing recession first started  and many of the smaller homebuilders that were around back then did not have the wherewithal to make it to the other side   As a result  public homebuilders have seen an increase in market share since 2002   Here s something that regional bank BB T had to say on its conference call a few weeks ago

 Now a lot of the  homebuilding  activity is driven by the national players and a lot of their financing is being done in the national credit markets  So you re not seeing as much of the credit expansion in the banks 

Below is a chart looking at the big three public homebuilders  share of new home sales going back to 2003     In that year  DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI   Lennar Corporation  NYSE LEN  and PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  s deliveries of new homes represented just 9 3  of aggregate new home sales   In 2013  the three combined for 14 4  of the market 
It s not very likely that we go back to bubble volumes any time soon  but with greater market share  it would take about 702k total new home sales  compared to 429k in 2013  for these three builders to get back to 2003 2007 levels of production  Unfortunately though  the market caps of all three companies are already at roughly the same levels that they were in the  03 and  07 time periods even though revenues are not

170563,392079,LEN,Now Is The Time To Consider Housing Stocks,opinion,Every spring  the same headline flashes across the screen   The housing sector is perking up and it s time to buy   As time passed  the newfound momentum invariably petered out  leading to the follow up refrain  wait  til next year   The fact that housing stocks posted solid gains in the past few quarters led me to think investors were setting up for another false dawn  Yet after parsing a range of data points coming out of the housing sector in recent weeks  it indeed looks as if housing has finally embarked on the long awaited rebound that many have been hoping for    Make no mistake  it s still a sickly sector  The fact that shares of many major players are already up solidly from their lows means that housing stocks hold little appeal to value investors  But for growth oriented investors  these stocks may be shaping up to be one of the better opportunities of the next 24 36 months    Such a bargain  Many Americans have opted to rent rather than own their homes  but that could change quickly if the economy gets a bit stronger in the next year or two  That s because homes have not been this good a deal since 1970  That s the last time the National Association of Realtors  Housing Affordability Index surged above 200  In the first quarter of 2012  it hit 205 9   Low inventories create scarcity  One thing is for sure  there are a lot fewer existing homes for sale in almost every major market  According to housingtracker com  the number of listings in the country s 20 largest metropolitan areas fell roughly 25  in the 12 months ended March  led by drops of 40  or more in Phoenix  Sacramento  Calif   and Tampa  Fla  Meanwhile  falling inventories appear to be spurring consumers into action  the markets that have had the greatest glut of unsold existing homes in the past are now showing some of the greatest gains  From March 2011 to March 2012  sales of existing homes shot up 35  in Phoenix  16  in Denver  15  in Miami and 11  in Dallas  On a nationwide basis  home sales rose another 3 4  sequentially in April  on a seasonally adjusted basis     As the supply of existing homes falls  home builders are in a better position to lure in buyers to get a closer look at newly built homes  It helps that home builders have shown a lot of restraint in the past few years  keeping construction activity at a low boil  Even as demand for new homes has been weak  the supply has been even weaker  From March  2011 to March 2012  the supply of new homes for sale by the nation s 25 largest homebuilders fell 28   And the low inventory has finally helped spur price increases in certain markets     For example  on recent conference calls  Ryland Group  NYSEW  RYL  said that prices have been boosted in 25  of the 200 housing communities it serves  PulteGroup  NYSE  PHM  said it has stopped discounting homes to expedite sales  and Meritage Homes  NYSE  MTH  has pushed through price increases on roughly two thirds of its available homes     The long climb back for prices  Housing prices have fallen so sharply in the last half decade that it could take many years to return to previous peaks  and even longer to return to inflation adjusted levels   If history is any guide  then housing prices will only slowly creep up during the next few years  and it will be the middle of the decade before more robust pricing gains will be seen  Analysts at Guggenheim Partners expect home prices to rise just 3  this year and again in 2013     Yet even that modest figure can help profit margins for home builders  Coupled with forecasts of 15  more new homes being sold this year  analysts at Guggenheim anticipate revenue for publicly traded home builders to rise nearly 20  this year    and in many instances  even greater profit growth    Lastly  it s unclear how the glut of foreclosed homes will affect the market once banks have worked through their current set of legal challenges and put homes up for sale  Currently  banks appear to be working more closely with homeowners  adjusting loans to keep them in their homes  which may limit any future foreclosure related glut  Importantly  the number of homes going into foreclosure is now falling rapidly  as April 2012 figures represent a five year low    Valuations  taking it on faith  For investors  waiting around to spot value plays in housing stocks may be futile  These stocks are up sharply from their 52 week lows and won t look like bargains based on near term results  Instead  investors will need to believe that 2012 and 2013 results are just the start of even better days to come as we head into the middle of the decade    Guggenheim Partners  for example  recently upgraded many stocks with new price targets that reflect P E  price to earnings  ratios of around 25 times projected 2013 profits  They see shares of D R  Horton  NYSE  DHI  rising from a recent  17 to  27 by that math  They also say Lennar  NYSE  LEN  could rise from the current  28 to  37  and predict Ryland Group could rise from  23 to  34    Goldman Sachs recommends MDC Holdings  NYSE  MDC   which has 30  upside to its  36 price target  It notes MDC is seeing solid demand in its markets  sports a very strong balance sheet  and offers an attractive 3 5  dividend yield     Analysts at UBS prefer Beazer Homes  NYSE  BZH   spotting more than 100  upside to their  5 50 price target  They say Beazer has the makings of a solid turnaround under new CEO Allan Merrill  who took the reins a year ago  Their target price implies a move up to just 1 1 times book value    Risks to Consider  Further gains in housing will be tied to employment trends  The economy likely needs to create an average of 150 000 jobs a month in order to provide a tailwind to housing  This Friday s monthly employment report should be closely watched by investors who are interested in home building stocks     These stocks are best pursued with 1 2 year time horizons because their outperformance relative to the S P 500 thus far in 2012 makes them vulnerable to profit taking if the market slumps further  Despite recent gains  sector share prices don t begin to reflect the profit potential of these companies if housing demand is truly solid by mid decade  The housing stocks I mentioned earlier should all be on your watchlist  BY David

170564,392080,LEN,Could Homebuilders Be The Next Bear Market Victims  ,opinion,Don t look now  but US equities are just a couple of percentage points from going negative on the year    The S P 500  which was up as much as 12 8  in early April  has given back nearly all of its 2012 gains  and considering the increasing volatility  it won t take much to push the benchmark average into the red    From a trading perspective  the accelerated decline in early June initially left a wide number of sectors extended to the downside  Stocks in these groups need a good bit of consolidation or drift before they can become good reward to risk short candidates    But the homebuilder sector offers a number of much more timely short setups  The group has just begun to break down  so most of the key stocks have not fallen to the point where they are oversold and ripe for a dead cat bounce    Moreover  institutional investors have been building exposure to the area based on a widespread perception that the business environment for homebuilders has been steadily improving  An eight month rally for the group has resulted in premium stock valuations  and chart patterns that offer plenty of space before major support levels come into play    The entire sector looks poised for a significant break  and there are a few key stocks in the group that offer particularly good reward to risk short opportunities The Rationale Behind the Rally   Before discussing the bearish scenario for homebuilders  we need to first understand why the group has traded so well for the past eight months    There are a few key factors that have helped to prop up the industry  A  where economic growth is not too hot  and not too cold  This allows the Fed to keep interest rates exceedingly low  which in turn keeps pressure on mortgage rates The combination of slow growth and low rates was just good enough to drive modest demand for residential real estate  and help soak up excess supply Reluctance from the banking industry to aggressively pursue foreclosures  It has been very clear that high foreclosure levels have pressured real estate prices   causing the banks to take heavy losses on their properties The Goldilocks environment gave the banks a bit more flexibility  and fewer foreclosures have led investors to believe that the situation is improving for homebuilders A low level of housing inventory in some markets has led to the perception that all is well for the residential real estate market  As this  states  a lack of available homes in Southern California has led to buyers making bids on properties before they are even listed Headline statistics and low interest rates have supported positive sentiment for homebuilders  driving stock prices for home construction stocks higher for the majority of the last three quarters    Unfortunately  for the bulls at least  the environment isn t quite as good as it looks  Banks may have pulled back on the number of foreclosures initiated  but that doesn t necessarily mean that homeowners are staying current on their loans    In fact  a temporary rebound in the housing market could be just the ticket to kick off a new round of foreclosures and distressed sales  as the banks take advantage of any rebound to offload more risk    But let s not get ahead of ourselves    While foreclosure rates have declined and homebuilder stocks have been relatively strong  the residential real estate market is still in a very tedious place  A recent  outlined the difficulty in extrapolating trends from the myriad of data points covering this industry  Mortgage rates are hitting new historic lows  but  contrary to conventional wisdom  pending home sales and mortgage applications have declined  At the same time  home prices are rising  2012 will be a very confusing year for consumers   says Stan Humphries  chief economist of real estate website Zillow Inc With seesawing numbers  those seeking to buy or sell property are losing perspective on whether housing is on the upswing   or still waiting to hit bottom The May payroll report threw the bulls a curveball as the number of new jobs created last month came in well below expectations  Now that employment is no longer contributing to the  muddle through  growth environment  the Goldilocks economy is slipping toward  too cold  with     Now investors have to hang their hopes on another round of quantitative easing  QE3   but Bernanke s latest comments indicate that this is somewhat of a pipe dream  at least for now     One other important statistic is that  faster than at any time since the 1950s  This may seem like a positive turn of events for housing   and from a long term perspective this statistic would argue for a more stable real estate market with healthy buyers in place    But in the short run  through the end of this year and into 2013   a falling debt level simply indicates that consumers are deleveraging  which means they are reluctant to take on the added burden of a new home complete with a new mortgage  not to mention taxes  moving expenses etc   Valuations Much More Compelling  for the Bears A year ago  the outlook for residential real estate may have been just as gloomy  but the valuations for homebuilder stocks were much different  Sentiment for the group was poor  and investors weren t willing to pay a premium considering the risk they were taking But today  homebuilders trade at much higher valuations  reflecting the rebound in sentiment    The iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction  ITB  ETF now trades with an average price to prospective earnings of roughly 27  And considering the souring economic picture  those prospective earnings are highly suspect    Looking at the valuations in terms of book value  the industry is trading at about 2 25 times book value which is also historically high    During the financial crisis  it was not uncommon to see the majority of homebuilders trading for less than book value because there was absolutely no confidence in the value of the underlying real estate holdings    Today  investors seem more than willing to not only pay for the underlying assets of these companies  but also for the prospect of improving the book value through the process of building homes and selling to new home buyers    Even during an expansion period  it would be difficult to justify paying 2 25 times book for these capital intensive businesses  But during a challenging economic period  that premium to book value looks particularly dangerous    The iShares Home Construction ETF is also trading less than 10  below its 52 week high  and is up roughly 80  from the low printed in the third quarter 2011   So from both a technical AND a fundamental perspective  home construction stocks have the potential for a very large drop    The macro picture for homebuilders as a group is certainly challenging  and we ve isolated individual names within the group that look particularly vulnerable    Below are some of the specific stocks we are interested in shorting  Lennar Corp  A   LEN  Builds single family attached and detached homes  With a focus on the middle class home buyer  Lennar is particularly vulnerable to souring national employment trends along with potential foreclosure supply issues Lennar also invests in distressed properties with the expectation of realizing a gain as economic trends improve  Another economic dip would extend the time required for these properties to yield a profit  meanwhile taxes and upkeep make distressed property a negative carry proposition The stock is trading at 1 8 times book value  and is vulnerable to a writedown of both its traditional home portfolio and the value of distressed properties LEN broke a key support level at  24 early in June on high volume  A drift back up to the 50 EMA creates an attractive short entry point Toll Brothers  TOL Toll Brothers focuses on luxury communities  Wealthy homebuyers are not as affected by national employment statistics  but are much more cognizant of financial markets  The recent decline in equity indices causes buyers in this demographic to step back and wait to see if markets will recover TOL also owns and develops golf courses and country clubs  Luxury retail stocks have been trading sharply lower as affluent consumers rein in spending  This trend doesn t bode well for TOL s additional business lines  which rely on discretionary spending from affluent consumers After hitting a new high on very light volume in late May  TOL broke down sharply with volume and volatility levels expanding rapidly  A quiet drift higher to the  26 level doesn t do much to inspire confidence Meritage Homes Corp   MTH While Meritage is classified as a national homebuilder  their activities are concentrated in the Western and Southern United States   two areas that have been particularly hard hit by real estate weakness  and areas that have been relatively slow to recover MTH also trades at a relatively high price to book ratio   an important metric when considering the potential for renewed write downs as the economic picture deteriorates It is challenging to determine an appropriate price   earnings ratio for MTH because the company posted a loss in 2011 after recording a very small profit in 2010  Analysts have been revising 2012 and 2013 estimates lower Meritage also saw a volatile stock price decline in the beginning of June  but in contrast to other homebuilders  its consolidation over the last week has been much more subdued  A new break in price would represent an attractive bear continuation setup Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice ,2012-06-12,Mercenary

recent months  as US economic data has mostly improved  and homebuilder stocks have risen Warren Buffett has been calling for a housing rebound for quite some time  and is predicting the start of a recovery in 2012  citing 1 million housing starts year as a key target of industry growth  The NAHB reported that the pace through Nov  calls for 685 000 starts in 2011  which is 98 000   16 7    higher than 2010  The Northeast jumped 41   the West rose 36   the South rose 12   and the Midwest fell 8  Fed Chairman Bernanke has also stated in a Fall 2011 speech that   Over the medium term  housing activity will stabilize and begin to grow again  if for no other reason than that ongoing population growth and household formation will ultimately demand it    A Sept  2011 Harvard University study forecasts the amount of new US household formations during the decade between 2010 and 2020 will be at least 11 8 million Toll Bros    TOL   a mid  to upscale market builder  has survived the housing crash reasonably well  and was  unexpectedly  one of the best stocks to buy in 2011 for price gains  as it rose over 7   vs  0  for the S P   TOL continues to capitalize on cheap land prices  via a combination of land purchase options and outright purchases   They ve taken substantial impairments on their existing pre crash land portfolio TOL is one of the few US homebuilder stocks who have positive earnings  however  this is still due to the use of accrued tax benefits which they ve accumulated from prior years  losses  They have tax benefits worth  104 million plus that they can still write off  as of 10 31 11   Toll Bros  also has one of the lowest debt loads in the housing industry  with a Debt Equity Ratio of  65 TOL s recent quarter EPS growth decline was due to FY 2011 s fourth quarter only including a tax expense of  0 2 million  vs  a  59 9 million net tax benefit in FY 2010 s fourth quarter  On a pre tax basis  TOL s income rose by nearly  25M   as they reported FY

move up families  empty nesters and young professionals seeking to live in or close to major cities  we have developed and are developing a number of high density  high   mid  and low rise urban

Philadelphia  Pennsylvania and its suburbs  and Leesburg  Virginia   We believe that the demographics of the move up  empty nester  active adult  age qualified and second home upscale markets will

is in line with the Northeast s housing starts gains we mentioned earlier  Toll noted that its North segment s 2011 revenue decrease was mainly due to many communities there being sold out If you feel that the US employment picture will eventually improve in 2013  and improve Toll Bros  sales and profitability along with it  TOL may be one of the best stocks to buy in 2012 for a long term speculative US housing trade  via selling cash secured puts  below TOL s current share price  There are LEAPS available   long term equity appreciation security options   which don t expire until Jan  2014  which would give these trades the benefit of time to develop The table illustrates how the put options  yields and premiums decrease  the further below TOL s current stock price the put strike price is  As always  there s a trade off between risk and reward  Although the annualized yields aren t very high on these trades  unlike dividends  you ll receive your put premium   within 3 days of selling put options  Your broker will hold a cash reserve equal to the amount of puts that you sell  times the strike price  times 100   Each options contract corresponds to 100 shares of the underlying stock    For example  selling one  13 00 put option requires a cash reserve of  1 300 00  and obligates you to potentially have to buy 100 shares of TOL at  13 00  if it falls below  13 00 before expiration in Jan  2014   Generally  most options aren t exercised until close to or at expiration  because it s usually more profitable for the option buyers to just trade the options themselves  instead of selling the underlying stock The other attraction that selling options offers is tax deferral  If you re able to let these options expire in Jan  2014  your tax bill won t be due until April 2015  So  you ll get paid up front  and have tax deferred use of the option   you receive for over 2 years  Note  You can see more info on over 30 high yield Cash Secured Puts trades in our Cash Secured Puts Table  Although Toll doesn t pay dividends  they do have a 20 million share buyback program  which they started in 2003  and greatly accelerated in 2011  The plan still has 8 786 000 shares that can be repurchased One thing to beware of in this long term speculative trade  is that there s a fair amount of short interest against TOL  and many other US homebuilders  In comparison  Lennar has a short float nearing 20   and a higher beta of 1 71 The homebuilders have had quite a runup in recent months  and TOL looks overbought on a stochastic chart  so you may be able to achieve even higher put premiums by waiting for the next pullback  when TOL s share price should decline  and its put prices rise Disclosure  Author has no positions in TOL  LEN  or DHI at the time

170619,392135,LEN, Danske Daily,opinion,Key newsStocks close unchanged in US  slightly lower in Asia  Yields fall Chinese inflation falls less than expected Fed s Beige Book shows moderate expansion Monti and Merkel focus on growth initiatives  Focus today turns to ECB meeting  Spanish bond auction and US retail sales  Sweden releases CPI Markets OvernightChinese inflation  fell a little less than expected in December to 4 1   consensus 4 0   from 4 2  in November  Food inflation stayed high at 9 1   but this may be related to seasonal  effects due to the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year holidays    see MarketWatch  We still expect Chinese inflation to fall below 3  during the coming quarters Fed s Beige Book released overnight painted a picture of an improving but still far from strong economy  The report said that  economic activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of late November through late December  and stated that most districts highlighted more favourable conditions than identified in earlier reports  The report pointed to strengthening consumer spending  but still sluggish activity in the commercial real estate market  On the labour market the Beige Book pointed to limited permanent hiring Equity markets traded in red in most of the US session yesterday but recouped the losses towards the end and closed unchanged  Home builders gained as the large home builder Lennar Corp said that revenue and margins had improved despite reporting a drop in fourth quarter earnings   Asian markets  are seeing small losses following the slightly disappointing Chinese CPI  which is denting expectations  of more aggressive policy stimulus US 10 year bond yields fell throughout the day and continued lower after the European close to trade close to 1 90  this morning  Italian yields fell yesterday with the 10 year yield falling from 7 1  to just below 7  despite rating agency Fitch expressing concern over the euro crisis saying ECB must do more to prevent  a  cataclysmic  euro collapse  Italian  Prime  Minister Mario  Monti and German  Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel met yesterday and stated that the upcoming EU Summit on 30 January should focus on how to promote growth on top of aiming to close the fiscal compact to implement more binding rules on fiscal budgets   see WSJ In FX markets EUR USD is broadly unchanged from yesterday while EUR NOK and EUR SEK traded higher late in the day  Oil prices are unchanged at USD113 per barrel  Japan plans cut in oil imports from Iran after meeting with US Treasury Secretary Geithner Global DailyFocus today   As macro data have stopped deteriorating and market sentiment has improved  we expect ECB to adopt a wait and see approach and keep the refi rate unchanged at 1   in connection with today s ECB meeting  see ECB preview  ECB on hold as the economy gradually improves  We do not expect any new non standard measures to be announced  as ECB needs more time to evaluate the impact from the 36 month LTRO introduced at the last meeting  Before ECB announces it decision  attention in the euro area will be on the outcome of Spain s bond auctions and  Italy s sales of  a 364 day bill  We expect Bank of England to leave its target for asset purchases unchanged at GBP275bn in connection with today s monetary meeting  but we suspect that  the target for asset purchases will eventually be raised in February  see  Flash Comment    BoE preview   Wait until February for more QE  The Hungarian chief negotiator Fellegi continues his discussions with IMF about conditions for reopening aidtalks and is scheduled to meet IMF Managing Director Lagarde in Washington today  In the data calendar today s most important events are retail sales and the weekly claims data in the US Fixed income markets  We believe that the risk for the rate markets going into the ECB meeting is asymmetric toward lower rates  as the market is priced for no action  Hence  if ECB delivers a surprise cut there is room for lower rates    in particular in the 1y1y segment of the EUR swap curve  This would lead to a curve steepening  If ECB stays on hold  our forecast   the impact should be limited  However  there might be a risk of disappointment in terms of risk appetite  if Mario turns out to be too hawkish  which could lead to some curve flattening  Generally  we think that risk reward is for lower rates going into the meeting  Note  that there are some interesting auctions in Spain  which is selling 2015 and 2016 bonds  In the US USD 13bn 30 year bonds are being offered FX markets  In  line with consensus we look for the ECB to keep rates unchanged at 1 0   Hence  the policy decision should have little impact on the euro and attention will be on any forward looking comments at the press conference  The sentiment is currently very euro negative as the market among other things fears that France is about to face a downgrade by S P  We doubt the ECB meeting will change the sentiment and if anything there is a risk of a more dovish ECB  which could push EUR USD well below 1 27  The BoE decision is not expected to affect Sterling  This morning we published FX Crossroads Scandi DailySwedish CPI data for December  will be released today  Despite the fact that theRiksbank actually cut the repo rate  higher short term mortgage rates are in fact expected to add to the CPI  This illustrates that the transmission mechanism  just like in Euroland  is somewhat disturbed by effects of higher short term funding costs for banks  which also translate to lending rates  However  higher mortgage rates   and some seasonal increases in food prices   are expected to be partially offset by lower clothing prices  In total we expect a 0 4  m m increase in the CPI while the y y rate drops from 2 8  to 2 5   In general we expect the inflation rate to continue to decline in the coming month ,2012-01-12,Danske

170620,392136,LEN,Expecting More From Housing,opinion,Last week I wondered if the housing sector had finally hit bottom  There s a good case for arguing  yes   although the bigger question is whether housing will be a contributor to overall economic growth  That s still a mystery in terms of timing  but the odds are looking better for the optimistic outlook  Perhaps we ll find some fresh clues in the update for January s housing starts  scheduled for release later this morning  The consensus forecast calls for a moderate increase over December  The continued rise in home builder confidence  via yesterday s  on the NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index  HMI   suggests that we should expect a recovery in housing starts   Builder confidence has doubled since September as measured by the HMI   says NAHB chairman Barry Rutenberg  a home builder  in a press release   Given the recent improvements in new home starts and the increasing number of markets included in the NAHB First American Improving Markets Index  this consistency suggests that the housing market is moving toward more sustainable growth   A  from Calculated Risk implies that the sharp rise in HMI will soon lead to a jump in housing starts   is inclined to see better days ahead on the housing front  This index of homebuilders  sentiment is still at miserably low levels  but the improvement in recent months is striking  Things have really improved on the margin  and that is what is most important not the level  but the change on the margin  This also suggests that housing starts  which rose 25  last year  are likely to continue to pick up  Housing s contribution to economic growth  GDP  can be as high as 18    The opposite effect is possible too  and we ve had a long stretch of that in recent years  But the negative influence has recently faded to something approximating a neutral state  If housing is now set to become a sustained force for growth  even at a modest level  that s just what the economy needs to keep the recovery going at this stage  The story here is that pent up demand is being freed by much easier mortgage conditions  low rates and rising employment   says Ian Shepherdson  chief U S  economist for High Frequency Economics   It s real  The stock market seems to agree  As CNBC   There s an awful lot of optimism that housing is going to turn around  The iShares Home Construction Index is up 50 percent since October  Builders like Ryland  RYL   Lennar  LEN   and PulteGroup  PHM  are at new highs  Not a lot of room for error  Indeed  housing may be on the mend  but confidence is thin that all s well  Energy prices are rising  in part thanks to the  and a  But if housing is set to become a net contributor to expansion  there s one more reason for thinking that the U S  can weather another macro storm ,2012-02-16,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/expecting-more-from-housing-114217,114217
