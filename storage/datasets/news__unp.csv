Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings  and welcome to the Union Pacific Fourth Quarter Earnings Call  At this time  all participants will be in listen only mode  A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation   Operator Instructions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded and the slides for today s presentation are available on Union Pacific s website It is now my pleasure to introduce your host  Mr  Lance Fritz  Chairman  President and CEO for Union Pacific  Mr  Fritz  you may begin Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Rob  Good morning  everybody  and welcome to Union Pacific s fourth quarter earnings conference call  With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker  Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales  Jim Vena  Chief Operating Officer  and Jennifer Hamann  our Chief Financial Officer This morning  Union Pacific is reporting 2019 fourth quarter net income of  1 4 billion or  2 02 per share  This compares to  1 6 billion or  2 12 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018  Our quarterly operating ratio came in at 59 7   a 1 9 percentage point improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  This represents a fourth quarter record and the third straight quarter with an operating ratio that starts with a 59  That s a remarkable achievement given the volume challenges we experienced in 2019 Before we go any further  I want to recognize all of our employees for their remarkable service and productivity achievements in 2019  The women and men of Union Pacific are transforming our railroad  Step change increases and car velocity and trip plan compliance while using one third fewer cars and locomotives takes ingenuity  initiative and teamwork  and the team through the implementation of Unified Plan 2020 is changing our network in fundamental ways to be safer  more reliable and more efficient With that  I ll turn it over to Kenny to provide more details on our results Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesThank you  Lance  and good morning  For the fourth quarter  our volume was down 11  primarily due to declines in premiums in the Energy business group  The decrease in volume partially offset by a 1  improvement in average revenue per car drove freight revenue to be down 10  in the quarter Let s take a closer look at the performance for each of the business groups  Starting off with Ag Products  revenue for the quarter was down 2  on a 2  decrease in volume and flat in an average revenue per car  Grain carloads were down 1   and fewer domestic shipments were partially offset by modest gains in exports  Volume for grain products was up 2   driven by an increase in ethanol from the Midwest to East Coast markets  Fertilizer and sulfur carloads were down 13   primarily due to weakness in export potash Moving on to Energy  revenue was down 25  as volume declined 20  coupled with a 6  decrease in average revenue per car related to negative mix with the loss of long haul sand volumes  Sand carloads were down 53  due to the impact of local sand as well as a slowdown in market activity  Coal and coke volume was down 25  due to a weaker market conditions resulting from lower natural gas prices and soft export demand In addition  contract changes also impacted volume in the quarter  However  on a positive note  favorable crude oil price spreads drove an increase in crude oil shipments  which was the primary driver for the 19  increase in petroleum  LPG and renewable carloads for the quarter  and we expect to see this positive trend for crude oil to continue in 2020 Industrial revenue  volume and average revenue per car were flat for the quarter  Both construction and plastic shipments have been strong in all of 2019 and continue to be favorable in the fourth quarter as well  Construction carloads increased 5   primarily driven by strong market demand in the south for rock shipments  Plastic volume increased 2  due to plant expansions but tempered due to soft domestic demand  Forest product volume decreased 8  driven by softness in the lumber and paper markets Turning to Premium  revenue for the quarter was down 14  on a 15  decrease in volume while average revenue per car improved by 1   Domestic Intermodal volume declined 8   primarily driven by an abundant truck supply coupled with softer demand during peak season  International intermodal volume was down 23  during the quarter  reflecting weak market conditions related to trade uncertainty and a challenging year over year fourth quarter comp  driven by accelerated shipments in 2018 seeking to avoid tariffs And finally  finished vehicle shipments were down 13  for the quarter  reflecting weak year over year auto sales coupled with the GM labor strike  Fourth quarter US auto sales were down approximately 1  from 2018  Strong light truck and SUV sales did not fully offset declining car demand Going forward  we will begin to report on our three business groups  Bulk  Industrial  and Premium  For 2020  in our Bulk segment  we expect coal to experience continued challenges with volume in the new year  and weather conditions will always be a factor for coal demand  However  on a positive note  we anticipate continued strength in advanced biofuel shipments and associated feedstocks due to an increase in demand  We also expect stronger beer shipments along with long term penetration growth across multiple segments of our food and refrigerated business  In addition  with the recent signing of the Phase 1 trade deal with China  we expect to see those Ag exports resume in the latter half of the year For Industrial  local sand supply will continue to further impact volume  However  we anticipate an increase in plastic shipments  driven largely by plant expansions coming online this year as well as continued strength in the construction market in the south  Additionally  we expect favorable crude oil price spreads to drive positive results for petroleum products And lastly for Premium  the US light vehicle sales forecast for 2020 is 16 7 million units  down between 2  to 3  from 2019  Consumer preference for SUVs over sedans will continue to partially offset the decline in car demand  Domestic intermodal volume is sequentially strengthening  However  we ll continue to be impacted by truck competition in the first half of 2020  From where we sit today  we expect a more balanced supply demand in the truck market by mid 2020 which supports Intermodal competitiveness during the second half of the year  We expect International Intermodal to return to nominal seasonal flows  but faces tough year over year comparisons in the first quarter due to the accelerated shipments seeking to avoid tariff increases in early 2019 As we begin 2020  I feel really good about where we re heading  Our service product has improved significantly  and the table is set for us to grow and win business with our customers  I m excited to see the benefits of an improved supply chain continue for our customers And with that  I ll now turn it over to Jim for an update on our operating performance Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerThanks  Kenny  As you ve already heard this morning  we continue to deliver strong results  which I think speaks volumes for what is possible  Our operating metrics continue to improve and  as a result  we are seeing a better service product for our customers  The team once again responded to the challenge of rightsizing our cost structure in the face of declining volumes  while also driving significant productivity  and I couldn t be more proud For example  crew starts were down 20  in the quarter and outpaced the 11  decline in carloads we experienced  This along with our Unified Plan 2020 actions drove an operating ratio of 59 7   which was outstanding  While we will continue to drive productivity  it can not come at the cost of safety  As always  safety remains our number one priority at Union Pacific Turning to Slide 11  I d now like to update you on our six key performance indicators  We continue to see significant year over year improvement in our metrics  This is a direct result of our relentless focus on improving network efficiency and service reliability as part of Unified Plan 2020  Continued improvement in asset utilization and fewer car classifications led to a 5  improvement in freight car velocity and a 13  improvement in freight car terminal dwell compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  Train speed for the fourth quarter increased 1  to 26 2 miles per hour compared to 2018 Now turning to Slide 12  continuing our trends from the third quarter  locomotive productivity improved 14  versus last year as efforts to use the fleet more efficiently enabled us to park units  As of December 31st  we had around 3 100 locomotives stored  which excludes 300 units that were either sold or retired  Driven by a 17  decrease in our force levels  workforce productivity increased 4  year over year despite the volume decrease  Car trip plan compliance improved 9 points year over year  driven by increased freight car velocity and lower dwell  demonstrating our team s commitment to delivering a consistent and reliable service product for our customers  We are pleased with our progress in 2019  and we expect to see continued improvement in our service product going forward Slide 13 highlights some of the recent network changes we have made as part of the Unified Plan 2020  We recently stopped humping cars at Davidson Yard in Fort Worth  We also reduced switching at our Settegast Yard in the Houston area and shifted the work to nearby Englewood Yard  On the third quarter earnings call  we talked about a change in Kansas City to stop humping cars at Neff Yard  Building on that change  we recently curtailed operations at Armourdale Yard and moved the work to a single location at our 18th Street Yard for the entire Kansas City complex  In addition  we continue to adjust our local operations to align with customer demand while remaining focused on delivering the quality service product  Going forward  we will continue to look for ways to reduce car touches  leading to additional terminal rationalization opportunities on our network Increasing train size remains one of our main areas of focus to utilize our existing network capacity and we are making excellent progress  By putting more product on fewer trains  we have increased train length across our system by 16  or over 1 100 feet since the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 8 200 feet in the fourth quarter of 2019  Looking forward  I expect to see continued improvement in train length through a combination of transportation plan changes and targeted capital investments that I will talk about more on the next slide In 2019  we invested approximately  3 2 billion in railroad infrastructure  Pending final approval by our Board of Directors for 2020  we are targeting base capital spending of  2 95 billion with an additional  150 million for strategic siting extensions  About 80  of our planned 2020 capital investment is repacing spending to    is replacement spending to harden our infrastructure  replace older assets and to improve the safety and resiliency of the network  We will purchase no new locomotives in 2020  although we will continue to modernize our existing fleet  Targeted freight car acquisitions will support both replacements and growth opportunities We will continue to invest in capacity projects on our network to improve productivity and operational efficiency  including investments to support the consolidation of Intermodal operations in Chicago  We also planned strategic siting expansions to increase train length capability and targeted locations  These sitings will support our efficiency    initiatives by increasing the number of long trains we can operate in each direction  thus reducing demand for crew starts  Positive train control spending will focus on interoperability testing and an enhancement to our energy management system to reduce fuel consumption To wrap up  we have made a number of changes to our operation in the last year  and the results have been tremendous  However  there are still a lot of opportunities ahead of us to further improve safety  asset utilization and network efficiency  As we move forward  look for us to continue pushing the envelope as we transform our operations  Running a safe  reliable and efficient railroad for all of our stakeholders is job one  and our team is committed to making that happen And with that  I ll turn it over to Jennifer Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jim  and good morning  Today  we re reporting fourth quarter earnings per share of  2 02 and 1 9 points of year over year improvement and our operating ratio to 59 7   This is an all time best fourth quarter operating ratio for Union Pacific and our third consecutive quarter starting with a 59 As shown on Slide 17  we received a partial insurance recovery of  40 million associated with the flooding experienced in the first half of 2019   25 million of the  40 million reduced fourth quarter operating expense  adding  0 03 of EPS to the quarter as well as helping the operating ratio by half a point  Lower year over year fuel prices favorably impacted the quarterly operating ratio by 0 2 points  although our fuel surcharge lag actually had a  0 01 negative EPS impact compared to 2018  The good news is that in the face of significant volume headwinds  we drove core margin improvement of 1 2 points in the quarter  These results are a proof statement that through our company initiatives to improve productivity  the UP team is having great success running a more efficient reliable network Looking now at our fourth quarter income statement  operating revenue totaled  5 2 billion  down 9  versus last year on an 11  volume decrease  Operating expense decreased 12  to  3 1 billion as we demonstrated our ability to be more than volume variable with our cost structure  These results net to operating income of  2 1 billion  a 5  decrease versus 2018  Below the line  other income increased 22   driven by reduced environmental and benefit plan costs  partially offset by lower real estate sale gains  Quarterly income tax expense increased 3  on a higher effective tax rate  For full year 2020  we expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 24   Although net income of  1 4 billion was down 10  versus last year  our fourth quarter earnings per share only decreased 5  to  2 02 per share as our continued share repurchase activity offset roughly half of the income impact Slide 19 provides a breakdown of our fourth quarter freight revenue  which totaled  4 9 billion  a 10  decrease versus 2018  driven primarily by an 11  volume decline  Additionally  fuel surcharge revenue had a 1  negative impact to revenue  down  125 million to  363 million  Although not able to offset the impact of volumes and fuel  the combination of our ongoing pricing actions and business mix  had a 2 5 point positive impact on our quarterly freight revenue  Consistent with our guidance throughout 2019  total dollars generated from our pricing actions for the year well exceeded our rail inflation costs As Kenny mentioned  we will begin reporting under our new business team structure at our first quarter call  In mid February  we will provide a mapping of our carload volumes to the new business groups and make available pro forma volume and revenue for prior years  At the same time  we also will start providing weekly revenue ton miles across key market segments beyond the three new business teams Slides 20 and 21 provide a summary of our fourth quarter operating expenses  Starting with compensation and benefits expense  this category decreased 18  to  1 billion  driven by a 17  workforce reduction or about 7 100 FTEs versus 2018  Our productivity initiatives  coupled with lower volumes  resulted in a 20  decrease in our train and engine workforce  while management  engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 16   Fuel expense fell 20  to  512 million as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and fewer gallons consumed through more efficient operations  And through a combination of reduced purchase transportation  lower mechanical repair costs and less contract services and materials  our purchase services and materials expense declined 9  to  531 million Turning to Slide 21  depreciation expense of  559 million increased 1  compared to 2018  Equipment and other rents of  230 million decreased 14   driven primarily by lower equipment lease expense and less volume related costs  Other expense increased 5  to  231 million as a result of increased casualty cost and higher state and local taxes  partially offset by the insurance recovery I previously mentioned  For full year 2020  we expect year over year depreciation expense to increase about 2  and other expense to be up roughly 5  Looking now at productivity  net productivity savings driven by our G55 and 0 initiatives and Unified Plan 2020 totaled approximately  215 million in the fourth quarter  These results bring our full year 2019 net productivity to  590 million  which significantly exceeded our guidance of at least  500 million and marked an all time high annual productivity savings for Union Pacific  This really is a remarkable accomplishment for the UP team  considering the backdrop we achieved this against  unprecedented flooding and a weakening demand  Technical Issues  environment Stepping back to look at full year 2019  we reported earnings per share of  8 38 a share  a 6  increase versus 2018 despite facing volume and revenue declines of 6  and 5  respectively  Importantly  as a result of the strong productivity gains I just discussed  we held operating income flat year over year at  8 6 billion  As you know  over the course of 2019  we had a number of different items that impacted our operating ratio and earnings  But  when you set all that aside  the important measure for us is improvement in our core performance  which was nearly 2 points better versus last year as we met our guidance of a sub 61  operating ratio for 2019  And we can t talk about a full year operating ratio of 60 6  without acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our workforce  These results could not have been achieved without them  so hats off to the team Turning now to cash and returns  2019 was another year of both strong cash generation and cash returns to our shareholders as free cash flow after capital investments totaled nearly  5 2 billion  resulting in a cash flow conversion rate equal to 87  of our net income  Beyond continuing our strong program of capital investment  we rewarded shareholders with two 10  dividend increases in the first and third quarters  bringing our dividend payout ratio to just over 44  as we distributed  2 6 billion  We also repurchased 35 million shares of our common stock at an all in cost of  5 8 billion  reducing our full year average share balance by 6  versus 2018  In combination  the dividends and share repurchases added up to a total of  8 4 billion of cash return to our shareholders In addition to the cash generating power of our business  we funded part of this cash return through the strength of UP s balance sheet  We ended 2019 with an all in adjusted debt balance of  27 4 billion  up  2 3 billion from year end 2018  Our solid investment grade credit rating and a very attractive rate market allowed us to issue  4 billion of new debt during 2019  partially offset by the repayment of debt maturities  With that  we finished the year at an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 5 times as we are continuing to increase our leverage position through the previously guided target of 2 7 times  while maintaining minimum credit ratings of BBB  and Baa1  Finally  our return on invested capital came in at 15   basically flat with 2018 as we stay disciplined with our capital spend in a challenging volume environment Let me close out today with our view of the year ahead  As we look to 2020  we expect to see volumes inflect to the positive side of the ledger on a full year basis  growing 1  or so overall  This view takes into account expected declines in coal and sand volumes as well as the tough year over year Intermodal comparisons that Kenny mentioned  Against this volume expectation  we will continue to pursue a pricing strategy where the dollars gained exceed our 2020 rail inflation cost  This expectation is fully supported by the great service product we are providing our customers and is integral to achieving our 2020 and long term return objectives With regard to inflation  we expect overall inflation in 2020 to be around 2  with labor inflation closer to 2 5   We also expect our workforce to be down around 8  or so on a full year basis  Coming off of a record productivity performance in 2019  we expect to yield at least another  500 million of productivity savings in 2020 as Jim and the team continue to identify and pursue efficiency savings  Together  we believe these activities should result in another strong step down in our operating ratio  And while we don t anticipate a fuel tailwind  like we experienced in 2019  we re confident in our ability to achieve a sub 60  operating ratio  In fact  we believe we should close out 2020 with a full year number that looks more like a 59 As it relates to our capital allocation  our high level guidance for capital spending  capital structure and use of free cash flow remains unchanged  The first call on cash is our capital investments  which we still expect to be less than 15  of revenue over the long term and  3 1 billion for 2020  After capital expenditures  we will continue returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends  maintaining our targeted payout ratio of 40  to 45  of earnings  And we should complete our previously announced three year plan to repurchase approximately  20 billion of shares by the end of 2020  That plan is now 70  complete  leaving about  6 billion to repurchase this year In summary  we expect positive full year volume  solid core pricing  and significant productivity gains will all contribute to another year of strong cash generation and margin improvement  We re taking another positive step forward with our operating ratio in 2020 on the path to our longer term target of a 55  operating ratio With that  I ll turn it back to Lance Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jennifer  As discussed today  we leveraged strong productivity to deliver solid fourth quarter and full year financial results  Unified Plan 2020 continues to serve as a catalyst for improved productivity and a better service product  Looking ahead to 2020  we are committed to operating a safe railroad and providing highly consistent  reliable and efficient service for our customers while focusing on opportunities to grow the business and improve margins Our strong operating performance in 2019 gives us confidence that as we attract business to our network  we will leverage it very efficiently generating strong free cash flow and improved financial results  This is going to position us to continue investing in our network and returning excess cash to our shareholders So with that  let s open up the line for your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Thank you  And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystHey  thanks  Good morning  guys Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystSo  I wanted to start on the 8  headcount reduction for the year  Just so I understand  is that an average for the full year or is that a beginning to end of year number  Just because if it s an average  it doesn t seem to really imply any additional headcount reductions from here  So I just wonder  is that the right way to think about where we are from a headcount standpoint Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Scott  This is Jennifer  Yes  that 8  is a full year average  and it does imply some further reductions from here  I think if you just rolled forward where we re at into 2020  it would be around 6  or so  So we are looking for further gains  And obviously  volumes will depend on that  and we re going to continue to try to improve our efficiency overall  but that s our view today Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  Okay  And then  on the volume outlook  so slightly positive  obviously we re starting in a deep hole  Net gas is below 2  Maybe can you just share sort of what you re assuming for coal volumes this year and what are maybe the biggest tailwinds that you see in terms of the things out there  Kenny  And then  just as we think about the OR guidance and the volume outlook    volume guidance together  what s the sensitivity to operating ratio if you think the volumes ultimately stay negative Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerKenny  why don t you take the volume question  and I ll circle back on the OR question Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  So  first of all  each of our customers have a unique decision tree that they re using when they re trying to figure out whether or not they re going to dispatch coal or they re going to go to natural gas  I can tell you that our commercial and operating team have been really dogged in sitting down with our customers and looking at ways to improve efficiencies in the supply chain  whether that s train length  whether that s cycle time  whether that s things like forecast and by day  we re doing everything we can to make sure that that supply chain is competitive When you step back and look broadly at the volume outlook  you look at the petrochem industry and the plastics that we will expect to continue to grow  There are some other things along with that that are not as large in volume like the feed stock that will help us out  We also expect continued growth in terms of the petro side of things  So  the crude oil business  and then also if the weather is favorable  the rock shipments in the south  there are still a lot of upside there and a lot of growth in the south Now  those are just the markets  And you also think about the second half of the year  there are still some positives that I m expecting will happen on the trade side  And that will not just impact positively on the Ag side during the  call it  the September time range  but also our International Intermodal side  So those are things that from a market perspective we expect to happen Having said all those things  our commercial team has a very aggressive mindset  let s say  regardless of whatever the market happens  we need to go out there and win because we have a better service product  So we re going out there  we re creating Intermodal products  we ve got a    this is all public information  We have a product where our International Intermodal business with Northern Iowa railroad and Valor Victoria on the bulk side  We re going out and securing more business based on the new service product that we have for our grain products moving west  So  you heard about the markets  and it s also good that you hear about the mindset of our commercial team Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerAnd Scott  regarding your question on the volume to topside  the impact on OR  the way we ve wired up the plan right now and what we ve shared with everybody this morning  we do expect to see some volume growth  Now  take that exactly as intended  which is  it can be very small  but we do expect it to be a plus sign  not a minus sign  And as you point out  the first part of the year is challenged  it s still got headwinds against tough comps on International Intermodal  and of course a loose truck market and natural gas pricing against coal  But when you take it all into account  you take some of the impacts that we expect to see from the recent trade deals and tightening of the truck market  we anticipate the second half looks better  All put together  it wires up for us to something like a 59  operating ratio  and that s what we re pursuing right now  Of course  there s a lot of moving parts  and it s early in the year  so we ll just continue to manage as we see the markets evolve Scott Group    Wolfe Research    AnalystAll right  Thanks for the time  guys OperatorThe next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley  Please proceed with your question Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks  Good morning  gentlemen  If I can just follow up on the last question  just    what level of truck market tightening are you really envisioning  Is it just more of a return to a normal market or is it something like a 2018 like    almost ELD like scenario given the kind of five  Phonetic  supply side catalyst we have in place Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So we re seeing some tightening occur now  and what I call it is  we do feel like we re at the floor  Again  some of the things play out with trade  We are expecting by mid 2020 to tight more  For me to put a hand on whether or not it s going to get back to normal levels  that s hard to say  But we do and talking to all of our customers and seeing some of the bankruptcies that are taking place in the market  we expect for it to certainly be a better truck environment for us to compete in Finally  just as we think about the truck market  I just want to emphasize on our Premium Intermodal network  Our service product has improved better  Customers are seeing less dwell for their commodities  We ve talked about the reduced complexities in Chicago  And so  all of those things really create a lower cost structure that gives us a lot of confidence that we can compete in the marketplace Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  And just a follow up  Now that you re kind of comfortably into the PSR process and you re like a sub 60 OR at this point  at least in 2020  what s your line of site to G55 and kind of when you guys get there and kind of what level of incremental heavy lifting do you need to get there  I mean  is that mostly a top line driven walk from this point on or do you think there s still big cost components that will get you another 4 00 or 500 basis points of OR Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerRavi  this is Jennifer  You ve heard us talk about the long term target  and I think you ve also heard us say and remember that when we first put that out there  we were not in the stages of adopting Unified Plan 2020  And so  now that we re in that  we re even more confident in our ability to get there  But we ve also talked about it in terms of kind of the three levers in terms of volume  price and productivity  And certainly what helped us to this point has been the price and productivity  We ve not had as much on the volume side  And so  with the great service product that the operating team has put together  we feel very confident about our ability to start bringing that volume on  and we ll leverage that very efficiently  But we still have obviously great productivity opportunities ahead as well  We said that we re looking to get about another  500 million here in 2020  that s off of  590 million in 2019  So  those are big numbers  and we feel very good about that  So we ll continue to press on all fronts as we move forward Ravi Shanker    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed with your question Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks  operator  Hi  Jennifer  Just    I wanted to follow up very quickly  if I could  on the headcount question because I actually didn t follow the math on that  If you just take the average levels in the fourth quarter and extrapolate that  it would translate    that itself would translate to an 8  decline in average headcount  So  I could be calculating something wrong  but if you can just offer a little bit more clarification there just given how important that is to the overall productivity on the company Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  thank you  Yeah  I mean  the headcount reductions are very important for us overall  We ll continue to push that  The math is assuming some volume improvement and that we want to leverage that very effectively  So we re going to continue to push that forward  And again  we re saying 8  plus minus is what we re looking for on a full year basis Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And just as a follow up  again I guess this question is for Jennifer  and that s really  how do we interpret just conceptually at least  500 million in net productivity  And the way I ve just always thought about it is that it s kind of like the uplift in profits that you expect in a neutral revenue environment  And I just want to ask  is that a fair way to think about it  And also  does the guidance that you re giving for 59 OR assume some drag from mix  Because if you get the  500 million plus and you overlay some revenue growth on it  I would have just assumed the OR improvement would have been better than a 59 OR  So if you can just help us think about conceptually the  500 million relative to    and kind of layering on the revenue growth on top of that Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So we think about productivity and talk to you about it  that does exclude volume  So  when we talk about being able to turn around and move to the positive side of the ledger  from a volume standpoint  that s where you start talking about incremental margins which we think could look very favorable for us  We think we ve got a great plan put together for 2020 and feel very good about the guidance that we re giving  59 OR making another very solid step forward in 2020  And we re looking to do that with not much volume and off of a 6  down year this year  So  I think it s a good move for us  next solid step down  and we ll continue to press the envelope  But we want to do it safely  reliably  continue providing a really good service product and keep moving forward  But we re not trying to meter our progress either  we re going to try to go as fast as we can Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystJim  I know you love this question  What inning are you in the PSR process Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerWell  baseball finished  so let s talk football  seeing as it s right in the middle of the real exciting part Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  What yard line are you on Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerWell  I started on the 20 yard line    or 25 yard line  and I don t think I ve hit the middle of the field yet Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  That s enough for me  Thank you very much Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerThank you  You re welcome OperatorNext question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan  Please proceed with your questions Brian Ossenbeck    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  good morning  Thanks for taking my question  Jim  maybe a more specific one on efficiency for you  How do you think about fuel as you look at the network here  You ve got longer trains  younger locomotive fleet  better horsepower management  but you haven t really seen the improvements in fuel that some of the other peers have done in Canada or even at CSX  So  what level of confidence do you think you have in that improving  And how big of a needle mover do you count on that in the next couple of years Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think fuel is an area where we can get better  We re investing this year with more locomotives that will make it even easier for us to be able to get some fuel conservation  So we did a lot of work in 2019  and we see the same sort of trend line going  Every railroad is different in their topography  but we feel that there s still money left on the table that we can save and be more fuel efficient  Bigger trains  more cars and less trains is probably the biggest way for us to get more fuel conservation  And I d be guessing on the final number  We are shooting for an improvement from last year  and we ll continue to have that Brian Ossenbeck    JPMorgan    AnalystThat pace of improvement    excuse me  starts to accelerate here  because I think you ve been 1  or 2  in the last couple of quarters  but train lengths you re up  as you mentioned  about 16  year over year  So  is this a lagging indicator or something that needs to happen with a few more things fall into place before you get some material benefit on that Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI won t change the trend line of what we ve done in 2019 as an improvement in the trend line in that low 1   1 5  sort of gain that we should be able to be more efficient on fuel  So  at this point  that s what I see for numbers Brian Ossenbeck    JPMorgan    AnalystAll right  Thanks  I guess  one on exports  Kenny  Can you just clarify what you mean on the trade deal in terms of what type of benefit you expect on the Ag side and then how you think about the export corn  which is down about half when you look at the current marketing here in the US  Thanks Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  So  the larger piece of the pie is really on the soy bean side  and that s really more of a    probably more a    call it  more of a fourth quarter type load for us  Brazil comes in during the first part of the year  but then there are some other parts of the grain that we could see a slow uptick in  As you mentioned  corn could be one of them  milo could be one of them  wheat would be one of them  I think it s too soon to tell the timing of it  We ve been talking to our customers  and a lot of traders are talking  And I d expect more clarity as we move throughout the year over the next few months  But what you need to hear is that getting the Phase 1 trade deal  we see it as a positive Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Brian  this is Lance  So  the Phase 1 trade deal essentially takes China as a headwind and sets it up to be a potential tailwind  very high level  They re committing to over doubling their purchases of US goods with a concentration in Ag and some other areas that if it comes true  or if even a large portion or even a half of it comes true  it s really nice tailwind for us going into the next couple of three years  So  there is    it just basically turns a headwind into a tailwind Brian Ossenbeck    JPMorgan    AnalystAll right  Thanks  Lance  I appreciate it Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your questions Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks  Good morning  Could you just maybe speak to the rate of OR improvement throughout the year and should we expect it to accelerate meaningfully once volumes do inflect positive since you re not currently getting all the full benefits of PSR  I guess  in other words  should second half margins be a lot better than the first half Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerJennifer Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  Allison  as you know  our margins tend to be    follow some of the seasonality  We tend to have some of our weakest    or I guess  highest ORs in first quarter improve through the year  third quarter tends to be our best margins and then they go down a bit  Some of that has to do with weather  some of that has to do with the volumes that we re moving  So  we don t see anything at this point that would fundamentally change that pattern  We re not going to guide to quarterly numbers  but that s how you could think of it Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  All right  that s helpful  And then  just another question on the productivity  I guess  first  does that include the lapping of weather and inefficiency costs that you saw in the first part of 2019  And then  Jennifer  I think you said that it does not include incrementals on volume  is that right  Because I think if I do the math and back out productivity  it seems to imply low teens incrementals on sort of what I d call organic growth  and normally you do much higher than that  so if you could help us and walk through that  Thank you Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo  to the last part of the question about productivity  I think we said that that excludes volumes  And so  if you put volume on top of that  that helps us drive much better incrementals as we move through the year  So  I think that    what was the first part of your question again there Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystDoes the  500 million include lapping of the weather and inefficiency costs from the first half of 2019 Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  yes Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  It starts from scratch Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it starts from scratch  Right  right Allison Landry    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorThe next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America  Please proceed with your question Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning  And Jim  nice job on the continued improvements or team  I guess  but maybe just digging  I m still a little confused by some of the answers upfront  If volumes are up and you re getting pricing    core pricing gains  it seems like you re targeting a flat employee absolute number given the 8  decline  which would make    I guess  if you re looking for volumes to increase  maybe that s the flow through And then  given the productivity savings  the math would seem to suggest a larger operating ratio improvement  Is there may be a larger mix negative impact that we re looking at  Then    and maybe  Kenny  you can dig into the coal impact  I don t know  maybe it s more export    loss of export tonnage or contract losses or anything on the domestic side Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Ken  this is Lance  And I ll start by just making sure we lay a crystal clear expectation of ourselves in 2020  And that is  we expect  as part of the  500 million in productivity  to have both carryover productivity  which is some of the head count question that you re asking about as well as incremental productivity  If our volume is flat this year  we re going to have incremental employee productivity  If our volume grows  we will not add back resources at the same pace that we will grow Now we re expecting growth to be pretty minor  I think is probably the right word  and it s largely second half  So  we re building kind of a cautious plan that gives us flexibility depending on what actually occurs as the year progresses  So I just want to be crystal clear about that  There is    we re sharing with you what we re comfortable sharing at this point  but the expectation is continued productivity  some carryover  more realized through action  and we ve got plenty of actions up against that Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerRight  And building off that  I mean  our head count of 8  plus minus really is somewhat dependent on what happens with volumes  But again  we feel confident in our ability to drive the productivity  and I think you ve seen us do that this year as the volumes have fallen off  We have been very aggressive in terms of the actions that we ve taken  And so  again  to Lance s point  we feel good about the plan  but there is    we re sitting here on January 23rd  there is a lot of the year left in front of us  and we ll take the actions that we need to take  but we re bullish about the opportunities  particularly as we look to see some volume return to us in the back half of 2020 Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesThe only thing I ll add  I think you were asking about export coal  and we ve said this publicly before  it s a smaller percentage of our    coal book is less than 10   but yes  it has been impacting our export  Coal has been impacted  We ll wait to see what happens with both the weather and natural gas  Natural gas plays a much larger role and how our customers are going to decided on what they want to do with coal Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystKenny  if I could just get my follow up with you  If the International intermodal was down 23   significantly more than the West Coast markets noted  is that share shift lots of contracts  Is there anything you want to highlight  I guess  as we look to balance that out Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  we actually had tougher comps  I mean if you think    if you go back to the 2018  the fourth quarter  we had a really strong quarter and so now what you re seeing is just the comps  and we should lap that here in the first quarter of this year  I mean  the first quarter of this year Ken Hoexter    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS  Please proceed with your question Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystYeah  good morning  Wanted to    this is a question for Jim  When I think about the    you had a tremendous pace of cost take out and network improvement  how would you think about the duration of the big cost saves and network improvement  Is this a three year program that you ll still have a lot left to do in 2021 or is it something where you really capture    you get from the 25 yard line to the    into the end zone in 2020  So just wondered if you could offer some thoughts on that and then also perhaps what the really big buckets are that are left for network productivity Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerHey Tom  thanks for the question  So if we think about this  I ve been doing this for way to long  so you never ever stop looking for productivity again  You always look for what you could do to make the place better  So  the team delivered a great 2019  I give everybody at Union Pacific  a lot of credit with what we were able to deliver  but that s behind us So moving forward  We have projects that are short term  So we have projects across the entire Company that will help us to be able to deliver more productivity  Specifically  we have also some projects that will take a while  We announced the over  100 million being spent on sidings  We don t expect to get them in the early part of the year  They ll be later and into next year  So the productivity gains are this year  we see    we have to deliver on that  500 million that we ve guided to  and that means across the board and we see some more coming in the following years  I ve never ever in my career  have I gone out somewhere and not found a way to make it a little bit better and improved  So I don t see it and in this year  but there is a big bucket this year  and then it will get a little tougher as the time goes on Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystAre there particular areas that stand out  if it s train link with some of the further siding investments is the big lever or a lot left on product    I guess  terminal productivity and some of the changes with the hump yards or what would stand out as being the greatest remaining opportunities Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerTrain length is real important  absolutely train length is one that we have to deliver on  We think that we can make the terminals even more efficient  so we turn the cars quicker and it helps the whole fleet  We ve got plans to put the intermodal terminals together in Chicago from six down to three  that helps us in the efficiency  The way we handle our locomotives  I think we re not going to get rid of another 2 000 locomotives  We re only running out with just over 3 000 locomotives now  But we think there s gains there  There s gains on how we repair cars  There is repair on    there is money on gains on how we move our people around the network  the balancing of the network  there is a long list  I could go through and spend an hour taking you through it  but I m very excited with what we have on the table for this year Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystOkay  great  So  just one last short follow up I think a number of the questions on the call are focused on elements of your guidance  At the end of the day  it does feel like the guidance is somewhat conservative in terms of what you can do on the cost side and putting together some of the pieces  Do you think it s fair for us to take away from the framework that there is an element of conservatism in the guide Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I ll start and say Tom that  it s very early  Typically our confidence in the guidance we gave at the first part of the years and we build our plan appropriately  And then what you ve seen from us over years as we react as the year is progressing as things change  and universally we know how to get productivity  And we re demonstrating we know how to generate an excellent service product  One of the things we ve got to demonstrate this year is growing with that service product  Part of Kenny and the commercial team  they re going to have to learn what the network is capable of and how to sell those products and get customers signed up for it Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And I would just say  to add on to what Lance said there  59 OR for us would be a new record level for us  It s an area that we ve not gotten to  And so  we re going to continue to push the envelope and go as far as we can  But we felt good about the performance that we had this year  but we got there a lot differently than the way we thought we did  When you think about the fact that we came into the year thinking we were going to have a couple of points of volume growth and ended up down 6   we certainly didn t anticipate the weather events that we encountered  So  to Lance s point  we re going to be very diligent about working hard to pull all the levers that we can and be aggressive to make improvements Tom Wadewitz    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thanks for the time Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  hi  Good morning  Just two questions  Just back on the Ag real quickly  can you talk a little bit about how much the export Ag businesses to your total Ag franchise  And then  maybe just to give some sense  what was the adverse impact from exports in 2019 Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  I d tell you that if you look at our grain business  it s a significant piece  I tell you it s anywhere from a third to call it 40   What was the second part of your question Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystReally just how much was that business  let s say  down given the tariff issues in 2019 Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesI d call it easily over half  I call it easily over half Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThose impacts  Jordan  that s on  basically China getting out of purchasing US soybeans and going down to Brazil  DDGs  which have been on again  off again were off for a fair period of time  and it impacted even a little bit of corn  a little bit of wheat  So  the impact on export grain and grain products was  it was pretty broad Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystBy half Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesAnd the only thing I ll add  Jordan  is that really we would see it also open up the imports on the International intermodal side  I mean that has a pretty sizable improvement of volume growth there too  So just keep that in mind too Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo by half  you sort of mean half of the total decline in agriculture  or I m just didn t know what half meant Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesThere is a lot of upside here for us going forward on the Ag side  and we re going to do everything we do to take advantage of it Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  And then  just one other question  just on the    thinking about the volumes in 2020  how much of the  call it  1  volume outlook  give or take  is tied to intermodal recovery  whether it d be domestic or international  just trying to get a sense for how big a part of the volume story is related to your views on intermodal Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Jordan  this is Lance  I don t think we put a fine point on exactly what volume is going to look like next year  But let s walk you through what needs to happen to have volume growth occur  In intermodal  we need International intermodal to get back to normal  where US consumers feel healthy in their consuming  and it s coming in off West Coast ports  that s important to us  Domestic intermodal  we need both consumers to feel good  we need the truck market to tighten up a bit  So  the competitive mode isn t quite as price aggressive and loose as they are right now  We need the trade deal to have a real impact on agricultural exports and imports We need manufacturers in the industrial economy in the US to gain a little bit more confidence and get their feet back under them in terms of capital investment and risk taking  And then  we continue    continuation of what s going on in the petrochem industry from the standpoint of good feedstocks to make US the cost    low cost competitor for plastics manufacturing and finding markets for that plastic  So there is a lot of moving parts there  it s not one thing  and of course those moving parts will change over the course of the year Jordan Alliger    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thank you very much Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi  Please proceed with your questions Chris Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystYeah  thanks  Good morning  There s been a lot of questions about sort of the guidance  And I guess  maybe just wanted to think about it this way  When you think about 2020 and your expectations  if you were to see sort of upside to that  where do you think the most likely sort of places that would come from  or is it more volume stuff  maybe it s a little bit less in your control or maybe is it a little bit more productivity or things that Jim is doing within the network  So it s a little bit more on your control  I just want to get a sense  we do see upside to the guidance is sort of where you think it s more likely to be coming from Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Chris  great question and thank you  So the way I think about it is  if I could just invent the year that I would love to have in 2020  it would have a stronger upside  it would be a great mix  If I could magically make it happen  I d like to see frac sand come back stronger  I d like to see natural gas to go to  3 50 or  4 and take some of the pressure off coal  And I d really like to    Kenny hears this every day  but I d really like to see and experience the commercial team just relentlessly selling the new service product  and they re getting a lot of traction quickly on convincing our customers that it s got staying power  and what it means to their supply chains and being built deeply into their supply chains  That would tee up a pretty sweet year on   From the productivity side of the world  I have all the confidence in the world that our operating team  Jim  Tom  they re going after it as hard and strong as they can  and it would be a blessing to have more top line to work with Chris Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Okay  that s helpful  I appreciate that color  And then  if I could just ask a question  I guess  on price and mix and appreciate that the core pricing numbers are not going to be reported anymore  But when you think about some of the moving parts  I guess  sequentially from 3Q to 4Q just to help us a little bit in terms of what the pricing environment might actually look like today  I appreciate your comments about what you think about the truckload market  Kenny s comments about how that might change as the year goes on  But from 3Q to 4Q  can you give us a little bit of color directionally how things were kind of moving from a price mix perspective Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  I ll tell you  You ve got formidable competitors on the truck side  And then  as I mentioned before  we do see that    look    feels like it s bottoming out  We are expecting that to improve  You got to remember  we re coming from a third quarter to fourth quarter  where we had improved service product  better dwell  stronger AAA compliant  And so we really inserted that into part of our value proposition  So  regardless of the competitive forces out there  we want to make sure that we are pricing the product to the value that we re providing Chris Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Anything on mix from one quarter to the next Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerJennifer Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think it was slightly positive year over year  When you think about    in particular  although we had    coal was certainly down  but the intermodal piece was down significantly as well  So  a little bit positive Chris Wetherbee    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  thank you very much  Appreciate it Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome  Chris OperatorThe next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystYeah  thanks very much  So  going back to volume  I know  Kenny  there has been quite a few swing factors and significant swing factors in your individual line items  I mean  coal was down  but intermodal minus 23   And when you give your guidance here  we see a bunch of question marks in areas where there has been quite a bit of volatility  Obviously you haven t put question marks in your model when you came over with your plus 1  volume  So I m just trying to get a little bit of sense just directionally on what you re assuming in  say  your coal Ag and intermodal  given how big those are an impact in your overall volume On the eastern rails  for example  I mean they re guiding minus 15  revenue here in coal  Obviously you ll be a little less than that  but is a high single digit decline in your coal business  a reasonable bogey for 2020  Intermodal  like you said  I mean  it was down 23   it s going to have a tough comp in the first quarter  but again are you projecting mid to high single digit recovery  Is there some way to quantify  so we can gauge when we go back to investors and say  look  Union Pacific has plus 1  volume growth and it s predicated on a few things like this  which gives us confidence or lack of confidence  just right at this point  with the question mark next to those line items  it gives us a little bit of uncertainty as to what your    what your plus 1  imply Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWalter  this is Jennifer  I m going just kind of reiterate our volume guidance and then let Kenny talk about the markets a little bit  So we said that we expect  on a full year basis  to get to the positive side of the ledger  We didn t say plus 1   we said just get to the positive side  but we are going to have    that is    that does mean we re going to have to offset the declines in coal  frac sand  and then a tough start to the year with the year over year comparisons relative to intermodal  So  we haven t sized any of those things in terms of what the level of declines are and we re not going to  but that s all kind of in that mosaic that we put together to give you that guidance that we are looking to inflect positive on a full year basis So  Kenny Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesWe certainly feel the challenges with the low natural gas  Today  again  we re three weeks into the month    three weeks into the year  I think it s premature to really look out ahead on what s going to happen there  Setting aside the Ag and their Intermodal business  again  in terms of a timing perspective  the expectation is that the truck capacity should tighten up by mid 2020  and the expectation is that from a trade perspective things should get better for us in the second half of the year Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  understood  And coming back on the OR and I understand the 55  long term target  but investors are pushing back a lot now on long term targets as something to not put a lot of stock in  But clearly  Jim  you ve done a tremendous amount of work here  The data look very  very positive and made a volume environment that to say challenging is an understatement  And so  if we were to see a normalization  is it fair to say that within the next two years  we could see  again  a normalization in 2020  could we see within a two year time frame you hitting those  long term OR targets  Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Walter  The question of when 55  happens has a fair amount of moving parts  which is why at this point  we haven t put a stake in the ground and say we think it s    this date certain  We continue to work to try to understand that ourselves and build a model and scenarios that we believe in  that get the path there  But just stepping back and just thinking broadly about it  things that help would be favorable mix  more volume growth  I have a lot of confidence  all the confidence in the world in our ability to generate productivity and a great service product regardless of what the environment looks like and then making sure we have a pricing environment  right We constantly talk about those three levers to pull  and there is a lot of moving parts on those three levers being volume  price and productivity  Certainly productivity is going to get tougher and tougher as we get closer and closer to that 55   And we re making a hell of a step  we made a hell of a step in 2019  and we re signing up for another good strong step in 2020  And I think over time  it will become a little more clear to us Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystDo you think  Lance  if you    halfway through the year  you get some more visibility to put a stake in that time frame  halfway through the year when you get a little bit more data points to work with Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWalter  we re closer to that time than we were this time last year  And you and the rest of our investors and analysts will be the first to know when we re ready to put a stake in the ground Walter Spracklin    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystAppreciate it  Okay  Thank you very much OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company  Please proceed with your question Jason Seidl    Cowen and Company    AnalystThank you  operator  Good morning  everybody  Jim  I just wanted to check in on sort of how you re viewing operational performance versus the volumes that are coming through on the network  especially as we look into the back half of the year  When some of your businesses might inflex specifically domestic intermodal given your views on the truck market and sort of your year over year comps  Should we look at the network being slightly more challenged in 2H  20 Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerNo  I don t see any challenge  That s the best thing that could happen is  we ve given Kenny and the whole marketing team a service product that allows them to sell  be able to go out there and whatever the market can give  we should be able to win and we want to win with our customers  So as they come on and we see a volume increase  that s the best thing that could happen  In fact  an increase in business allows us to use the same trains with more railcars on it  It allows us to move things  There is some  of course  always  if it s a unit train business that comes on  You have to put new trains on  but we do everything we can to run them on manifest and intermodal train  So I d be very excited  If the market gave us a strong growth  We d put it on the same trains and you d see incremental savings in our cost structure for the amount of revenue we bring in  So that would be the perfect scenario for us Jason Seidl    Cowen and Company    AnalystI ll knock on wood for that  then I have a follow up question  My follow up question is going to be for Kenny  Kenny  how do you view the shift we ve seen in some global supply chains with the trade war  We ve seen a lot come back to North America in general  Mexico  and then we ve seen some go to Southeast Asia  how should we think about that impacting volumes from here on out Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesWell  ideally that would be short lived  some of the products that s originating in Southeast Asia  as you know  a lot of that is going into the East Coast  So what a stronger trade agreement  we d expect more to come back to the West Coast  I can tell you that we have really good engagement across the supply chain  starting with the International intermodal folks to make the West Coast ports in the US more competitive and will continue to do that Jason Seidl    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  Appreciate the color and time as always everyone Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesThank you OperatorNext question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein  Please proceed with your questions David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks for taking the time  I do have a longer term question on cost and then I want to have a follow up as well  If you think about the business being down about some 20  in revenue ton miles in the last five years or so  When you guys think about nominal cost inflation to this 2  to 2 5  range  is it right to think that the effective cost on the unit level for the business is a little bit higher as the base of business shrinks with the decline of coal or is that not the right way to think about the fixed cost leverage in the business Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo David  you re talking about on a revenue ton mile basis  how should we think about our cost structure  I mean  one of our challenges that we put to the team every year is that we want to offset inflation  But when you have some of your higher RTM  I think this is where you re getting to your heavier tonnage volumes falling away from you That does make it harder for the team to be able to keep up with that  but I think that s the great power of the UP franchise is the productivity that we ve been able to drive in the work that s under way  quite frankly to get better at that and to be even much more diligent with that  And actually  wait can be a help to us as we try to build those longer trains  It s going to improve our fuel efficiency David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystWell  I guess kind of more from an effective cost inflation perspective right  does the remaining traffic on the network have a little bit more burden to pay for every year or is that not the right way to think about it Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerClearly  we are a significant fixed cost business  And what we ve demonstrated in long term variable cost  there are different pieces that have different lives in terms of being able to adjust up or down  So  in an environment that you just mapped out  which is the one we ve lived the last five years  if volumes going down and it s going down in dramatic fashion  it is hard to keep up  I think  one of the reasons that we re praising our employee base and the team so much on this call is that they ve done a hell of a job in a pretty difficult volume environment  eking out productivity even in the fourth quarter being a great example  You got volumes down double digit percent  and yet we generated what a couple of hundred million dollars in productivity in the quarter David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystOkay  And then maybe just as a follow up  Jennifer  if you look at your core or your mix price on the revenue side and they re being up 2 5  it looks like there s a pretty big mix tailwind because you re declines were in your lower RPU traffic  Does that imply like a smaller contribution from core price in the fourth quarter or is that not the right way to read that slide Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  I think we got a similar question earlier  mix was slightly positive in the quarter  but not a significant driver of that number David Vernon    Sanford C  Bernstein    AnalystAll right  Thanks  guys OperatorThe next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens  Please proceed with your question Justin Long    Stephens  Inc     AnalystThanks and good morning  So  on capex  you gave the guidance for this year  but I wanted to get your updated thoughts on capex longer term  If we re in this period where we start transitioning to a volume growth environment over the next several years  is there now enough capacity in the system to where you can hold capex relatively steady on an absolute basis as we look at kind of 2021 and maybe just over the next several years Amit Mehrotra    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  So  I ll start off and then  Jim  I want to chime in as well  But the great power that we re seeing through our Unified Plan 2020 implementation is through the idling of hump yards  closing terminals and other facilities  we are creating latent capacity in our network that we would hope to be able to deploy again as the volumes come back  So  to your point  we do see kind of a structural down shift that we re able to enjoy for some period relative to our capital expenditures  And when you think about the number of locomotives that we have idle  the freight cars we have parked  that s capacity that we re anxious to deploy again and to be able to use in the marketplace  So I think you re thinking about it right  but Jim  you might want to have some additional comment Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerWell  Jennifer  I think you hit the high spots  What we re doing is this  we re able to run the capacity  If you look at the capacity in the railroad  we re going to spend some money targeted to make sure that we can operate the trains more efficiently in places where we think we can lengthen the size of the train  But on most of the network  this network is built so that we can handle more traffic  I do not see see big investments in locomotives  of course  We ve got lots of them parked  I don t see a big investment in railcars would turn them faster  but is there going to be some targeted investments that we need for growth and for customer and just cars that are getting old  Absolutely  keep the place current sustainable over the long term  So  I don t see anything on the railroad where we need to worry about spending capital to make it more efficient or worried about some business coming on  That s the best thing that could happen  and we ll continue to spend capital with the projects that we ve announced Going down and building change in the intermodal franchise in Houston  in Chicago and stay tuned  we ll announce some more  We are going to spend capital on those to make ourselves more efficient to have a better service product  So  it s a great place to be  We ve got lots of capacity  let s bring the business on Justin Long    Stephens  Inc     AnalystThanks  That s helpful  And as a follow up  I may have missed your answer to this on the coal outlook for 2020  I know you expect it to be down  but is there just kind of a rough sense you can give us on the order of magnitude and I think last year    around the beginning of the year  you lost a coal contract  is there any way to frame up  how much of a headwind that was in 2019 and exactly when you start to lap that Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerKenny Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  Again  I mentioned this  I believe this is a little bit too early to go in and say what s going to happen out there  three weeks in  Yes  we did lap the contract or we will lap that contract here this year on the coal side Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  being clear that contract loss was lapped at the end of last year   Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesCorrect Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo this    we are now fresh ground Justin Long    Stephens  Inc     AnalystAnd is there any way to size that up in terms of carloads and what that headwind look like in 2019 Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  we re not going to size that up  but what we ve expect out of coal this year is  it s starting up pretty challenging  If natural gas stays at the  2 and  2 25 level  this is going to be a tough year Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesOkay  makes sense  I ll leave it at that  Thanks for the time OperatorNext question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystHey  Good morning  everyone  Apologies  I missed the first part of this call  But I guess I wanted to follow up on that last line of questioning  Jim  specifically with your prior employer  we saw a lot of growth in the past decade on the network  whereas Union Pacific  and I know there were some specific headwinds in the coal book and what have you  but I guess    really this question is for Lance or Jim  What is specifically changing on the marketing or the sales front that you think you could reengage your customer base to actually drive some tonnage and revenue growth through the network Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So I ll start  and let s break growth into two pieces  One is  what are the markets like  What s the ground and the environment in which you re competing  And for us  as we look into this year  we think  broadly speaking  the markets start getting a little better  right  Significant tailwinds like in trade  like a soft truck market  like the pull ahead to try to avoid tariffs in international intermodal  those things start abating and lapping  and so that should create a better environment for us to compete in Second part of that question is controlling our own destiny  And from that perspective  our commercial team historically has had an excellent relationship with their customer base  It s indicative of how we ve implemented Unified Plan 2020  right  At the very beginning  we said  our goal isn t to break a lot of glass and alienate our customer base so that we have to come back around and go on a charm offensive  Our intent was  we re going to take our customers along for the ride and keep them well informed and help them see how the changes that we re asking them to go through  as well as we re taking ourselves through create a much better and much more reliable service product  that has recurred  That s in the process of recurring  and now our commercial team is taking that and turning it into new business  like the business Kenny mentioned up in Northeast Iowa  where we ve got a intermodal service product up the the West Coast  that two years ago would have never happened  and now it s generating very attractive volumes  The same is true in the agricultural markets  the same is going to be true across our book Kenny Rocker    Executive Vice President  Marketing and SalesYeah  the only thing I ll add  I could write off a few things  and I want to just walk you through it  Again  the service product has improved  That s on tighter standards that we ve got a tougher grade now for the customer  The containers are being used more efficiently  because the container dwell has gone down  We ve also inserted technology into our network  in our intermodal terminal reservation system so they get clearer visibility of when they re going to get their container  when they can expect it  We reduced complexity out there in the network  Jim talked about Chicago and alluded to Houston out there  We ve talked about Santa Teresa in the past and the fact that on an intermodal network  we expect to do a lot of block swaps there  So  really critically being transformative here on the product Brandon Oglenski    Barclays    AnalystThank you Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Brandon OperatorThe next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question Allison Poliniak    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystHi  guys  Good morning  Can we just go to the capital capex conversation you guys were having before  Just in terms  if you think about it  it sounds like there is a more of a targeted capex approach with the projects that you re implementing  Your line of sight over the next few years with the projects  is this a sustainable level of base capital  I mean  should we expect a downward trend to that number over time  just any thoughts there Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerLet me step into that Allison  So  we ve always been targeted in our capital  And by that I mean  the very first thing we layer in is what s it take to keep the doors open  that s replacement capital  and for us this year on the track side it s  1 85 billion ish and there is a little bit more when you look over into the equipment side  And then  from that point  we ve got to take care of mandates like PTC and then we look for opportunity to invest where either there is targeted capital for growth or targeted capital for a service product enhancement  which ultimately is growth or productivity  And so everything that s in the capital plan is built like that  It gets our first call on our cash and we are very comfortable that the level we re spending right now is an appropriate level  sub 15  of our revenue  and I don t really see that changing as we look forward Allison Poliniak    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGreat  And then  just going back to the operating  you highlighted a number of operating levers that you can still pull here  Not that any of them are easy  but which ones do you start to see becoming more challenging in 2020  just based on the improvements you ve made thus far Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  you know what  it s always difficult to make big change  but I don t see any of them  We ve got a line of sight what we need to do  I think we are going to deliver on those    all those items that I listed off earlier on in the call  And I don t see anything impacting us where we are not going to be able to deliver  It s    we see line of sight  we know what we have to do  We ve got the right people that can make sure we deliver it  and I m looking forward to just and we re doing it in a nice smart measured way so that we don t impact our service  So  I don t see anything really holding us up Allison Poliniak    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGreat  thank you Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jairam Nathan with Daiwa  Please proceed with your question Jairam Nathan    Daiwa Capital Markets    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions  This is Jairam  So I just    I just noticed that there was a lot of talk about safety in your comments  And if I look at other expenses  they were up about 5  and talked about increased casualty costs and expecting another 5  increase this year  Are you kind of expecting a similar casualty number or should we see some benefits from the focus on safety Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  this is Jennifer  No  we are absolutely focused on safety  as you said  and we are not expecting a similar level of casualty cost  We absolutely believe we ll be much better in 2020  What that 5  up guidance includes is higher state and local taxes primarily  which is we    as we become more profitable  those taxes go up Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI ll add on safety  because I think it s really important that we talk about it for a minute  and I appreciate the question  So  key foundation for a railroad in the industry and what we    what we do every day is safety  We are not happy with where we are overall  Our goal is to be the most    the best most efficient railroad in North America  and that includes in safety  So  we ve got lots of positives that we see on one side of it  but on the other side of how we handle and the measure safety  we need to get better  and we re working hard  We ve seen the trend line get better at the end of the year  and I would expect us to continue that this year  Our goal is to be the best railroad in North America  and that includes the best in safety  So that s what we re working toward Jairam Nathan    Daiwa Capital Markets    AnalystAgain  just as a follow up  with the USMCA passing  do you see any    has that    do you see any changes in the near term and how does that impact 2020 volume Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So with the passing of USMCA  it does take a little bit of a headwind and turn it into a tailwind  It was mostly about uncertainty and risk taking and where investment was occurring  So  I would anticipate that ll have a kind of a long term slow positive impact on our overall volumes Jairam Nathan    Daiwa Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  That s all I have OperatorOur next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities  Please proceed with your questions Cherilyn Radbourne    TD Securities    AnalystThanks very much  Good morning  Just a couple of quick ones from me  On the locomotives that you ve got in storage  historically Union Pacific has maintained surge fleet  So  just curious for your thoughts on what size you might need in terms of a surge fleet and whether you would plan to start returning or selling the balance of those locomotives Jim Vena    Chief Operating OfficerWell  two things  and Jennifer can jump in any time  I think if we can find a buyer for some of the locomotives that we got excess  we were able to dispose off some  we would do that  And as far as a surge fleet  Cherilyn  it all comes down to    we ve got a number of locomotives in normal status  so we could just go turn the switch  fuel them up and start running them  So  as if we needed to put them back in service  it d be pretty easy task and we re talking in the hundreds of that number  So that s the surge  It s sitting there  ready to go Jennifer Hamann    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  And just to highlight  Cherilyn  so we did in the quarter reduce our total locomotive fleet by about 300  We sold a couple of hundred  We did find a buyer and we scrapped another 100 or so  So  we are continuing to evaluate those things at all points and looking at what s the best financial decision for us to make as a company  But we look forward to bringing those locomotives that are in storage and putting them back in the service  because we do think that s the most cost efficient way to handle future volume growth as to leverage that existing fleet Cherilyn Radbourne    TD Securities    AnalystOkay  And then on the improvement in train size that you referenced  should we assume that most of that still resides along the Sunset Corridor and that the siding extensions that are penciled into the capex budget are directed to that region Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think we re going to see the extension of the Sunset with the capex that we re putting in on the sidings that will help  but we also see    to be able to deliver bigger trains with the volume decrease  the team did a great job  So  if we see a volume will help us  if we have a slight uptick in volume  but on top of that I see benefit across the whole network  we re just starting down on the train length in every one of the quarter  So there is a little bit in all of them  A major piece will be the through the capital investment  Cherilyn Cherilyn Radbourne    TD Securities    AnalystGreat  That s all from me Lance M  Fritz    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with

product and probably a dozen of your answers to the Q A today  That seems to be resonating with your message  and it certainly is showing up in the Trip Plan Compliance going from  call it  low 60 s to mid 70 s  in the span of a couple of quarters here  Are your customers starting to feel that and when does the network get to sort of a stable  steady fluid state or you really unleash the sales

happen  By mid third quarter    call it the second half of the year    our service product that s the operating team gave us  I mean  it really picked up and customers really got confidence there  We have a number of internal measurements and surveys that we do  that we look at really every day  and we are seeing that our customers are communicating through that and then talking with them what they see it  Our sales team  they re sitting down with them  laying out the benefit  selling the service  quantifying the value proposition that s there  So it s really setting up a good 2024 Bascome

154398,375914,UNP,Union Pacific eyes 3 000 fewer workers in 2020,news,"Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  plans to run its railroad with nearly 3K fewer  workers this year  CEO Lance Fritz tells WSJ  as it pushes ahead with a new operating plan  that runs fewer  longer trains 
The company plans to reduce its average number of workers by  8  in 2020 after reducing its staffing by 11  in 2019  it averaged nearly 42K workers during 2018  37 5K during 2019 and only 34 5K in Q4 
 The service design is reducing work that doesn t need to occur and  that s eliminating jobs   Fritz says  but  as volume comes back  we ll be able to grow our workforce  
Rival CSX ended 2019 with 20 9K workers  nearly 1 600 fewer jobs than the previous year  after paring down from 27K employees in December 2016 before the late Hunter Harrison was named CEO  and revamped the company 
UNP shares gained 3 4  in today s trade despite missing Q4 earnings estimates  as its operating ratio continues to improve even with fewer carloads  the company also said it expects an increase in shipping volume for FY 2020 after a slump in 2019 ",2020-01-23,Seeking Alpha,https://invst.ly/pm49u,2066664
154399,375915,UNP,Is Union Pacific Stock a Buy ,news,"Union Pacific s  NYSE UNP  fourth quarter earnings report was eagerly anticipated for a few reasons  First  railroads are a key bellwether of the economy  and second  investors were keen to see whether the company would be able to keep increasing its profitability even in an economic slowdown  On both fronts the message was positive  and the conclusions drawn from the earnings are good ones for investors in railroad stocks  Let s take a closer look at why 
Second half recovery 
The investment thesis  that there s going to be a recovery in the industrial economy in the second half of 2020 received further support from Union Pacific  Management of East Coast railroad CSX  NASDAQ CSX  had already expressed confidence on the matter  claiming that its first quarter would be the low point from a growth perspective 

The implication from Union Pacific is similar  Quoting from CFO Jennifer Hamann on the earnings call   we expect to see volumes inflect to the positive side of the ledger on a full year basis  growing 1  or so overall   As you can see below  this implies a significant recovery from the declines going through 2019  Moreover  Hamann said    the company  will continue to pursue a pricing strategy where the dollars gained exceed our 2020 rail inflation cost  
Combined  these two points paint a picture of a positive contribution from volume and pricing on a full year 2020 basis  Indeed  analyst consensus forecasts have Union Pacific improving revenue by 2 1  in 2020 

What about Union Pacific s profitability 
The biggest thing happening in the railroad industry right now is something called precision scheduled railroading  PSR   Simply put  it s a set of management principles intended to run the same amount of volume but using fewer assets  For example  under PSR  trains are run between two points on a network at fixed times  This is distinct from the hub and spoke model where cars enter hubs and then are attached to other trains 
Progress on PSR is usually measured in terms of increasing average train speed  reducing freight car terminal dwell  the time a car spends at a scheduled stop without moving   and improving workforce productivity  daily car miles per full time employee   The ultimate result is expected to be a reduction in the operating ratio  OR   which is simply operating expenses divided by revenue    a lower number is better 
The big question is whether the railroads  and all the listed Class 1 railroads are now implementing PSR  will be able to lower their OR in an environment where the economy is slowing  The answer to this question appears to be  yes   Union Pacific managed to improve its operational metrics in Q4 and the OR fell again  despite operating revenue declining 9  in the quarter  

Data source  Union Pacific presentations 
Moreover  management s OR outlook for 2020 implies continued improvement  Management plans to reduce the workforce by 8  and make  500 million of productivity improvements in 2020  resulting in an OR of around 59    Considering the weakness in the industrial economy in the last year or so  that would be a very good result  Note that analyst estimates for 2020 revenue imply a figure nearly 3  below that in 2018  but an earnings per share  EPS  figure 19  above

Time to buy Union Pacific 
For dividend seeking investors looking for a pretty reliable source of income  Union Pacific is a pretty good option  The company typically pays out 40  to 45  of its earnings in dividends and  based on the earnings estimates above  that s likely to mean a 2 1  dividend yield for 2020 with potential for growth    management believes it can get to an OR of 55  over time  Throw in some upside from a potential recovery in the industrial economy in 2020 and an improvement in trade conditions due to an easing of trade tensions  and the outlook is positive for Union Pacific ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnxzr,2069480

The implication is that volumes in coal and intermodal transportation will once again decline and operational efficiency is unlikely to make up the difference At last November s RailTrends conference  CSX executive vice president of marketing and sales  Mark Wallace  outlined the company s strategy  highlighting the rail industry s rather paltry 8  share of the  980 billion spent annually on transportation   Truckers have been eating our lunch for decades    The uncomfortable truth is that many former and potential rail customers have  however reluctantly  demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for the superior reliability offered by the truck  Increasing railroads  reliability with a process called precision scheduled railroading  or PSR  as it is often called   a system that focuses on running trains between two points on a network at a specified time  This is different from the traditional hub and spoke model  where railcars tend to enter a hub and are then attached to a train en route to its final destination This is an improvement  as CSX s record low operating ratio demonstrates  Yet  as every other railroad adopts the system  railroading becomes a zero sum game Railroads are not going to steal customers from trucking companies that operate over the so called last mile to the customer s door  The object should be figuring out a way to increase railroads  share of that  980 billion to 10  or more  That is apparently not on the table yet

Southwest deals with more MAX concerns
Shares of Southwest Airlines were up between 1  and 2  in the wake of the airline s fourth quarter financial report  That came despite a drop in Southwest s bottom line  and even with the rise in share price  investors still aren t entirely sure how to get past concerns about the future of the 737 MAX aircraft 

Southwest s net income for the fourth quarter fell 21  from year ago levels  although much of the drop came from higher profit sharing contributions to employee compensation  Revenue inched higher by 0 4   although both passenger and freight related sales posted modest declines  Despite cheaper fuel costs  total operating expenses rose significantly 
CEO Gary Kelly was quick to note that Southwest s performance throughout 2019 was  truly remarkable   given the impact of the grounding of the 737 MAX for much of the year  Yet the airline wasn t able to reassure investors about any firm timeline for a return to service for the aircraft  saying only that it s already adjusted schedules through early June  Other airlines are looking at even longer delays for the 737 MAX 
Southwest gets big benefits from operating only 737 aircraft models  but it s proven to be a big problem for the airline in light of the MAX s issues  For now  shareholders are optimistic that things will turn out well  but only time will truly tell whether 2020 will be a bounce back year for Southwest

154438,375954,UNP,Earnings Preview  Union Pacific  UNP  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Union Pacific  UNP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 21 billion  down 9 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 33  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific 
For Union Pacific  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of  2 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 22  delivering a surprise of  3 06  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Union Pacific doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-union-pacific-unp-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200499350,200499350
154463,375979,UNP,Hyundai  Kia sue four big U S  railroads over fuel surcharges,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
 Reuters     Hyundai Motor  Co  KS 005380  and its Kia affiliate have sued the four largest U S  railroads  accusing them of violating U S  antitrust law by conspiring to drive up shipping costs though coordinated fuel surcharges 
The South Korean automakers filed three lawsuits on Monday accusing BNSF  CSX Corp  O CSX    Norfolk Southern  Corp  N NSC  and  Union Pacific  Corp  N UNP  of imposing the surcharges between July 2003 and December 2008 
BNSF is a unit of billionaire Warren Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa   but was a standalone company at the time of the alleged conspiracy 
The lawsuits seek triple damages and were filed in the federal court in Santa Ana  California  near the automakers  respective U S  headquarters 
Lawyers for BNSF referred a request for comment to that company  which did not immediately respond  The other railroads  lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Citing meetings  phone calls and emails  Hyundai and Kia accused the railroads of conspiring to impose fuel surcharges  under the guise of a fuel cost recovery program  that ultimately generated billions of dollars in profit at customers  expense 
Their lawsuits cited a 2007 independent study that said the railroads  fuel surcharge revenue exceeded their fuel costs by more than  6 billion from 2003 to March 2007 
Hyundai and Kia sued 6 1 2 weeks after a federal appeals court in Washington  D C  said nationwide litigation over the surcharges could not proceed as a class action because more than 2 000 members of the proposed class were not harmed  The automakers  law firm also worked on that case

154465,375981,UNP,American Railroads Are Already in Recession With No End in Sight,news," Bloomberg     This year s railroad slump is getting worse as a slowdown in manufacturing threatens broader weakness in the U S  economy 
There s no bottom in sight as the decline in carloads for large U S  railroads widened to 5 5  in the third quarter  the biggest drop in three years  according to weekly reports from the Association of American Railroads  Shipments are down for autos  coal  grain  chemicals and consumer goods  with crude oil the only bright spot 
The rail downturn underscores the damage from the U S  China trade war  which is making shippers more cautious and crimping freight    validating earlier warnings from railroad executives  Companies that stocked up on inventory last year amid President Donald Trump s tariff threats are now working it off  Adding to the cargo drop  a brief rise in coal exports has fizzled and bad weather has delayed crop harvests and dragged down grain carloads 
 What s quite clear is that we re not yet at a trough  Trains have not yet bottomed   said Ben Hartford  an analyst with Robert W  Baird   Co   We need to have some clarity in trade policy  
While a railroad recession doesn t necessarily presage a broader slump  it s a dramatic turn from a year ago when rising shipments of autos  coal  lumber  chemicals and other commodities spurred U S  rail carloads to rise 3 6  in 2018  Last year s hot freight market jacked up trucking prices  and transportation costs spiked for companies including  General Mills  Inc  NYSE GIS   and Procter   Gamble Co 
 No Pockets 
Now   there are no pockets of growth   said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Lee Klaskow  who sounded the alarm about a  railroad recession  in a recent report   There s really nothing that s tapping me on the shoulder saying   Hey look at me  I m going to be your next growth engine   
A rail recession isn t necessarily a harbinger of a general economic downturn  Klaskow said  The U S  economy continued to expand when carloads fell 2 1  in 2015 and 4 5  in 2016  after a crude by rail boom went bust 
Investors are partially insulated from the recent drop because earnings are holding up at the four large publicly traded railroads in the U S   which have adopted an efficiency strategy developed by Hunter Harrison  The industry guru died in 2017 after overhauling CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX  with his  precision scheduled railroading  approach 
CSX  NASDAQ CSX  is the only major U S  railroad that is poised to see earnings drop in the third quarter from a year earlier  Increases are expected at   Union Pacific   Corporation  NYSE UNP     Norfolk Southern    NYSE NSC  and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   which adopted the efficiency techniques after CSX and are still reaping the rewards  That s shoring up the railroads  shares  although only Kansas City Southern is outperforming a Standard   Poor s index of U S  industrial companies 
Factory Slump
Cargo volumes have held up better at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd  and Canadian National Railway Co   as more maritime cargo from Asia shifts to Canadian ports  But in the U S   sagging freight shipments are taking a toll 
The Institute for Supply Management s factory index slipped to 47 8 in September  the lowest since June 2009  It was also the second straight month the index was below 50  which signals contraction 
Truckers are also feeling the pain  Less than truckload cargo  which tends to be tied to industrial production  plummeted 12  in August from a year earlier  Freight carried by long haul trucking is still growing as consumer spending holds up  Truck cargo prices  though  have dropped 
Cheaper trucking rates are pulling some freight from rails  But even if that trend moderates next year and the decline in rail carloads slows  there s no guarantee of growth    especially if the factory weakness drags down consumer spending 
 That s the risk at this point in time  that the consumer does begin to show impacts from the pain that we see on the manufacturing side   Hartford said  As for rail freight   when is it going to turn  I honestly have no idea  ",2019-10-07,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/american-railroads-are-already-in-recession-with-no-end-in-sight-1992728,1992728

Shares in the Omaha  Nebraska based company rose 4 6  to  172 14 in early trading 
Union Pacific s better than expected results arrived amid worries that cooling global economic growth and President Donald Trump s trade war have spurred a  freight recession  in the U S  transportation industry 
East Coast railroad operator CSX Corp  O CSX  rattled the sector on Tuesday when it revised its 2019 revenue forecast to call for a slight drop   rather than a slight gain   following trade related weakness in its intermodal and metals units 
Severe weather again tested Union Pacific s sweeping business overhaul  During the second quarter  the railroad s operating ratio declined 3 4 points to a company best of 59 6   A lower ratio translates into higher profitability 
Operating ratio is expected to be lower in the second half than in the first half of 2019  when record flooding forced it to reroute trains  executives said on a conference call with analysts 
Net income at Union Pacific  which serves the Western two thirds of the country  rose 4  to  1 57 billion  or  2 22 per share  in the second quarter  Analysts had expected a profit of  2 14 per share in the quarter  according to IBES data from Refinitiv

154526,376042,UNP,New Mexico armed border group barred from Facebook fund raising,news,"By Andrew Hay
TAOS  N M   Reuters     Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB  on Thursday barred a New Mexico based paramilitary group that has stopped undocumented migrants near the U S  Mexico border from using its fundraising tools and said it would remove any of its posts that violated company policies 
Facebook made the statement after a civil rights organization asked it to block videos posted by the United Constitutional Patriots  UCP   saying the clips violated its standards  which prohibit images showing criminal acts 
 People cannot use our fundraising tools for activities involving weapons   said a Facebook spokesperson in a statement   We will remove fundraisers this group may try to start on our service and any content that violates our Community Standards  
Since February  the UCP have posted a string of videos showing members armed with semi automatic rifles halting migrants in New Mexico and telling them to sit and wait for U S  Border Patrol to arrest them 
The UCP says the videos demonstrate its work helping Border Patrol detain some 5 600 migrants in just 60 days during a surge in illegal crossings  Civil rights groups accuse the group of illegally detaining asylum seekers 
 These videos include content showing possible assault  kidnapping and false imprisonment   the Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said in a statement on Thursday asking Facebook to remove them 
UCP spokesman Jim Benvie did not immediately respond to a request for comment  In a Facebook Live post on Tuesday he described the group s videos as  citizen journalism  showing reality on the border 
 There is a crisis at the border  we are being invaded   Benvie said  Facebook s Community Standards bar users from publicizing crime  using hate speech or presenting arguments for restricting immigration policy  among other things  the spokesperson said 
PayPal and GoFundMe on Friday barred the UCP  citing policies that prohibit the promotion of hate or violence 
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham last week called for an investigation of the group 
The FBI arrested the UCP s commander  Larry Hopkins  on Saturday on federal weapons charges dating back to 2017 
Hopkins was assaulted in a New Mexico jail on Monday and hospitalized with broken ribs

What s Next for Union Pacific 
While Union Pacific has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Union Pacific was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

JetBlue Airways  NASDAQ JBLU  will also report earnings tomorrow morning  and there will be numbers from discount rival Southwest  NYSE LUV  
Railroad giant  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP  will report  which should give investors some idea of the impact the U S  trade battles are having 
The stock hit a six month nadir in late December  when pessimism about trade deals was highest  but has since recovered nicely and is up for the last three months 
On average  analysts predict UP earned  2 06 per share in the latest quarter and had revenue of more than  5 7 billion

3  Products Numbers in Focus as Well for Oil
Oil traders had to wait an extra day to get the latest weekly crude inventory numbers due to Monday s holiday  and there s lot of attention on tomorrow s figures 
 The market continues to be caught between what appears to be a product glut with emphasis on gasoline and too much crude production   said Scott Shelton  energy futures broker and commentator with ICAP  LON NXGN  in Durham  N C

As of this afternoon  traders predicted U S  stockpiles would fall by just 42 000 barrels in the latest week 
The EIA said last week that gasoline inventories rose by 7 5 million barrels  compared to expectations for a build of 2 77 million barrels  while distillate stockpiles increased by 2 97 million barrels  compared to forecasts for a gain of 1 57 million ",2019-01-23,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1755626,1755626

154608,376124,UNP,Freight Slowdown  A Terrible Sign For The Economy,opinion,"Just as an army moves on its stomach  an economy moves on ships  trucks  and planes  They carry the goods whose purchase adds up to growth 
Nowadays many goods are digital  delivered electronically  But we still need lots of physical stuff which must travel to the customer 
Fewer goods in motion mean lower growth  and that s exactly what is happening 
With technology  businesses have grown adept at managing inventory  Goods don t typically sit on store shelves very long  Retailers stop ordering quickly when demand falls 
Falling Freight Rates
Last summer  the nation s overheated highways were crammed  Truckers had all the business they could handle as companies rushed to import Chinese goods ahead of expected tariffs 
I said at the time it would end badly  Sure enough  now truckers are struggling with excess capacity and lower volume  Freight rates have dropped hard this year 
Some smaller trucking companies have declared bankruptcy while bigger ones like Knight Swift and Schneider have cut their annual forecasts  Several Wall Street analysts have downgraded J B  Hunt  one of the biggest players 
It s not just trucks  either  Container ship lines  railroads  warehouse operators the entire logistics industry is starting to contract  You can see it in these recent Wall Street Journal headlines 

Freight Operators Slowed Hiring in May on Weaker Shipping Demand
Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  Says Uncertainty  Harsh Weather Driving Down Rail Shipments
Trade Tensions Worry Ship Operators
Imports at Southern  NYSE SO  California Ports Fell Sharply Last Month

This was perfectly predictable  The 2018 transport boom didn t represent a higher demand for imported goods  It was future demand  pulled forward in time  President Trump s tariff threats gave importers incentive to rush  and they did 
Now the future is here  Shelves are full  so traffic is no longer growing as much  and in some segments  it s falling  The widely regarded Cass Freight Index shows declining year over year volume for the last six consecutive months 
Chart  Cass Information Systems
Spilling Over
Excess stockpiles of imported goods aren t the only sign of slowdown  Manufacturing activity is also slowing  both in the US and elsewhere 
This month the IHS Markit Purchasing Managers Index for US manufacturing activity dropped to its lowest level since September 2009  when the economy was in recession  Now it is only a fraction away from signalling an outright contraction 
This might explain an otherwise odd headline I noticed recently   North American robot orders down in Q1   The title refers to industrial robots  the kind that have been taking human jobs 
That trend seems to be slowing  which is what you would expect if factories have plenty of capacity to meet current demand 
Worse  the manufacturing weakness is spilling over into the rest of the economy  Here s IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson 
Recent months have seen a manufacturing led downturn increasingly infect the service sector  The strong services economy seen earlier in the year has buckled to show barely any expansion in June  recording the second weakest monthly growth since the global financial crisis 
All these comparisons to 2008 and 2009 are more than a little chilling  I remember those years pretty well  and they weren t fun  To now see similar conditions is  at the very least  not good and possibly very bad 
Meanwhile  Wall Street thinks a magical solution will appear 
Delayed Recession A lot of this is connected to the ongoing trade war  but not all  The economic expansion would probably be nearing its end anyway  Growth cycles rarely last as long as this one has 
Here s my theory  The economy should have entered recession a year ago  The late 2017 tax cuts bought a little time by encouraging business investment  while the Fed s rate hikes made homebuyers rush to beat rising mortgage rates 
Then  the Trump trade fight sparked an import boom that created more activity and jobs  That extended the growth a little more  But those effects were temporary  and now they re running out 
Some investors think the Fed will pull a rabbit out of the hat by cutting rates again  But access to credit isn t the problem 
Businesses that want to borrow can do so on good terms  The problem is they don t need to borrow unless they are growing  and they re not  The Fed can t fix that 
Shipping weakness is an early warning sign  It doesn t mean a recession is imminent  but the longer it lasts  the more certain we can be that the weakness will spread 
Here s how Cass says it in its latest report 

 The freight markets  or more accurately goods flow  has a well earned reputation for predictive value without the anchoring biases that are found in many models which attempt to predict the broader economy  
 The volume of freight in multiple modes is materially slowing and suggests an increasingly bearish economic outlook for the U S  domestic economy  
 With the  6 0  drop in May  we see the shipments index as going from  warning of a potential slowdown  to  signaling an economic contraction   

Again  the timing is hard  but it can happen fast  Well into 2008  the economy was already in recession  but we realized it only later  By October  there was no doubt 
Let s hope that 2019 is different ",2019-07-02,Patrick Watson,https://www.investing.com/analysis/freight-slowdown-is-a-terrible-sign-for-the-economy-200436334,200436334

154642,376158,UNP,In Mississippi Senate race  a  hanging  remark spurs Democrats,news,"By John Whitesides JACKSON  Miss   Reuters    A white Republican senator s casual reference to a  public hanging  has invigorated a special election runoff in Mississippi  fueling Democratic hopes of an upset in a conservative state with an ugly history of racist violence  The U S  Senate race between appointed Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde Smith and Democrat Mike Espy  a black former congressman and U S  agriculture secretary  will test the power of the black vote and the viability of Democrats in a region where Republicans have dominated for decades  The Nov  27 runoff  which caps a congressional election cycle drawn out by recounts and too close to call races  will not affect the balance of power in Congress  Republicans will hold a Senate majority even if Hyde Smith loses and Democrats will control the House of Representatives  Espy  64  is a heavy underdog in the Deep South state  which has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1982  But his campaign got a jolt of adrenaline when a video surfaced a week ago showing Hyde Smith  59  praising a supporter by saying   If he invited me to a public hanging  I d be on the front row   The comment set off a furor in Mississippi  a state scarred by a history of racism and violence against blacks  including lynching  According to the NAACP civil rights group  Mississippi had 581 lynchings between 1882 and 1968  more than any other state  Advocacy groups conducting a voter turnout drive aimed primarily at African Americans  who make up 38 percent of the state s residents  said their efforts had gained new urgency   If people recognize the importance of this moment  there is an opportunity for Secretary Espy to win this race   said Chokwe Antar Lumumba  the black Democratic mayor of Jackson  the state s largest city   If we can show progress in a state with such historic suffering  then what does it say about the future   Hyde Smith  a former state legislator appointed in April to replace retiring Senator Thad Cochran  released a statement calling the Nov  2 comment  an exaggerated expression of regard  for a friend  She refused to apologize and has not addressed the remarks further  Retail giant Walmart  NYSE WMT   medical device maker Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX  and railroad  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP  made public requests this week for Hyde Smith to return their donations because of the remarks  Her campaign declined to comment  Walmart said on Twitter on Tuesday that Hyde Smith s comments  clearly do not reflect the values of our company and associates   Espy would be the first black senator from Mississippi since shortly after the Civil War  He told reporters Hyde Smith s  disappointing  hurtful  remarks perpetuated stereotypes Mississippi was striving to overcome   There was already a high level of engagement but her comments took everything up to a whole new level   said Cassandra Welchlin  co director of the Mississippi Black Women s Roundtable  one of at least two dozen advocacy groups involved in turnout efforts  Welchlin s group is partnering with childcare centers  churches and sororities to target infrequent black women voters  Other groups are focusing on registered black voters who did not participate in the Nov  6 election  using phone banks  texting parties and ride shares to get them out  THE ALABAMA MODEL  Mississippi Democrats hope to recreate the coalition that propelled Democrat Doug Jones to a Senate victory in neighboring Alabama last year by energizing black voters  particularly women  and appealing to white swing voters  Espy has used the Jones race as a template  focusing on issues like rural healthcare  equal pay and education  A political moderate  he portrays himself as a bridge builder in a state where Republican President Donald Trump is popular  At a weekend breakfast in Jackson  Espy told black women leaders that Jones was elected because women turned out to support him   What that did for Doug Jones in Alabama  you have to do for me in Mississippi   he said  The runoff to serve the last two years of Cochran s term was needed because no candidate gained more than 50 percent of the vote in a Nov  6 special election  Hyde Smith and Espy  who nearly deadlocked at about 41 percent  will meet in a debate on Tuesday night  Both the Republican and Democratic national parties have sent help to Mississippi for the runoff  Trump will hold two get out the vote rallies in the state next week  and the National Republican Senatorial Committee said it was spending at least  800 000 on ads  That will be augmented by  1 million from the Senate Leadership Fund  an outside group aligned with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell  National Democratic committees are sending staff to help get out the vote  and the Democratic aligned Senate Majority PAC has started a  500 000 ad buy  Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey  who are both African American and potential 2020 presidential contenders  campaigned with Espy   This is a race that has national importance   Harris said at the Jackson breakfast  saying the outcome would  make a point about who we are as a country  symbolized by the state of Mississippi    CONSERVATIVE STATE  Hyde Smith has hammered Espy as too liberal for Mississippi  She touts her endorsement from Trump  who won Mississippi by 18 percentage points in 2016  and campaigns in a bus with a blown up photo of her and Trump stretched across the side   This race is a conservative versus a liberal and Mississippi is a conservative state   said Melissa Scallan  a spokeswoman for Hyde Smith  She declined to comment on the hanging remarks  Hyde Smith became embroiled in another controversy last week when a video surfaced in which she seemed to endorse the voter suppression of liberal students as  a great idea   In a statement  Hyde Smith s campaign said she was joking  The wild card in the runoff will be how many supporters of Republican Chris McDaniel  a hard line conservative who captured 16 5 percent of the vote on Nov  6  stay home or back Espy instead of Hyde Smith  McDaniel had criticized Hyde Smith  a former Democrat who switched parties in 2010  as insufficiently conservative but endorsed her   Hal Marx  a McDaniel supporter and mayor of the small town of Petal  said he was not enthusiastic about Hyde Smith but would vote for her  
 She isn t the best choice possible but of the two that are left we need a Republican in the seat   Marx said ",2018-11-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/in-mississippi-senate-race-a-hanging-remark-spurs-democrats-1694678,1694678

Chicago  IL   April 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP    CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX    Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU    Norfolk Southern   NYSE NSC   and Canadian Pacific Railway   NYSE CP   
Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  
Rails Making a Comeback 
America s largest railroad company  Union Pacific  beat earnings this morning sending the stock surging over 4   UNP announced Q1 EPS at  1 93 per share beating the  1 89 estimates and was up 15  from EPS reported for the same quarter in 2018  UNP followed suit of railroad earnings with both CSX Corp  and Kansas City Southern reporting a strong positive earnings surprise earlier this week 
Union Pacific announced it would temporarily halt its  550 million project in Brazos  Texas as well as close down two  hump yards  in order to focus on operational efficiencies  The Brazos project is the largest undertaking in the history of Union Pacific  which dates back to 1862 
The entire railroad industry is hitting all time highs this week following strong earnings support  The question that we pose to ourselves as investors is  what is driving this and what implications does this have on the broader markets  
Railroads have been the backbone of the US economy since the industrial revolution in the 1800s  We rely on railways to get our bulk cargo from one side of the US to the other with ease  When the economy is doing well so are railroad companies  Strong economic performance means businesses require more goods to be transported  causing railroad earnings to have a direct positive correlation with the markets 
The main driver of this seems to be the growing margins that each one of these companies is achieving  The railways are becoming more efficient  having more cars per load and fewer delays  Also  fuel costs have fallen since their high in September  allowing these railroads to operate each trip at a lower cost 
Upcoming Railroad Earnings
Norfolk Southern  4 24
Norfolk Southern connects 22 states in Eastern US  operating 19 420 miles of rails  NSC is expected to have earnings of  2 17 per share  which would represent over 12  growth from the same quarter last year  Norfolk has an estimated to have Q1 revenue of  2 8 billion  over 3  growth from 2018  
NSC has beat estimates for 6 consecutive earnings reports prior to this one  NSC has delivered returns exceeding 33  to investors so far this year so a beat may already have been priced in with the railway earnings being so strong already this week  NSC   Zacks Rank  3  Hold    
Canadian Pacific Railway  4 23
Canadian Pacific Railways was created in the late 1800s and connects the northern US with southern Canada  CP is estimated to have earnings of  2 29 per share  which would be a 7 5  increase from the same quarter last year but a decline of over 33  from the previous quarter  They are expected to report  1 3 billion in quarterly revenue  CP has had mixed EPS surprises but has beat 5 out of the last 6 revenue estimates  CP   Zacks Rank  3  Hold

154645,376161,UNP,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Union Pacific  UNP  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Union Pacific in Focus
Headquartered in Omaha  Union Pacific  UNP  is a Transportation stock that has seen a price change of 27 24  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 88 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2   In comparison  the Transportation   Rail industry s yield is 1 16   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 87  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 52 is up 15  from last year  Union Pacific has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11 97   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Union Pacific s current payout ratio is 43   meaning it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for UNP for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 06 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 14 54  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  UNP is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-union-pacific-unp-could-be-a-great-choice-200416609,200416609

154681,376197,UNP,Union Pacific  UNP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Union Pacific  UNP  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 7  
Revenues are expected to be  5 62 billion  up 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific 
For Union Pacific  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of  2 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 12  delivering a surprise of  2 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

154683,376199,UNP,Rails Making A Comeback ,opinion,"America s largest railroad company  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP    beat earnings this morning sending the stock surging over 4   UNP announced Q1 EPS at  1 93 per share beating the  1 89 estimates and was up 15  from EPS reported for the same quarter in 2018  UNP followed suit of railroad earnings with both CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   and Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   reporting a strong positive earnings surprise earlier this week 
Union Pacific announced it would temporarily halt its  550 million project in Brazos  Texas as well as close down two  hump yards  in order to focus on operational efficiencies  The Brazos project is the largest undertaking in the history of Union Pacific  which dates back to 1862 
The entire railroad industry is hitting all time highs this week following strong earnings support  The question that we pose to ourselves as investors is  what is driving this and what implications does this have on the broader markets  Below is the 10 year performance chart of UNP  CSX  KSU

 
Railroads have been the backbone of the US economy since the industrial revolution in the 1800s  We rely on railways to get our bulk cargo from one side of the US to the other with ease  When the economy is doing well so are railroad companies  Strong economic performance means businesses require more goods to be transported  causing railroad earnings to have a direct positive correlation with the markets 
The main driver of this seems to be the growing margins that each one of these companies is achieving  The railways are becoming more efficient  having more cars per load and fewer delays  Also  fuel costs have fallen since their high in September  allowing these railroads to operate each trip at a lower cost

announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX    Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CP    Canadian National Railway Co    NYSE CNI   and Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Railroads Hopeful on 2019  Should You Buy On Mar 6  CEOs of two major freight railroads   Lance Fritz of Union Pacific Corp  and Jim Foote of CSX Corp  told CNBC that the U S  economy still holds lot of potential for freight railroads  Both the CEOs unanimously agreed that  the U S  industrial still looks pretty healthy  buoyed by a robust labor market  record low unemployment level and solid wage growth  They further added  overall wealth for consumers looks pretty good  The railroad industry seems to be poised well not only in the near term but also in the long haul on the back of robust freight demand fueled by a buoyant U S  economy  A strong U S  economy supports the bullishness of freight railroad operators  as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country  Currently  nearly 35  of the U S  exports are shifted to the ports by freight railways Strong Intermodal BusinessGrowth of intermodal volumes in recent years is anticipated to drive railroads  top line  Volumes at this key revenue generating unit rose 5 6  in 2018  thanks to an increasing number of freight conversions from highway to rail due to limited truck supply Intermodal segment has improved significantly in 2019  In the last two weeks of February  intermodal volumes grew a significant 816 986 units  Strong intermodal volumes have been bolstering railroads  top line and the uptrend is likely to continue going forward  Improving prospects of intermodal segment has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of the year  Further  the railroad operators  sustained cost reduction efforts are anticipated to drive the bottom line going forward Although coal volumes have historically contributed the maximum to rail carloads  the companies have shifted their dependence to intermodal on account of dwindling coal volumes   Notably  intermodal now reportedly dominates overall carloads  Apart from a low truck count  growing e commerce demand is another catalyst behind growth of intermodal  Consequently  the sluggish coal scenario is likely to be less of a hindrance for railroads Robust AAR DataThe Association of American Railroads   AAR    the industry body of the class 1 freight railroad operators  reported that U S  rail traffic  including carloads and intermodal units  was pegged at 528 153 for the week ended Mar 2  2019  This reflects an increase of 1 1  from the previous week  Two of the 10 carload commodity groups reported an increase compared with the same week in 2018  Total U S  rail traffic for the first eight weeks of 2019 was 4 120 979 carloads  up 0 1  year over year Additionally  railroads have been witnessing an improvement pertaining to another key metric    operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  in 2019  The lesser the value of operating ratio  the better  as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks Performance of Major RailroadsYear to date  stock price of major railroad operators  such as Union Pacific  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CSX Corp   Canadian

154723,376239,UNP,Union Pacific  UNP  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Union Pacific in Focus
Based in Omaha  Union Pacific  UNP  is in the Transportation sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 20 69   Currently paying a dividend of  0 88 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 11   In comparison  the Transportation   Rail industry s yield is 1 34   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 52 is up 15  from last year  Union Pacific has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11 20   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Union Pacific s payout ratio is 40   which means it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  UNP expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 05 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 14 41  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that UNP is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-03-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/union-pacific-unp-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200397709,200397709

154770,376286,UNP,3 Reasons Why Union Pacific  UNP  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Union Pacific  UNP  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this railroad is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Union Pacific is 5 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 14 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 7  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Union Pacific has an S TA ratio of 0 39  which means that the company gets  0 39 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 35  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Union Pacific looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 4 2  this year versus the industry average of 3 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Union Pacific  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Union Pacific a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 24  2019  Union Pacific reported EPS of  2 12 versus consensus estimate of  2 06 
For the current fiscal year  Union Pacific is expected to post earnings of  9 07 per share on  23 8 billion in revenues  This represents a 14 66  change in EPS on a 4 23  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  10 2 per share on  24 84 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 12 44  and 4 37   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Union Pacific may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Union Pacific has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 18 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 15 3X versus its peer group s average of 11 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 75  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Union Pacific currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Union Pacific meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Union Pacific shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Union Pacific Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Union Pacific have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Air Lease  AL   Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte S A B  de C V   OMAB   and Herc Holdings  HRI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 35  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Union Pacific  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/union-pacific-unp-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200388825,200388825

154802,376318,UNP,Buffett s BNSF cuts ethanol shipper costs amid push for safer train cars,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK  Reuters    BNSF Railway Co will start offering discounts to ethanol shippers this April if they agree to use new  safer train cars  as it pushes to scrub puncture prone ones from its rail lines at a faster pace than required by U S  regulations   The move by Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  N BRKa  rail company comes even as ethanol shippers have been slow to embrace the new train cars mandated by sweeping new regulations enacted in 2015 after a series of fiery crude oil derailments   BNSF is offering shippers discounts of  300 per carload if they use newer model tank cars  called DOT 117s  according to a shipping notice seen by Reuters  Ethanol shippers are not required to use those newer cars until 2025  a longer timeline than given to crude oil shippers  Ethanol shippers were given more time than crude shippers because a typical shipment of the biofuel  which is blended into gasoline  was seen as less dangerous and companies said they needed more time to overhaul the cars   A recent decline in rail volumes has given the industry more flexibility to overhaul its cars  There were 35 252 tank cars hauling ethanol in September  and 84 percent  or 29 597  were DOT 111s  according to the Association of American Railroads  The newer model DOT 117s accounted for just 6 percent of the ethanol fleet  AAR data shows   BN  BNSF  is trying to expedite the process of switching over   but  it s unclear if it will really work   said Neil Shah  a trader with Biourja Trading LLC in Houston  Fuel train derailments pose significant risk to BNSF  which has a high deductible insurance policy designed to protect against catastrophic incidents  Also  derailments leave lines shut and deliveries delayed  costing money  There have been at least 16 significant ethanol or crude oil derailments since 2006  and nearly all involved DOT 111s  according to the National Transportation Safety Board   Accident investigators have said DOT 111s cars tend to puncture during derailments  sometimes causing fires  The oil train that derailed and exploded  leveling part of the Quebec town of Lac Megantic and killing 47 people in 2013  was made up of DOT 111 tank cars   BIGGER DISCOUNTS  Tom Williamson  a railcar broker and owner of Transportation Consultants  said BNSF s actions have boosted interest from shippers  who could save  60 000 a month if they make two trips with 100 cars per train   Obviously  clients would like to take advantage of the discount  said Williamson  adding that some clients have decided to trade in their DOT 111s early for newer models in exchange for extending their leases   He said monthly lease rates for the new rail cars have increased by  200  to roughly  650 a month  the biggest jump in some time  DOT 111s are currently leasing at roughly  250 a month  he said   BNSF is telling the market that they are willing to consider bigger discounts if this doesn t work   Williamson said  BNSF declined to comment on the reasons for the move  saying the shipping notice speaks for itself  No other major U S  railroads CSX  O CSX    Norfolk Southern   N NSC  and  Union Pacific  Corp   N UNP  said they were offering similar discounts  A spokeswoman for Union Pacific  the largest U S  railroad  said the company is currently not offering a broad incentive program because it recognizes the DOT 117s may not be practical for all customers  Scrutiny of DOT 111s grew alongside the growth of crude rail shipments  which surged due to the lack of pipeline infrastructure in the Bakken fields of North Dakota before declining in recent months   The latest federal figures show crude rail volumes have dropped to roughly 400 000 barrels per day  while roughly 580 000 bpd of ethanol moves on U S  rails  EIA data shows

154847,376363,UNP,North Dakota pipeline fight gives spark to Native American activism,news,"By Andrew Cullen and Ruthy Munoz CANNON BALL  N D  WASHINGTON  Reuters    A Native American tribe s efforts to halt construction of a crude oil pipeline in North Dakota have swelled into a movement  drawing international attention and the support of movie stars and social media  and making a major oil company blink  While the tribe s lawyers work to persuade a federal judge to withdraw permits for the pipeline in a ruling expected on Friday  thousands of protesters gathered at campgrounds near Standing Rock Sioux Tribe lands   This is a new beginning  not just for our tribe  but for all tribes in this country   said Standing Rock Sioux spokesman Ron His Horse is Thunder  one of the leaders hoping for a rebirth of Native American activism beyond the pipeline battle  Representatives of 200 tribes and environmentalists have set up camp in the rolling hills near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannon Ball rivers in sight of the proposed pipeline route  They say the planned pipeline  near but not on tribal land  runs through a sacred burial ground and could leak  polluting nearby rivers and poisoning the tribe s water source  The 1 100 mile  1 770 km    3 7 billion Dakota Access pipeline would carry oil from just north of the tribe s land in North Dakota to Illinois  where it would hook up to an existing pipeline and route crude directly to refineries in the U S  Gulf Coast  Protesters have included actress Shailene Woodley and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein  who authorities say is part of a group under investigation for illegally spray painting construction equipment at the site   Our indigenous people have been warning for 500 years that the destruction of Mother Earth is going to come back and it s going to harm us   said David Archambault  tribal chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux   Now our voices are getting louder    On Tuesday  U S  Judge James Boasberg granted in part the tribe s request for a temporary restraining order to stop the project  and said he would decide by Friday whether to grant the larger challenge to the pipeline  which would require the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw permits  Protesters were disappointed that the judge did not shut down construction altogether  but savored a small win when the group of companies building the pipeline  led by Dallas based Energy Transfer Partners through its Dakota Access subsidiary  agreed to stop some work until the final ruling  The pipeline was fast tracked by the U S  Army Corps of Engineers earlier this year  but the project has been dogged by protests since April  It was envisioned as a safer way to transport highly flammable oil extracted from the Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota  Montana and parts of Canada than on trains  In June  a  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP  train carrying crude oil derailed and burst into flames in Oregon  forcing the evacuation of a school and the closure of a highway  In 2013  a runaway train in Canada crashed  killing 47 people and destroying buildings in the Quebec town of Lac Megantic  DIGGING IN FOR THE LONG HAUL     The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is one of six reservations in the Dakotas that are all that remain of what was once the Great Sioux Reservation  which comprised all of South Dakota west of the Missouri River  including the Black Hills  which are considered sacred  according to the tribe s website  The tribe has 15 000 members in the United States including as many as 8 000 in North and South Dakota  The reservation covers about 9 300 square miles  24 087 square km   At campsites dotted with white tepees and colorful tents  many people prepared for the long haul   People are ready to stay through winter   said Allyson Two Bears  who sits on the tribe s emergency response team   Members of an Ojibwe tribe are helping to erect lodges capable of withstanding North Dakota cold  and people from as far away as London and South Korea have joined the protest  signing their names to a map at the campsite   The tribe has also enlisted the help of online petition website Change org  which helped it gather more than 250 000 signatures on a petition to stop the pipeline  Youth members of the tribe aged 6 to 25 ran a relay race from North Dakota to Washington  D C   to deliver the petitions  The protest and lawsuit by the Standing Rock Sioux are not the first efforts by Native American and environmental groups to stop or reroute planned pipelines through culturally or environmentally sensitive areas   Aboriginal Canadian and Native American groups have opposed the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada to Nebraska  along with other pipeline projects   Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has said he would approve TransCanada Corp s Keystone XL pipeline proposal if elected  reversing a decision by the administration of President Barack Obama to block it over environmental concerns  TransCanada has sued the U S government to reverse Obama s rejection of the pipeline  The Standing Rock Sioux have hired a political campaign director to publicize their actions to stop the North Dakota pipeline   They ve been making really good use of social media as part of this and that has actually changed the way Native American activism takes place   said Katherine Hayes  chair of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis St  Paul  The Standing Rock Sioux sued in July  Last month  celebrity activists joined about 100 members of the tribe outside a Washington  D C   courthouse where hearings were being held  while others demonstrated in North Dakota  Over the weekend of Sept  3  protesters broke through a wire fence in an attempt to chase bulldozers grading the land  confronting pipeline security staff and guard dogs in clashes that at times became violent  Actress Susan Sarandon  who joined the Washington protest  said she was there to help publicize the tribe s cause   
 These kinds of things happen when people don t have a voice   Sarandon said  referring to the government s decision to fast track the project   We have to give them a voice  ",2016-09-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/north-dakota-pipeline-fight-gives-spark-to-native-american-activism-424923,424923

In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 20 is up 4 6  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Union Pacific has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 20   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Union Pacific s payout ratio is 40   which means it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  UNP expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  9 06 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 14 54  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that UNP is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-union-pacific-unp-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200380503,200380503

154886,376402,UNP,Slow pace of rail recovery stirs fear of future woes  ,news,"By Susan Taylor and Solarina Ho TORONTO  Reuters    More than eight months after an extreme winter began snarling North American rail traffic  a Reuters analysis of industry data shows delays lingering  raising the risk of a second winter of chaos on the rails 
Across the continent s seven largest operators  trains ran almost 8 percent slower on average and sat idle at key terminals for nearly three hours longer in the second quarter than a year earlier  data from the main railroads  known as Class 1  show 
While Canada s rail operators have nearly recovered  many U S  operators lag far behind 
The concerns are sharpest in the U S  Farm Belt  with lawmakers fearful that the biggest crops on record may be slow to reach markets or could even rot 
Rail logjams contributed to the economic slowdown early in the year  rippling across corporate America and affecting everything from car makers to ethanol producers 
    Many experts blame an incomplete recovery from last winter s freight backlogs  coupled with record crops and rising competition with crude oil tankers for track space amid an economic recovery 
     It s like a sinking ship   you re bailing out at one end  but it s coming in the other end just as fast  if not faster   said Citigroup Global Markets transportation analyst Christian Wetherbee 
    Performance fell behind as loads grew  between April and June  U S  rail carload volumes grew 5 4 percent and intermodal traffic  which include shipments partly by rail  rose 8 percent  Association of American Railroads  AAR  data shows 
At the same time  the industry is producing  tremendous  margins  profit and cash flow  with some companies setting records  said rail analyst Tony Hatch 
The largest operators plan to spend about 18 to 20 percent of annual revenue this year on new terminals  track  sidings and equipment to help boost capacity and efficiency  according to Thomson Reuters data  That is slightly higher than recent average annual spending 
    Some shippers complain that spending hasn t been sufficient to meet demand  especially in bad weather  Still  many investment projects are multi year improvements that can t quickly fix traffic jams 
     We re criticized     because we haven t put infrastructure in to handle the growth  But then when you try to put infrastructure in  the not in my backyard lobby kicks in and says  We don t want you here   Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd  TO CP   N CP  Chief Executive Hunter Harrison said on a recent earnings conference call 
Over the four decades to 2000  the nation s major track system shrank by about half  in terms of miles of rails  according to the U S  Federal Highway Administration 
Although Berkshire Hathaway s  N BRKa   N BRKb  BNSF Railway Co is spending a record  5 billion this year  its performance lagged those of competitors last quarter  BNSF trains traveled 11 percent slower than year ago speeds  and stayed at terminals for 18 percent longer 
    Fadi Chamoun  an analyst at BMO Capital Markets  said BNSF is unlikely to recover until mid  to late 2015 due to the amount of work it must do 
    In recent years  BNSF accounted for some 50 percent of the entire rail industry s volume growth  analysts said  The company says it handles up to 15 percent of U S  intercity freight 
    BNSF declined to respond to Reuters  questions about its performance metrics  The Fort Worth  Texas based railway has said it is working closely with shippers to clear backlogs and adding track  locomotives and crews 
The other four U S  Class 1 railroads are CSX Corp  N CSX   Kansas City Southern  N KSU   Norfolk Southern Corp  N NSC  and Union Pacific Corp  N UNP  
Kansas City Southern and Norfolk Southern did not respond to requests for comment  CSX said it was investing in strategic capacity additions and was adding train crews and locomotives to restore performance and support growth  Union Pacific CEO Jack Koraleski told Reuters that the railroad s performance has been improving even as volumes have been increasing  adding that it has worked hard to address disruptions and customer issues 
Cowen   Co analyst Jason Seidl said winter exacerbated problems for the industry   As they were trying to dig out  the volumes took off   he said 
 
    ECONOMIC FALLOUT    
    In the United States  more than 40 percent of goods  valued at more than  550 billion  are shipped by railroad each year on some 140 000 miles of track  Canada s 30 100 miles of track carry half of the country s export goods 
    Frozen transportation links contributed to a nearly 3 percent contraction in the U S  economy during the first quarter  the New York Federal Reserve said last week 
    Lawmakers and the  395 billion agricultural industry fear that trains may fail to clear last year s record breaking crops in the Midwestern U S  Farm Belt  which could strand part of this summer s grain harvest 
 We re sounding the alarms right now   North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp told Reuters   We believe the 2014 crop could be taken off the fields and there won t be any place to store it  because of the lack of ability to move product by rail  
    BNSF and Canada s CP Rail operate the main rail networks in North Dakota  where farmers vie for space with some 700 000 barrels per day of crude oil shipped by rail from the state s Bakken Shale 
     You can t see these massive increases in crude by rail and not appreciate that they are creating problems for moving agricultural products   Heitkamp said 
Members of Congress  utility companies  the United States Department of Agriculture and others are asking the U S  rail regulator  the Surface Transportation Board  for help 
 With remaining grain in storage due to the backlog  grain elevators in some locations  such as South Dakota and Minnesota  could run out of storage capacity during the upcoming harvest  requiring grain be stored on the ground and running the risk of spoiling  The projected size of the upcoming harvest creates a high potential for loss   USDA Under Secretary Edward Avalos wrote to the regulator this month 
Utility Xcel Energy said coal deliveries to a key Midwest facility were behind schedule 
 When we run out of coal  the plant can t produce electricity  We are right in the middle of summer when air conditioning load creates our highest levels of electric demand   Xcel Chief Executive Ben Fowke wrote in a letter to the STB at the end of July 
Since an April 10 hearing on rail service  the STB has issued several orders  primarily involving CP and BNSF  The most recent directive  issued in June  required the two railways to publicly file their plans to resolve their backlog on grain orders and provide a weekly update on grain car service  It declined to comment on complaints or its plans 
Earlier this month  the Canadian government ordered Canadian National Railway Co  TO CNR   N CNI  and CP to further boost regulated grain shipments  in an effort to prevent a repeat of last season s backlog 
Recent University of Minnesota data showed that transportation bottlenecks cost the state s soybean  corn and spring wheat farmers nearly  100 million between March and May 
    United Parcel Service Inc  N UPS   the world s largest courier company  said that  very poor  railroad performance last quarter raised its costs  Even passenger service Amtrak has been affected  with some of the trains it runs on Class 1 tracks falling far behind schedule 
Canada s biggest rails  CN and CP  operated their trains at speeds 4 7 percent and 3 percent slower in the second quarter than year ago levels respectively  better than most U S  rivals 
CN said its ability to avoid Chicago  a hub notorious for bottlenecks  helped its sector leading recovery  In 2009  CN bought a rail network that encircles Chicago  the Elgin  Joliet and Eastern Railway Co 
 
    CHICAGO BLUES
    Chicago s third snowiest winter on record severely tangled traffic at a hub that handles one quarter of the nation s freight by rail and has recently become a major conduit for Bakken crude 
Data from Union Pacific shows its trains idled in Chicago for an average 65 hours in February  around double the typical time for much of 2013 
Following a severe 1999 blizzard that paralyzed trains for days  government and railroads launched a  3 8 billion plan to improve the Chicago system 
That s not a quick solution for the industry s woes 
 It takes a long time for new lines and new terminals to get built  and additional locomotives to be delivered and additional crews to be trained   said Steve Ditmeyer  an adjunct professor at Michigan State University s Railway Management Program 
 There s a time lag that the railroads cannot snap their finger and  all of a sudden  get out of the current problem

154887,376403,UNP,Bid report boosts CSX stock  but deal chances seen remote,news,"By Nick Carey and Diane Bartz
CHICAGO  Reuters    Shares of No  3 U S  railroad CSX Corp  N CSX  rose nearly 10 percent on Monday following a report of a rebuffed takeover bid by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd  TO CP   but analysts said any such deal would face significant regulatory and other hurdles 
 You could make the argument that there is not much overlap between the two networks and between their businesses   said Jim Corridore  head of industrials equity research at Standard   Poor s   But they would face significant hurdles of getting a merger passed by the U S  Surface Transportation Board  STB   
Any merger would require STB approval 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the No  2 Canadian railroad made a bid last week for Jacksonville  Florida based CSX  which rejected the offer  Both companies declined to comment 
CSX shares closed up  1 76 or nearly 6 percent at  31 70 
Shares of Canadian Pacific were not traded Monday in Canada as markets were closed for a holiday  They were up 1 percent in trade on the New York Stock Exchange  Elsewhere in the sector  Kansas City Southern shares were up 2 percent and Norfolk Southern Corp was trading up nearly 3 percent 
In a client note  Cowen   Co analyst Jason Seidl wrote that Canadian Pacific could theoretically team up with hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and go directly to CSX shareholders 
In 2012 activist investor William Ackman  who runs Pershing Square  recruited Hunter Harrison  who had previously been chief executive officer of Canadian National Railway Co  TO CNR   as CEO of Canadian Pacific 
Seidl said any near term deal was unlikely since shippers and regulators were  disenchanted  with the rail industry because of service and capacity problems 
Harrison has indicated mergers could improve service  He has overseen an ongoing and widely praised restructuring at the railroad 
 Canadian Pacific is going through a huge restructuring  so the timing of potentially taking on the complexities of a merger like this is puzzling   S P s Corridore said 
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific  Class I  U S  railroads because of their extensive U S  holdings 
In client note  Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry wrote that STB merger rules for Class I railroads had  an arguably impossible hurdle  
 Therefore  in our opinion  the deal is a non starter  
Former STB chairman Charles Nottingham  now at law firm Husch Blackwell LLP  said any deal would be subject to a review potentially lasting up to four years 
Nottingham added that a merger would make CSX a stronger competitor to BNSF and No  1 U S  railroad Union Pacific Corp Analysts expect shippers to oppose any merger on the grounds that it could drive up prices and reduce competition 
 Shippers are generally opposed to any more consolidation in the railroad industry   said Bob Szabo of Van Ness Feldman LLP who has represented shippers 
Most of the other major railroads are seen opposing any Class I mergers 
 We stand with the consensus here   independent analyst Anthony Hatch wrote in a note   The risks   economic  operational and  enormously  political  especially now  outweigh the benefits   

But Cowen   Co analyst Seidl said   If a merger does occur  others will likely follow

154890,376406,UNP,Buffett may benefit as train lobby bids to weaken safety rule,news,"By David Morgan
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is set to be a chief beneficiary of a bid by Senate Republicans to weaken new regulations to improve train safety in the  2 8 billion crude by rail industry  a key cog in the development of the vast North American shale oil fields 
A series of oil train accidents  including the July 2013 explosion of a train carrying crude in Lac Megantic  Quebec  that killed 47 people  led U S  and Canadian regulators to announce sweeping safety rules in May  Among other things  U S  oil trains are required to install new electronically controlled pneumatic  ECP  brakes 
But in late June  the Republican controlled Senate Commerce Committee approved a measure to drop that requirement  and order years of new research to confirm the safety benefits of ECP brakes 
On Wednesday  the panel will decide whether to send the measure to the full Senate  setting the stage for a fight with Democrats who say the repeal would delay the use of feature that can help avoid catastrophic derailments and minimize the consequences of accidents that do occur 
The looming debate pits Democrats  federal regulators  safety advocates and environmentalists against the crude by rail industry  which claims that installing the brakes would slap an unnecessary  3 billion cost on railroads  oil refiners and other owners of rolling stock  and potentially jeopardize safety 
BNSF Railway Co  the No  2 U S  railroad  which Buffett owns through his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   N BRKa  holding company  is the leading U S  railroad for crude oil shipments  controlling three quarters of the carload volume in 2013  Along with CSX Corp  N CSX   it s also associated with the most oil train accidents  according to a Reuters analysis of incident reports 
Environmental groups estimate that 25 million Americans live near tracks traversed by crude oil shipments  making ECP brakes and other federal requirements essential to ensuring safety  Because the brakes act simultaneously on all cars and locomotives  they give train operators greater control and allow trains to stop more quickly than conventional air brakes  which slow rail cars in succession  advocates say 
 To walk away from what we know to be the best technology is pretty crazy   said Sean Dixon  an attorney with clean water advocacy group Riverkeeper 
Democrats will try to strike out the ECP amendment by offering a measure of their own when the committee meets on Wednesday  according to an aide   If the attempt fails  Democrats expect to fight the amendment on the floor of the Senate   
But the rail industry says the equipment is unreliable and could jeopardize safety  while further eroding the competitiveness of transporting oil by rail  which is already  5 to  10 a barrel more expensive than pipeline transmission 
ECP brakes are made mainly by two U S  based manufacturers    New York Air Brake  the U S  unit of Germany s Knorr Bremse AG  and Wabtec Corp  While a New York Air Brake official said ECP technology is reliable  the company has said that ECP brakes aren t a solution for oil trains because most derailments are caused by a broken track  wheel or axle  and ECP brakes can t stop an accident once a train starts to derail 
     It s the wrong solution for the problem   company president Mike Hawthorne told Reuters 
    Wabtec officials did not return phone calls   
    RAIL LOBBYING IN FULL SWING
    The most forceful lobbying against ECP brakes has come via the Association of American Railroads  a trade group that represents more than 20 freight railroad companies  including BNSF and CSX  Congressional staff said 
    AAR s aim  is anything that results in delaying  diluting or ultimately overturning the regulation   one Democratic Senate aide said 
    AAR has spent  14 5 million since 2012 lobbying Congress and the administration  including topics related to the crude by rail business  according to Senate records reviewed by Reuters 
    Among individual railroads  BNSF was the top lobbyist  having spent  12 7 million since 2012  Buffett also has a small stake in oil refiner Phillips 66  N PSX   an owner of oil tank cars that has spent  6 4 million lobbying Congress 
    BNSF s closest lobbying rival is  Union Pacific  Corp  N UNP  at  7 5 million  Canadian National Railway Co  TO CNR   CSX  and  Norfolk Southern  Corp  N NSC  have each spent between  3 million and  4 million during the same period  Union Pacific is the biggest U S  railroad  while CSX is third and Norfolk Southern is fourth 
    The records don t break down how much these companies spent specifically on oil train regulations and related issues 
BNSF lobbies the government on a range of issues  and crude by rail represents a small part of those efforts  spokesman Michael Trevino said  He also said the company supports the study and testing of ECP brake technology before implementation   
Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment  A Phillips 66 spokesman said the refiner is committed to being a  safety leader  and will comply with the new oil train standards 
    AAR has asked the U S  Department of Transportation to throw out the brake requirement and enhance other security measures involving tank cars  AAR President and Chief Executive Officer Edward Hamberger declined to comment because the group s appeal is pending  An AAR official said the group made sure lawmakers had  pertinent information  about the issue 
 
    CRUDE BY RAIL BOOM
    The series of oil train explosions in recent years follows a boom in U S  shale oil production  notably in the Bakken region of North Dakota  Bakken crude has helped reduce U S  dependence on foreign oil but is also considered more volatile and flammable than heavier crudes  
    Because the landlocked Bakken region is not easily accessed by oil pipelines  rail provides the main transportation route  The result has been a bonanza in the crude by rail business  Shipments surged to more than 350 million barrels in 2014 from less than 680 000 barrels in 2008  according to industry data 
    BNSF has been the biggest beneficiary  In 2013  the railroad hauled 324 206 carloads of crude oil  about three quarters of the industry s total volume of 435 560 carloads  according to data provided by the company and AAR 
    But BNSF also has been involved in six of the 18 U S  oil train derailments since the Lac Megantic disaster  second only to CSX  which has had seven  The latest BNSF derailment was in Heimdal  North Dakota  on May 6  Ten cars left the rails  The crude caught fire  forcing the town of 40 to evacuate 
    The Transportation Department disputes the industry s claim that the new regulations would cost  3 billion  over 20 years  officials say the cost would be  492 million  offset by  426 million to  1 7 billion in benefits

154893,376409,UNP,Big Rail s little cousins find boon in U S  oil by rail bust,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw OLEAN  New York  Reuters    Amid the rolling mountains surrounding this quiet town in southwest New York state  tucked away on miles long stretches of underused rail tracks  hundreds of idle oil tank cars attest to the extent of fallout from oil s rout   The oil tank cars   a year ago sought after to haul crude from North Dakota to New Jersey   now stand idle as a result of two converging trends  the reversal in U S  shale oil production and the completion of new pipelines  They show how the pain from the slump in the oil by rail industry has spread far and wide  Big rail lines  such as Berkshire Hathaway owned BNSF Railways or  Union Pacific   NYSE UNP  are losing what used to be their fastest growing source of new traffic  refiners such as PBF Energy are left with millions of dollars worth of unused rolling stock  and leasing firms such as Trinity Industries and Greenbrier Companies Inc have seen monthly rates fall to a third of peaks above  2000 per car  There is one winner  though  Short line railroads from Utah to Pennsylvania are making millions of dollars every month by providing refiners  producers and traders a place to park their unused tank cars  Outside this town of 14 000  along sidings that once helped ship vast volumes of coal  lumber and other raw materials during the region s industrial heyday  the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad is now collecting fees for about 800 cars   They ve been here for about five months  and we hear rumors more are coming   Carl Belke  chief operating officer for the line  told Reuters   WNY P s main rail line is about 190 miles  306 km  long  By comparison  BNSF has 32 500 route miles in 32 states  Gennessee and Wyoming  the nation s largest short line rail road  is collecting as much as  5 a day on each of about 2 000 idle crude rail cars in Utah  the Midwest and Canada  according to chief commercial officer Michael Miller  The company is also storing up to 700 frac sand cars  as plummeting oil prices have pushed production into reverse for the first time in five years  Demand has been rising since late last year  accelerating further in the past three months  Miller said  Reading Blue Mountain   Northern Railroad and the North Shore railroads in Pennsylvania are also storing cars  according to company officials  Neither company would provide specific numbers  To be sure  the extra revenue offsets only some of the income lost because of a drop in traffic caused by declining coal use and slowing crude shipments    We d much rather be moving cars than storing them   Miller said   Still  rail car storage is a fast growing business  In addition to oil traffic decline  tens of thousands of cars may need to be retrofitted or replaced to meet tough new safety regulations    Clearly  the number of cars being displaced over the coming months exceeds the existing capacity for storage   Todd Cecil  vice president at Chicago based Iowa Pacific Holdings said in a July news release announcing its storage expansion plans  The short rail company also said it already had three unit trains in storage in Colorado and was planning to use its tracks in upstate New York  along with others  to capitalize on demand for up to 50 000 cars that it expects to come off the tracks as the new rules are phased in   IMPORTS AND PIPELINES Short line railroads have traditionally served as a temporary storage hub for underused rail cars  particularly in regions where industry has shut down or scaled back   Simply  they have the space   Barton Jennings  a professor of supply chain management at Western Illinois University  said   Many of these short lines have a one or two customers and they can utilize their sidings for storage  Also  they are located at the beginning or end of a trip  so it makes sense   Crude shipments by rail soared to 1 1 million barrels per day  bpd  in December 2014  or more than a tenth of total U S  production  from 20 000 bpd in 2009  but volumes have been falling since the start of this year  according to the data from the U S  Energy Information Administration   Graphic    Some of the decline may reflect lower demand from refiners such as PBF  which found it cheaper to import crude this year than to haul it by rail from North Dakota  where most traffic originates  While the firm has invested in new facilities to allow its two East Coast refineries to unload up to 210 000 bpd of crude oil from rail cars  it only ran about 60 000 bpd in the second quarter  less than its contractual amount  CEO Tom Nimbley told investors last month  Shipments are set to fall to as little as 40 000 bpd this quarter  Rival refinery Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  has also cut oil by rail shipments   We actually set cars on the siding  We brought imported crudes in the system   CEO Greg Garland recently told investors  In addition  construction of several new pipelines from North Dakota to a major storage facility in Cushing  Oklahoma  has been completed  providing a cheaper alternative for shippers and further reducing demand for tank cars  For the first time since 2012  pipeline shipments from North Dakota are due to overtake exports by rail  state data shows  If the slump in shipments and tank car glut persists companies could consider scrapping some cars  though analysts say it is unlikely  
 It s too big of a write off   said Taylor Robinson  president of PLG Consulting  which works with crude by rail firms  They will hold on to them and hope things improve  These are 30 40 year assets  ",2015-09-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/big-rail's-little-cousins-find-boon-in-u.s.-oil-by-rail-bust-359430,359430

154909,376425,UNP,Union Pacific  UNP  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Union Pacific  UNP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  33 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 73 billion  up 5 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 52  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific 
For Union Pacific  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of  2 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 15  delivering a surprise of  2 87  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Union Pacific doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/union-pacific-unp-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376658,200376658
154910,376426,UNP,Will Union Pacific  UNP  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Union Pacific  UNP   which belongs to the Zacks Transportation   Rail industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This railroad has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 47  
For the last reported quarter  Union Pacific came out with earnings of  2 15 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 09 per share  representing a surprise of 2 87   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 94 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 98 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 06  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Union Pacific lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Union Pacific currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 77   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 24  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-union-pacific-unp-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200377175,200377175

What s Next for Union Pacific

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Union Pacific was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

154934,376450,UNP,Wisconsin Reveals Oil Train Routes For First Time,news,"By    The sudden boom in oil production from North Dakota s Bakken Shale deposits has fueled a nationwide increase in crude by rail transport and associated accidents and has prompted heated debate about publicizing rail routes companies use  The debate centers over which is more important  security for the cargos in transit or the public s right to know 
Wisconsin is the latest state to weigh in on the matter and it chose the public s right to know when it recently revealed the routes and counts of trains carrying the volatile Bakken oil through the state  In doing so Wisconsin rejected arguments from the rail industry  and formerly the federal government  that this information should only be released to those with a  need to know  and not the general public to prevent terrorist acts 
Last month  the U S  Department of Transportation  DOT  said that details about volatile oil train shipments are not sensitive security information  ordering railroads that ship more than 1 million barrels of Bakken oil a day to report to state officials the routes and volumes of oil that trains are carrying so that emergency responders can better prepare for accidents   
State officials in New York and North Dakota are still weighing whether the restrictions on the information would violate their state public record laws and whether disclosing the information would threaten security more than publishing it 
 I think it s a valid argument  because if you pop some of those off in a heavily populated area  I don t know how many lives would be lost   Edward McConnell  mayor of Casselton  North Dakota where an oil train derailed and exploded in December but didn t injure anyone  told the IBTimes in May   It could be horrific  
The Wisconsin documents  obtained first by DeSmogBlog through the state s Public Records Act  show that of three companies shipping more than 1 million barrels a day of North Dakotan oil through the state  Burlington Northern Santa Fe  BNSF  transports the most  along the Mississippi River  the state s western edge  For the week of June 5 to June 11  the rail company moved 39 oil trains along the river  more than 3 million barrels of oil  the documents show 

State officials from Montana and Washington have also supported the public release of oil train information  asking railroads to publish the records  while California  New Jersey  Virginia  Minnesota and Colorado have agreed to keep the information confidential over security concerns cited by railroads BNSF  CSX  NYSE CSX  and Union Pacific  NYSE UNP   according to the Associated Press 
Matt Landon  an activist with the Vancouver Action Network  said Wednesday that the argument that the information is security sensitive just doesn t make sense 
 People can see those rail cars  the oil trains   he said  Landon organized a group of train watchers to estimate the amount of volatile oil passing through Vancouver  Washington by counting the trains  clearly designated with placards 
 The fact that you can see it is one thing and also  communities need to be involved in risk assessment  and they need to have situational awareness to be able to do this assessment   Landon said   By not having all the information about risks  even if they are just passing through  that s not complete information  
Since July 6 marked the one year anniversary of the worst of the recent accidents  a Quebec oil train disaster that killed 147 people  groups like Landon s  climate focused 350 org and Forest Ethics have organized an  oil train week of action   including marches and protests  They are protesting at DOT and Federal Railroad Administration offices across the country Thursday and Friday  with the message   No exploding oil trains  ",2014-07-09,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/wisconsin-reveals-oil-train-routes-for-first-time-294016,294016

155024,376540,UNP,Railroads Should Continue To Prosper On Multiple Tailwinds,opinion,"After being laid low by declining coal shipments for the last few years  stocks in the railroad space performed well over the past year  The outlook for coal shipments has notably improved  given the favorable regulatory backdrop under the current administration 
The improvement can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to this key revenue generating commodity in the final quarter of 2017  For example  at Norfolk Southern Corp   NSC  coal revenues  freight  increased 5 7   while the same at CSX Corp   CSX  rose 4  year over year  At Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   revenues improved 115  at the energy segment on the back of impressive performances at Frac Sand and Crude Oil units 
You can see 
Railroads are expected to perform well in the first quarter of 2018 as well with coal continuing to show improvements  In fact  under the Trump administration  the coal industry is seeing better days  In a bid to revive the industry  the President has made it clear that he intends to relax regulations that were detrimental to its prospects 
Rising natural gas prices also bode well as far as demand for coal is concerned  Since revenues from coal account for a significant portion of railroads  top line  any positive development toward the commodity augurs well for the sector 
Intermodal Strength Augurs Well
The intermodal unit is another key source of revenues for railroads  In the fourth quarter of 2017  the intermodal unit performed reasonably well for the key railroads  For example at Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP   UNP   freight revenues from the segment increased 4  year over year  At Norfolk Southern  intermodal revenues rose 14 5  year over year  At Canadian Pacific Railway Company  CP   intermodal revenues increased 7  
In fact  intermodal volumes increased significantly in 2017 after a lackluster 2016  According to the Intermodal Association of North America  IANA   intermodal volumes improved 5 8  year over year in the final quarter of 2017  Growth on the international front contributed to the impressive performance of this key segment in 2017 
In fact  according to many market watchers  the segment is expected to perform strongly in the current year as well driven by a significant rise in international business 
New Tax Law a Huge Positive
On Dec 22  2017  Trump signed the much anticipated tax bill into law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   Under the  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package  corporate tax rates have been slashed significantly  The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow  which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks 
Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate  the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence  which was not allowed earlier  This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures 
As a result  their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  For example  Norfolk Southern expects the effective tax rate to come down to around 24  from 35 4  recorded in 2017 
Uptick in Shareholder Friendly Activities Likely
The likes of Union Pacific  Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company  CNI  have already announced dividend hikes this year  A further increase in shareholder friendly activities  dividends as well as buybacks  is likely in the wake of the massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills  more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others 
Improvement in Operating Ratio Another Positive
Operating ratio  defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  is an important metric to gauge the performance of railroads  The lesser the value of operating ratio the better  as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks 
In fact  many key railroads witnessed improvement with respect to the metric in the final quarter of 2017  At Norfolk Southern  the metric improved 150 basis points last year on a year over year basis  Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65  by 2020 or even earlier  Annual productivity savings in excess of  650 million are expected by 2020 
Further  efforts of railroads to drive bottom line growth through cost cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space  Moreover  the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety and enhance productivity are also encouraging 
To Conclude
We expect railroads to perform well going forward on the back of these positives  Moreover  a strong U S  economy supports the bullish case for railroads  as it implies that more goods are being transported across the country 
We believe that in light of factors like better coal and intermodal volumes  Trump s pro coal stance and industrial growth  investors should look at stocks in the space with renewed interest

155025,376541,UNP,Factors That Could Hinder The Railroad Industry Upturn,opinion,"There is no doubt that the new tax law has been a big positive for railroads and should be instrumental in driving growth for the industry  The new tax law apart  other factors like a buoyant U S  economy and intermodal growth act as major tailwinds for this key sector 
These positives notwithstanding  there are a few factors that raise concerns for railroads  Let s dig deep on the subject 
Sluggish Automotive Production   A Key Challenge
Weakness in the automotive sector has been hurting railroads for quite some time  with domestic production declining substantially  The scenario was not vastly different in the final quarter of 2017 as well  Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP   UNP  and Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC   NSC  were hurt by soft automotive volumes 
What s worse is that the situation is unlikely to improve in the current year 
Union Pacific on its fourth quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full year 2018 are projected at 16 9 million units  reflecting a 2  decline from the 2017 levels  Norfolk Southern  meanwhile  said that it expects automotive volume to lag vehicle production in the United States 
These disappointing commentaries on the automotive sector do not bode well for railroads  As a significant portion of revenues is accounted for by this key sector  weakness pertaining to automotive production in the United States is a major headwind for railroads 
Service Issues
CSX Corporation  NASDAQ CSX   CSX  was plagued by service disruptions last year  which severely dented its operations  However  the railroad took measures to combat the issue  The Precision Scheduled Railroading system  implemented by the company s former CEO  E  Hunter Harrison  seems to be paying off  The system generated efficiency related savings to the tune of  460 million in 2017 
However  service issues now seem to be hurting Canadian railroad operator  Canadian National Railway Company  CNI   In fact  the company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months  which have hurt its operational performance  Further  oilfield service major  Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  s  HAL  statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National s service delays have been affecting its bottom line  underlines the gravity of this situation 
Additionally  rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited s  CP  commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects  unless resolved quickly 
Canadian National announced a change at its helm  in March 2018  in order to primarily address the service issues  The new CEO  interim  has apologized to its customers for the service woes  He has promised an improvement on the service front  However  in the event of management change failing to yield the desired results  the stock would be hurt further 

NAFTA
NAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States  Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers  NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariffs among the three nations  However  President Trump has in fact threatened to withdraw from the agreement  if the negotiations  which are currently in progress  fail to yield the desired results  He believes that it is a bad deal  not in favor of American workers 
The uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  continues to hurt railroads  especially the ones like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   A significant portion of Kansas City Southern s revenues come from U S  Mexico shipment  In fact  many railroads including Kansas City Southern are not in favor of the U S  scrapping NAFTA  They believe that such a move might put pressure on supply chains  jobs and consumers apart from having adverse political implications 
However  the President has stuck to his guns and imposed a deadline of May 1 pertaining to the NAFTA negations  Beyond that date  there will be imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada 
Railroads would be hoping for a favorable resolution to the issue as an unfavorable development on this key issue might dampen their prospects severely 
Other Headwinds
President Trump s plans to shift focus to traditional energy businesses such as coal is aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads  This is because the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal 
However  even if the Obama era Clean Power Plan  CPP  is repealed  as wished by the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   coal revenues might not pick up  In the current year  the EIA predicts coal production to be 736 million short tons  MMst   down 5  year over year 
Moreover  many are not in favor of repealing the CPP due to fears of environmental hazards among others  Furthermore  the process of repealing CPP is time consuming  With uncertainty regarding CPP S fate  a major overhang on railroad shares would remain until there is clarity on this key issue Even if legislative and regulatory measures hindering the coal industry come into effect more vigorously  the commodity s long term competitive position has materially been weakened by the abundant and largely cheap natural gas supplies  In other words  railroads will benefit from  some incremental improvements in coal shipments  but the long term trend is in the opposite direction

At Union Pacific  earnings per share and revenues increased 10 1  and 5 5   respectively  year over year  Whereas at Kansas City Southern  both metrics grew 23 2  and 10 3   respectively  You can see Price PerformanceThe buoyant performance of railroad stocks in 2017 is well reflected by its price performance  It surged 30 4   significantly outperforming the S P 500 Index s 19 6  rally 

We expect the sector to continue performing well in the current year  The factors contributing to this positive scenario are as follows Coal and Intermodal RevenuesCoal is considered a key revenue generating commodity for railroads  With Trump s presidency  the coal industry is seeing better days  In a bid to revive the industry  the president intends to relax regulations that were hurting its prospects Rising natural gas prices are also favorable to boosting demand for coal  Moreover  per the U S  Energy Information Administration  coal production in the country is likely to increase by 2018  Since revenues from coal significantly drive the railroads  top line  any positive development for the commodity augurs well for the sector Coal aside  the intermodal space is a key revenue source for railroads  which improved by leaps and bounds in 2017  Per the Intermodal Association of North America  intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate during the third quarter of 2017  In fact  intermodal shipments are expected to expand   strengthening the top line for railroads in turn Improved U S  EconomyRecovery of U S  economy is also anticipated to pave way for the railroads  progress  Notably  U S  GDP is expected to climb   higher than the level achieved in the past couple of years  Generally  a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States Per the Commerce Department s latest report  the inland economy appreciated at a 3  decent annual rate implying a better economic scenario  Moreover  this reading was above the consensus estimate of 2 6  The New Tax LawTrump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth presidential agendas such as a vital corporate tax cut and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy  Given the capital intensive nature of railroads  this policy seems a huge vantage point for the sector  Under the current legislation  corporate taxes have been reduced to 21  from the previous 35   Also by dint of the revised law  companies will be able to immediately subtract capital expenditures from the taxable income in the year of their occurrence  
As a result  their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  This in fact leaves more cash in hand for these companies to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others Moreover  the amended tax law has prompted several companies to hike their quarterly dividend payouts  Companies like Canadian National Railway Co    NYSE CNI    CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   and Union Pacific Corp  have raised dividends earlier this year  indicating financial prosperity  Further  we expect this new law to enhance these shareholder friendly activities Zacks Industry Rank Highlights the Bright PictureThe Zacks Industry Rank of 64  of 250 plus groups  carried by the Zacks Rail Industry also emphasizes the optimistic sentiment revolving around railroad stocks  This favorable rank places the companies within the top 25  slot of the Zacks industries We classify our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  Using a week s rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade Click here to know more  About Don t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year  giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more  Those gains  however  came with serious volatility and risk  Bitcoin sank 25  or more 3 times in 2017 Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly ",2018-03-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/railroad-stocks-look-set-to-perform-well-in-2018-heres-why-200296979,200296979

155062,376578,UNP,UNP Or NSC  Which Railroad Is Better Placed Pre Q1 Earnings ,opinion,As the Q1 earnings season is just round the corner  market experts are preparing to compare estimates with actual outcomes  Right now  investors are looking to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter  This is because an earnings beat positively impacts the stock price In fact  the projection regarding Q1 is very encouraging  Per the latest   the bottom line for S P 500 companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 16  on a year over year basis  Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7 4   The report further predicts that 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors will end the Q1 earnings season with the bottom line improving year over year One of those sectors is   wherein the top and bottom line are expected to increase 7 4  and 14 5   respectively  Notably  this highly diversified sector includes railroads and airlines among others Given this backdrop  it is not a bad idea to indulge in a comparative analysis of key railroads   Union Pacific Corporation   NYSE UNP   and Norfolk Southern Corporation   NYSE NSC      ahead of their respective Q1 earnings reports  Norfolk Southern is slated to report on Apr 25  while Union Pacific is scheduled to unveil its earnings numbers a day later As both railroads are on the same footing  carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   we use certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned ahead of the Q1 reporting cycle  You can see  Price Performance When considering price performance in a year s time  Union Pacific clearly scores over Norfolk Southern  Union Pacific has gained 24 1   higher than its  s 14 8  rally  Meanwhile  Norfolk Southern has gained 13 9  in the same time frame  Valuation Compared with the S P 500  the broader industry is overvalued  The industry has an average trailing 12 month P B ratio   which is commonly used for valuing railroads because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next   of 3 8  This is a tad higher than the S P 500 average of 3  7  Coming to the two stocks under consideration  with a P B ratio of 2 3 Norfolk Southernis undervalued compared with the S P 500 and the industry  However  Union Pacific scores poorly on the valuation front and is overvalued compared with the industry and the S P 500  with a P B ratio of 4 2  Consequently  this Omaha  NE based railroad operator is pricier than its Norfolk  VA based counterpart  Dividend Yield The new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   which reduces corporate tax rate significantly  is a huge positive for railroads  This apart  the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of occurrence  which was not allowed earlier  This aspect hugely favors railroads as they invest substantially in capital expenditures The massive savings prompted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is favorable for shareholder friendly activities like dividend payments and buybacks  In fact  both Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have hiked the respective dividend payouts this year  Also  other railroad stocks like Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI   and CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   have announced dividend hikes this year Coming back to the two stocks under consideration  Union Pacific s dividend yield over a year is 2 2   With a dividend yield of 2 18   Norfolk Southern shareholders fetch a slightly lower dividend yield than its larger rival  Earnings History and ESP Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  Norfolk Southernhas delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 7 2   Union Pacificemerges second best in this respect  having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 3 3  However  the  scenario is quite a contrast  with Union Pacific s reading at  0 22  and Norfolk Southern s at  2 56  ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Norfolk Southernholds an edge over Union Pacific  when considering a more detailed earnings history and valuation  Nevertheless  Union Pacific is superior when considering dividend yield and price performance Additionally  Union Pacific has a positive ESP reading unlike Norfolk Southern  Although  both stocks have a the same Zacks Rank and seem to be evenly matched  Union Pacific is preferable ahead of earnings  since it holds a clear edge in the Earnings ESP stakes According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3 or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market

155063,376579,UNP,Railroad Industry Outlook   April 2018,opinion,"Stocks in the railroad space are being aided by momentum in the U S  economy  with more goods being transported across the country 
The market is expected to continue its winning streak  banking on a rise in wages and more confident consumers  Moreover  the new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  should boost profits further and drive stock prices of the participants of this key sector higher 
The robust financial health of railroads is reflective of the improved scenario for its players  The rebound has been aided by the much improved scenario pertaining to the intermodal unit  a key revenue generating sector for railroads 
The sector has bounced back after a disappointing 2016  Intermodal revenues are likely to grow this year as well  In fact  intermodal shipments are expected to expand   strengthening the top line for railroads in turn  Improvement pertaining to another key metric   operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues    is another positive for railroads 
In view of the above tailwinds  the fourth quarter earnings season had been a good one for railroad stocks  Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes  railroad companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter  We note that a number of companies in the space   including prominent names such as Norfolk Southern Corp   NSC   CSX Corp   CSX   Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU  and Genesee   Wyoming  Inc   GWR    delivered an earnings beat in the quarter 
Volume Growth Likely to Drive Railroads in Q1
The stocks are likely to perform impressively in the first quarter of 2018 driven by volume growth  For example  the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  railroad   Union Pacific Corp   UNP    expects volume growth in the soon to be reported quarter to increase in the low single digit range  Strong performance at the intermodal unit is expected to aid results  You can see 
Efforts of railroads to check costs should boost their bottom lines further  For example  at the 2018 Investor Conference held in March  CSX stated that its transition to precision scheduled railroading is progressing well  The new model will lead to top line growth on the back of volume and pricing gains from the merchandise and intermodal segments  Moreover  scheduled railroading is anticipated to provide greater agility to the coal markets  This  in turn  will drive growth 
Railroads should continue to see operating ratio related improvements in the first quarter of 2018  The lesser the value of operating ratio the better  as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends buybacks 
In fact  the transportation sector  which includes railroads  is expected to see double digit year over year earnings growth in the first quarter  For more details about the earnings of this sector and others  please read our  report 
Zacks Industry Rank Highlights Headwinds
Despite the above mentioned tailwinds  the Zacks Industry Rank   247  of 250 plus groups  carried by the  highlights that the industry is not bereft of headwinds  This unfavorable rank places the companies within the bottom 4  slot of the Zacks industries 
We classify our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Using a week s rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade

The Concerns
It is a well documented fact that the fortunes of railroads are tied to coal  since the latter is an important revenue generating commodity for the sector  Despite President Trump s pro coal attitude  the coal industry is not yet out of the woods  In fact  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA    coal production is expected to be 736 million short tons  MMst   down 5  year over year 
The primary reasons for this are a drop in U S  coal exports and a decline in usage of coal in electricity generation in the United States  The struggles related to coal are likely to hurt railroads in the first quarter  For example  Norfolk Southern stated at the J P  Morgan Aviation  Transportation and Industrials conference that coal volumes had declined 6  as of Mar 10  Naturally  any negative development for the commodity does not bode well for railroad operators 
Declining automotive volumes due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States  have been hurting railroads for the past few quarters and the story is unlikely to be different in the first quarter  Union Pacific on its fourth quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full year 2018 are projected at 16 9 million units  reflecting a 2  decline from the 2017 levels 
Moreover  service issues represent a major headwind for the sector and may hurt its customer base unless resolved quickly  CSX was badly hurt by such issues last year  Canadian railroad operator   Canadian National Railway Co   CNI    is the latest victim of operational problems  which are likely to hurt its first quarter results 
Moreover  uncertainty regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  represents a major overhang on shares of railroads  particularly those like Kansas City Southern  which generate a significant portion of revenues from U S  Mexico shipments  Other factors  like the weather related disruptions   like the ones last year which resulted in freight costs skyrocketing   and the dispute regarding the proposals concerning reciprocal switching  are further challenges for railroads 
Valuation Picture
The Zacks Rail industry is up 17 1  over the past year  modestly outperforming the S P 500 index s 15 5  gain in the same time period  The industry has struggled since January 9th  likely reflecting the NAFTA uncertainty 
The industry s valuation picture remains attractive  with multiples becoming a lot more reasonable following the recent sell off  The Zacks Rail industry currently trades 16 4X forward 12 month consensus EPS estimates  which is down from 19 4X back in December 2017  This compares to the current forward 12 month P E multiple of 17X for the S P 500 index 
Over the last 5 years  the industry has traded as high as 19 4X forward 12 month consensus estimates and as low as 13 4X  with a 5 year median of 16 4X  In other words  the industry is trading at the same level as the 5 year median

155097,376613,UNP,Buy 5 Railroad Operators With Strong Growth Potential,opinion,The diversified transportation sector  which includes airline companies  railroads  truckers and shippers  to name a few  recovered in the last quarter of 2017 after struggling for most of the year  An improving U S  economy  substantial surge in manufactured and retail goods  and a sharp rebound in a number of end markets are expected to fuel growth of the transportation sector  Of the various means of the U S  transport  freight railroad is an integral one   Railroads Prosper Due to Multiple TailwindsThe robust financial health of railroads bears testimony to the fact that the scenario has improved considerably for players in the sector  after being battered by coal related headwinds for the last few years In fact  the primary reason behind the turnaround in fortunes of this key industry can be attributed to an improvement in the coal related scenario  This is because coal is considered a key revenue generating commodity for railroads Moreover  prospects of the coal industry have brightened because of President Donald Trump s pro coal stance  wherein he has promised to relax emissions rules  Higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in global market have also given a boost to the demand for this key commodity  As the fortunes of most railroad operators depend on coal  any positive development related to this commodity augurs well for railroads Improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads  In fact  according to the Intermodal Association of North America  intermodal volumes registered the highest growth rate in the third quarter of 2017  Moreover  efforts of railroads to drive bottom line growth through cost cutting measures raise optimism in stocks from this space Growth Induced PolicesTrump s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish  The two pro growth agendas of Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U S  economy   The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35  to 20  is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years   A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland  Therefore  a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Moreover  the tax proposal offers to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate Capital Intensive Nature of Rail TransportationTransportation stocks  mainly railroads  invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital intensive in nature  In the current scenario  capital expenditures cannot be tax deducted in the year they are incurred  Consequently  U S  rail operators need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure  However  companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately  per the U S  tax overhaul  Naturally  this aspect hugely favors freight rail transports As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence  their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others Effect on Transportation SectorA thriving and improving economy also supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector  as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States  Improved global growth prospects and sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent  Easily available credit also strengthens the situation Momentum to ContinueIn fact  improvement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of this year  The rise in natural gas prices will also boost demand for coal  Moreover  per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   coal production in the United States will increase in 2018  Apart from coal  the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for transporters is intermodal  which has improved by leaps and bounds this year  In fact  intermodal shipments are expected to grow 4 2  in 2018 Stabilization of commodity prices has helped reignite investors faith in the transportation sector with the improvement in the economic conditions  Railroads should continue to witness an improvement pertaining to another key metric   operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  in 2018  The lesser the value of operating ratio  the better  as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through hike in dividends or share buybacks Rail Transport Industry

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  5 Dividend Raising Transports to Combat Market VolatilityThe U S  equity market has been on a roller coaster of late  In fact  Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1 033 points or 4 2  on Feb 8  Other major bourses   the S P 500 and the Nasdaq   also finished in the red on the same day In fact  this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1 000 points in a day after the 1 175 points decline on Feb 5  Following the latest U S  sell off  both the Dow as well as the S P 500 are officially into the correction territory  down more than 10  from the recent all time high reached in January The steep sell off was due to the stronger than expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years  These factors  in turn  triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected Furthermore  heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX    Wall Street s so called fear gauge   which currently is more than 30  near the highest level since August 2015  indicates bearish market prospects  Notably  any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market Given this backdrop  investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent  This is because such companies are financially stable and mature  and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions Transportation Stocks Riding HighA sector that boasts well paying stocks in terms of dividends  is the one having transportation stocks  Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017  due to various headwinds like back to back hurricanes  increased costs to name a few Also  the string of outperformances  in terms of earnings as well as revenues  by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines  American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp  in fourth quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly diversified   one of the 16 Zacks sectors  Factors Behind the ResurgenceRailroads are one of the most important sub groups in the transportation sector  After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal related winds  stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario Particularly with Donald Trump s presidency  the coal industry is witnessing better days  In fact  Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations  which were hurting its prospects  Apart from coal  the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads   intermodal   has improved by leaps and bounds lately Airlines   another important sub group in the broader sector   are also seeing good times now  courtesy of the improved demand for air travel  For 2018  the International Air Transport Association   IATA   predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry  This is much higher than the profitability forecast of  34 5 billion for the current year Moreover  package delivery companies like FedEx and United Parcel Service performed well on the back of e commerce growth in the most recent holiday season  This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports Trump s Tax Overhaul   A BoonOn Dec 22  2017  Trump signed the much anticipated tax bill into law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   Under the  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package  corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21  from 35   The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow  which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate  the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence  which was not allowed earlier  This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures  As a result  their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions For example  Delta  which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4  and 6  on a year over year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results  The company now expects earnings per share in the range of  6 35 to  6 70  previous outlook   5 35 to  5 70  Shareholder Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up PaceAs noted above  many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks  For example  United Continental Holdings   a key transportation player   announced a new buyback program late last year  Moreover  the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017 Following the new tax law  we expect an increase in these shareholder friendly activities from various transportation companies  Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills  more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases among others Dividend Paying Transports   A Prudent ChoiceIn view of the above mentioned tailwinds  we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one s portfolio  Moreover  picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario Consequently  we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space  which have a strong dividend paying history  Also  these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently  All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see Our first choice is  UPS  the world s largest express carrier  Markedly  UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally  UPS  board of directors cleared an approximately 10  hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share   3 64 annually  on Feb 8  The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7  2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20 The raised dividend highlights UPS  commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects  going forward Also  it has an impressive record with respect to dividends  The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999 Furthermore  the company s  of A highlights its short term attractiveness  Notably  the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp   which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company  Union Pacific Railroad Company On Feb 8  this railroad operator s board of directors a 10  hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share  annualized  2 92 per share   The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30  2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28 In fact  this is the company s second dividend hike in three months   In November 2017  the company had announced a 10  hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66 5 cents per share  We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law Additionally  the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years The next member in our list is also a railroad operator   Norfolk Southern   Last month  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share  annualized  2 88 per share  from 61 cents per share  annualized  2 44 per share   The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10  2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2 Moreover  it has an impressive record with respect to dividends  The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters  since inception in 1982 Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   About Zacks Equity ResearchZacks Equity Research provides

155099,376615,UNP,UNP Breakout Trade Review   20  Gain Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"We recently bought Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  as a breakout trade  held it for ten weeks  then sold for a  20  gain ahead of earnings  Continue reading to find out why we picked this stock for buy entry  and how we managed this trade for maximum profitability with low risk 
The chart pattern of transportation stock Union Pacific   UNP  first caught our attention in late October 2017 
At that time  the price of  UNP surged sharply higher  on heavier than average volume  after bouncing off key support of its 50 day moving average  50 day MA  
The 50 day MA had also crossed above the 200 day MA  following six months of basing action between  102 and  114 
But although the 50 day MA crossing above the 200 day MA is a bullish signal  it should not be used as an actual entry point because it s too obvious 
When buy signals are too obvious to the average stock market speculator  a short term pullback shakeout usually follows 
The moving averages pointed to a clear buy signal  but we needed to wait for a low risk entry point on the pullback 
Buying The Pullback For Low Risk Entry
On November 7  we listed  UNP as an official buy setup in The Wagner Daily 
Our plan was to buy Union Pacific shares with a limit order  on a pullback to near the rising 10 day MA 
If the 10 day MA failed to hold on a pullback  the 20 day exponential moving average  20 day EMA  was providing more support just below 
The chart below  taken directly from that day s report  shows the bullish trade setup at the time 

As expected   UNP pulled back and triggered our buy entry at  116 67 the next day 
The stock initially failed to hold above its 10 day MA following our buy entry 
However   UNP found support after a few brief  and typical  shakeouts below its 20 day EMA 
Union Pacific then consolidated in a tight  sideways range for a week before breaking out to fresh highs in late November  on increasing volume  
The buy entry  consolidation  and breakout is clearly displayed on the chart below 

Riding The Bullish Momentum
 UNP was an easy position to hold after the breakout because the uptrend that followed was smooth and steady 
The best breakout induced uptrends hold above their 10 day MAs after the bullish momentum gets under way 
Looking at the chart below  notice that  UNP held firmly above its 10 day MA throughout the entire advance 

As long as an uptrending stock remains above its 10 day MA  there is typically no reason to sell   let the winner ride the bullish momentum to maximize your gain 
But because the quarterly earnings report was scheduled for January 25  we eventually tightened our protective stop order on two thirds of the position size to lock in profits 
That sell stop order triggered on January 23  enabling Wagner Daily subscribers to lock in a solid 20  gain on most of the shares 
We initially planned to hold the remaining third of the winning position into earnings  but later felt the stock was too extended to take the risk 
As such  we sold the remaining shares on the January 24 open and secured another 20  gain on the rest of position 
Selling Union Pacific ahead of its earnings was a good move because  UNP opened about 6  lower on January 25  a little luck never hurts  
Managing Winners Into Earnings
With our style of stock trading  which combines swing and position trading  we usually aim to sell into strength when there is an extended rally ahead of an earnings report 
This is especially true when it s a well known large cap stock like  UNP 
Conversely  if a small to mid cap stock is breaking out from a first stage base and not extended on the monthly chart  we are a bit more aggressive with holding the position 
In this case  we prefer to sell partial shares into strength  then hold the remaining shares through earnings   but only IF overall market conditions are strong 
Regardless  there is no  one size fits all  solution to the question of whether to hold a stock through earnings 
Each situation is unique and a stock s reaction to earnings is always a craps shoot ",2018-02-15,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unp-breakout-trade-review-20-gain-ahead-of-earnings-200290753,200290753

155168,376684,UNP,5 Transportation Stocks That Escaped 2017 Sector Shortfall,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that the widely diversified transportation sector  which includes airline companies  railroads  truckers and shippers to name a few  has had a turbulent time in 2017 due to multiple headwinds  Issues ranging from customer dissatisfaction  high fuel costs  driver shortages  technological glitches and service disruptions due to hurricanes have let sector participants down at various times of the year 
Lets have a deeper look into the major headwinds that have hampered this sector 
Probably  the most infamous incident to have plagued the sector in 2017 was the David Dao incident at United Airlines  the wholly owned subsidiary of United Continental   NYSE UAL    on Apr 9  The passenger dragging episode drew flak from across the globe  resulting in multiple apologies from the company  Apart from United Airlines  customer dissatisfaction issues have also hurt other airline operators like Spirit Airlines   NASDAQ SAVE   
The rise in fuel prices also do not bode well for transportation stocks as expenses related to the commodity are one of the largest input costs for any sector participant  In fact  oil prices have increased more than 37  in the last three months  hitting a more than two year high of around  59 recently 
Additionally  the recent hurricanes disrupted operations of major sector participants  Consequently  airline operators like United Continental had to cancel multiple flights causing significant loss of revenues 
Hurricanes also hurt operations of major railroads like Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP   and Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC   by damaging important rail lines  Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters  Railroads have also been negatively impacted this year by weakness in the automotive sector due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States 
In 2017  technological glitches have hurt sector participants as well  Operations at FedEx Corp  s   NYSE FDX   subsidiary  TNT Express  were crippled by a cyberattack in June  The attack caused large scale service delays 
Due the above mentioned headwinds  the  is currently placed at the bottom among the 16 Zacks Classified sectors 
S P 500 Going from Strength to Strength
With the domestic economy on a solid footing  it is of little surprise that U S  stock markets are hitting all time highs on a fairly regular basis  The S P 500 also maintained its upward journey for 13 straight months through November  The benchmark index  in fact  hasn t seen a drop of at least 3  since Nov 7  2016  the longest stretch on record  The index had rallied more than 19  so far this year and is on track to record its best year since 2013 
In fact  strong economic growth has been responsible for this upsurge in the S P 500 Index  Bullish domestic data released recently are indicative of the healthy position of the U S  economy 
Per the Commerce Department s second estimate  the U S  economy expanded at a 3 3  pace in the third quarter  This represents an improvement from the annualized growth rate of 3 1  in the April to June period and the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014  Meanwhile  President Trump s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly  have added to the already buoyant scenario 
Transports Lag the S P 500 Index
While the S P 500 equity index has been on an uptrend  it has been a turbulent 2017 for the transportation stocks as enumerated above  Given this contrasting scenario  it is of little wonder that the sector has lagged the coveted S P 500 Index 
The recent   which on becoming a law is expected to aid transports significantly  is primarily responsible for the sector giving positive returns to investors this year   Despite this  it has not been a great year for the sector participants due to the headwinds mentioned above 
The Zacks transportation sector rallied 10 9  year to date compared with the broader S P 500 s gain of 20 3  

5 Sector Outperformers in 2017
Despite the headwinds to have plagued sector participants  there are a few stocks in the sector which have given higher returns than the sector 
However  given the widely diversified transportation sector  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at such outperformers  To aid their search procedure  we have zeroed in on five such stocks 
The stocks  apart from having solid fundamentals  have large market capitalizations   This is because  focusing on such stocks is considered to be safe  Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions 
Our first choice is FedEx Corporation  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company offers customers a one stop source for global shipping  logistics and supply chain solutions  The company has an impressive expected earnings growth rate  next 3 to 5 years  of 12 8   which is higher than the industry s 11  
The company has a market capitalization of  63 95 billion and a  of A  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners 
However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score  Additionally  the stock has returned 34 9  year to date  Impressive performance during the current holiday season will boost the stock further   Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018  Be among the first to see our   
You can see  

 
Our next choice is Union Pacific Corporation  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  railroad operator is based in Omaha  NE  As the largest railroad in North America  Union Pacific connects the Pacific and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways 
The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter and current year earnings being revised 2  and 0 7  upward  respectively  over the last 60 days  Additionally  the stock has returned 29 9  year to date  The company has a market capitalization of  101 68 billion 
Moreover  railroads including Union Pacific are seeing good times under President Trump due to his pro coal stance  Trump is aiming to revive the coal industry by relaxing regulations which were hurting its prospects  As fortunes of railroads are tied to coal  any positive development pertaining to the commodity is a boost for railroad operators 
Additionally  railroads invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital intensive in nature  For example  Union Pacific has announced a  3 1 billion capital plan this year  which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity 
In the current scenario  capital expenditures cannot be tax deducted in the year they are incurred  However  companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately as per the provisions of the tax reform bill  Naturally  this aspect hugely favors railroads and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers 

 
Our next choice is also a railroad operator   Norfolk Southern Corporation  This Zacks Rank  3 company is based in Norfolk  VA  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter and current year earnings being revised 2  and 1 7  upward  respectively  over the last 60 days  Additionally  the stock has returned 34  year to date  The company has a market capitalization of  40 31 billion 
We are impressed by Norfolk Southern s focus on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  The company s cost cutting efforts to drive the bottom line are also encouraging  The company expects earnings per share to grow in double digits  compound annual growth rate  by 2020 

 
Airline behemoth Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   has also outperformed the transportation sector this year despite the headwinds  This Zacks Rank  3 company  based in Atlanta  GA  is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States and around the world 
The company has a decent record with respect to earnings per share  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters  The average beat is 1 6   Moreover  the stock has an impressive dividend paying history 
The stock has returned 14 3  year to date  Delta has a market capitalization of  39 39 billion  Moreover  the tax reform bill  on becoming a law is expected to aid airline stocks just like railroads 

 
Our list of sector outperformers in 2017 is rounded off by American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL    The company  headquartered in Fort Worth  TX  operates more than 6 700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe  This Zacks Rank  3 company has an impressive record with respect to earnings per share  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  The average beat is 3  
Additionally  the stock has returned 11 2  year to date  outperforming the sector despite the difficult year  The company has a market capitalization of  24 03 billion

155170,376686,UNP,4 Transportation Stocks That Could Beat The Market In 2018 ,opinion,"It is a well established fact that the widely diversified transportation sector including airline companies  railroads  truckers  shippers to name a few  has struggled for the better part of 2017  Sector participants have been plagued by a number of headwinds like disruptions from back to back hurricanes  the devastating earthquake in Mexico  declining automotive volumes  issues related to customer dissatisfaction and high costs  labor as well as fuel  The lackluster performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below  The chart clearly indicates that the sector has climbed only 8 8   underperforming the S P 500 Index  which appreciated 12 6  over the same period 
Uptrend Over the Last Few MonthsHowever  matters have been changing for the better over the past few months on the back of several tailwinds  We are optimistic about the fact that the sector has outperformed the S P 500 index in a month  It has gained 6 8  compared with the S P 500 index that advanced 3 5  over the same time frame 
Railroads Poised for a Great 2018Railroads have been benefiting since the beginning of 2017 after struggling for the past couple of years  The prime factors contributing to this improved scenario are increased coal and intermodal revenues Particularly with President Donald Trump s presidency  the coal industry is seeing better days  The President is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations  which were hurting its prospects The rise in natural gas prices is also favorable to boosting demand for coal  Moreover  per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   coal production in the United States will increase in 2018  Since revenues from coal contribute significantly to the railroads  top line  any positive development for the commodity means good news for the sector Apart from coal  the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads and intermodal  has improved by leaps and bounds this year  In fact  intermodal shipments are expected to grow   This in turn will drive the top line for railroads Moreover  railroads like Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP   have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year  indicating their financial prosperity  The solid financial status of these companies bodes well for 2018 Recovery of the U S  economy is also likely to pave the way for railroads  Notably  U S  GDP is expected to increase by   higher than what was achieved in the last two years  Generally  a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States The improved economic scenario is evident from the fact that in the third quarter of 2017  the domestic economy expanded at an impressive annual rate of 3   per the latest report from the Commerce Department  The reading was above the consensus estimate of 2 6  Trump s Tax Overhaul   A BoonThe biggest overhaul of the U S  tax code in 30 years is a positive for the transport companies and should propel the sector s growth in 2018  Corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35  to 21  as a result of this move Transportation stocks   mainly railroads and airlines   invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital intensive in nature  In the current scenario  capital expenditures cannot be tax deducted in the year they are incurred  Consequently  U S  companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure  However  companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately  per the U S  tax overhaul  Naturally  this aspect hugely favors transports As and when the companies are able to reduce capital expenses in the year of their occurrence  their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  This will in fact leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases among others Notably  FedEx Corp    NYSE FDX   has already indicated that it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant  Apart from railroads and package delivery companies  stocks belonging to the airline space  are also expected to be huge benefactors from the U S  tax overhaul  The capital intensive nature of the industry implies that the above mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should assist the carriers as well Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate  the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States Airlines  Profitability to Rise in 2018The International Air Transport Association unveiled a rosy view for carriers with respect to the profitability level for 2018  The research firm predicts global net profit of  38 4 billion for the industry  This is much higher than the 2017 profitability forecast of  34 5 billion  increased from the  31 4 billion predicted in June   This bright projection despite increased costs can be attributed to the strong demand for air travel The top line is predicted to come in at  824 billion next year compared with  754 billion  forecast in the current year  Cargo revenues are likely to increase to  59 2 billion for 2018  estimated revenues for 2017 are  54 5 billion  Per the forecast  6  air travel growth is expected in 2018 compared with 7 5  rise in 2017  This estimated figure for 2018 is however  above the average growth of 5 5  in the last 10 20 years The research firm has also predicted that the average net profit per departing passenger would be  8 90 in 2018 compared with  8 45 in 2017 Declining air fares have been hurting the top lines of carriers  Although low airfare brings good news for flyers  it is a bane to the airline companies  However  air fares are expected to rise in 2018  thanks to the likely oil price surge of  for Brent Crude  High air fares will boost the top lines of carriers Moreover  the bullish unit revenue forecasts projected by several carriers in the recent times reflect their easing revenue related woes  Notably  in December  JetBlue Airways   NASDAQ JBLU   provided a raised guidance for the fourth quarter  This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company now expects RASM in the range of down 0 5  to up 1 5   on a year over year basis   The

seat miles  RASM  a key measure of unit revenues  for the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase 1 2   higher than the previous guidance of a slight rise of up to 1 5    The progress in the condition of the sector is highlighted by the upgrade in the Zacks Industry Ranks of most components in the transportation space  For instance  the  division carries a bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 72  out of 250 plus groups   This favorable rank places the companies within the top 28  of the Zacks industries With things looking up for the transportation sector  we have zeroed in on four stocks with potential

All the above mentioned companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
The sector s impressive performance is not just limited to the third quarter  Stocks in the railroad space have in fact witnessed good times since the commencement of 2017 after struggling for the past couple of years  The 29 3  improvement in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index on a year to date basis bears testimony to bullishness surrounding railroads 
Factors Contributing to the Turnaround
In fact  improvement in the prospects of key units like coal and intermodal has been benefiting railroads since the beginning of this year  
Particularly with Trump presidency  the coal industry is seeing better days  The President is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations which were hurting its prospects  He has started to act on his promises made during the campaigning phase 
The rise in natural gas prices is also favorable to demand for coal  Moreover  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   coal production in the United States will improve in 2017 and 2018  Since revenues from coal contribute significantly to railroads  top line  any positive development for the commodity means good news for the sector 
Coal apart  the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads  intermodal  has improved by leaps and bounds this year  In fact  growth relating to intermodal volumes reached the highest levels in three years  in the third quarter of 2017 
Recovery of the U S  economy has also worked in favor of railroads  In fact  in the third quarter  the domestic economy expanded at an impressive annual rate of 3   according to the latest report from the Commerce Department  The reading was above the consensus estimate of 2 6   despite the turbulence caused by hurricanes 
This is also the first time since 2014 that the U S  economy expanded at 3  or above  on an annual basis  for two consecutive quarters  This supports the air of optimism surrounding railroads  Generally  a buoyant domestic economy results in an uptick in rail shipments of goods across the United States 
Good Times Likely to Continue in Q4
Railroad operations were severely hampered in the third quarter due to the natural calamities as important rail lines were severely damaged  However  operations at railroads have returned to normal  Consequently  the stocks are likely to perform impressively in the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by volume growth  Key units such as intermodal and coal are expected to continue performing well  and thereby aid results 
Efforts of railroads to check costs should boost their bottom lines further  For example  CSX Corp   CSX  expects its bottom line to expand between 20  and 25  in 2017  on a reported basis  over 2016 levels  driven by improved efficiencies 
Railroads should continue to see an improvement pertaining to another key metric   operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues    in the fourth quarter of 2017  Thelesser the value of operating ratio the better  as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends buybacks 
Riding on their solid financial health  many railroads including the likes of Union Pacific Kansas City Southern  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CP  and Canadian National Railway Ltd   CNI  have hiked their respective quarterly dividend payouts this year 
Some Roadblocks to Be Careful About in Q4
Despite the positives  there are a few factors that might hurt results in the fourth quarter  Evidently  weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the third quarter  due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States 
The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well  In fact  sales of U S  light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units  down approximately 3  on a year over year basis  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads 
Moreover  rising operating expenses due to the uptick in fuel prices are likely to limit bottom line growth of railroads in the fourth quarter

The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well  In fact  sales of U S  light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units  down approximately 3  on a year over year basis  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads 
Moreover  rising operating expenses due to the uptick in fuel prices are likely to limit bottom line growth of railroads in the fourth quarter

155207,376723,UNP,Transportation Stocks Surge As Senate Passes Tax Bill,opinion,"Shares of the major transportation companies surged on Dec 4  The uptick was primarily due to the Senate s approval of the biggest U S  tax overhaul in three decades by a 51 49 vote in the early hours of Dec 2 
Consequently  the Dow Jones Transportation Average   a price weighted average of 20 U S  transportation securities   ended the day 1 8  higher  thereby closing at 10 368 58  The Index includes railroads  truckers  marine transportation  delivery services and logistics companies  apart from the airlines  Hence  the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index can easily be considered as a true representative of the U S  transportation division 
With the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index performing exceptionally well  it was no surprise that most participants had a field day  In fact  stocks like FedEx Corp    NYSE FDX   and United Parcel Service   NYSE UPS   that dominate and define the  gained 3 6  and 2 8  on the day  thereby hitting their respective 52 week highs of  239 05 and  123 02 
Other notable gainers from railroads include   Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    up 4 4   and Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC    up 1 7     and from airlines   Southwest Airlines   NYSE LUV    up 3 5    JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU    up 3 1   and Alaska Air Group   NYSE ALK    up 2 1   
All the above mentioned stocks with the exception of FedEx and Alaska Air Group carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
Tax Bill
With the Senate clearing its version of the tax reform bill  President Donald Trump has secured his first major legislative win after more than 10 months in office  We note that the House had passed its version of the tax bill in mid November  The  1 5 trillion tax overhaul package is expected to be enacted into law by year end  following resolution of the differences in the two versions 
As various market watchers seem to debate over the pros and cons of the tax reform bill  we expect transportation stocks in the United States to be a major beneficiary  The optimism was reflected by the buoyant performance of the sector participants in the stock market on Dec 4 
Both versions propose to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35  to 20   On materialization  this huge reduction will naturally benefit transportation stocks in the United States  Most sector participants book a significant part of their revenues  domestically  Therefore  the 15 point cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow  which in turn will aid their bottom lines 
The proposal aims to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate than they otherwise would ve shelled out  Currently  if foreign income is repatriated  it is taxed at 35  with a full credit of the local levies 
Capital Expenditures
Transportation stocks   mainly railroads and airlines   invest significantly for capital expenditure as the industry is capital intensive in nature  For example  Union Pacific has announced a  3 1 billion capital plan this year  which is in line with its efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity 
In the current scenario  capital expenditures cannot be tax deducted in the year they are incurred  Consequently  U S  companies need to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure  However  companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income immediately  as per the provisions of the tax reform bill  Naturally  this aspect of the bill hugely favors transports and if it materializes companies in the space would be huge gainers 
In the event of companies being able to deduct capital expenses in the year of their occurrence  their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions  This will leave more cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases among others 
Picture for Airlines
Apart from railroads and package delivery companies  stocks belonging to the airline space also are expected to be huge benefactors from the U S  tax overhaul  The capital intensive nature of the industry implies that the above mentioned benefits pertaining to capital expenses should aid carriers as well 
Since most airline companies are almost entirely exposed to the statutory corporate tax rate  the massive tax cut is expected to help them save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States 
In fact  most market watchers believe that the tax cut would benefit low cost carriers like Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways more than the legacy carriers  This is because the likes of Delta had emerged from bankruptcy a few years ago  Consequently  their current incomes are still being offset by prior losses  Naturally  they do not stand to be benefitted immediately  tangibly  by the tax cuts  However  their smaller rivals like JetBlue are immediate gainers from the tax cuts as they were paying higher taxes till now 
Price Performance
Following the recovery from the negative effects of the back to back natural calamities stocks in transportation space have been performing well recently  Additionally  an  improving economy  a much improved job market and rising disposable income have been a blessing for the sector participants  Also  consumer confidence remains strong resulting in more Americans going on vacations 
The fact that things are looking up for transports can be gauged from the fact that the  has outperformed the S P 500 Index over the last month  While the industry rallied 4 4   the S P 500 Index has gained 2  in the same period 

 
With the corporate tax cut likely to become a reality  transports are expected to gain further in the coming days  Naturally  investors will keenly wait for further updates on this burning issue

155208,376724,UNP,Coal  Intermodal Lead Railroads  Resurgence,opinion,"Railroads are riding high in 2017 after years of struggle  primarily due to declining coal shipments  The improving fortunes of railroad operators are well reflected by the 29 3  improvement in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index on a year to date basis 
Railroads Aided by Coal Revival
Behind this revival is primarily the improving scenario pertaining to coal  In fact  President Trump s pro coal stance is a huge positive for railroads  given their significant dependence on the commodity for revenue generation  We note that coal had lost significance as a source of fuel during former President Obama s tenure   
Now  President Trump s plans to shift focus to traditional energy businesses such as coal is expected to aid railroads  whose fortunes are tied to a great extent to coal  Moreover  in March 2017  Trump signed an order to repeal the Clean Power Plan  More recently  Trump walked out from the Paris climate agreement 
The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the third quarter of 2017  For example  at Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC  coal revenues  freight  increased 13 1   while the same at CSX Corp   CSX  rose 10  year over year owing to 5  expansion in volumes  At Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   revenues improved 19  at the energy segment on the back of impressive performances at the Utility Coal  Frac Sand and Crude Oil units 
All the above mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   
Intermodal Volumes Also Showing Strength
Apart from coal  the intermodal unit is also seeing good times this year after a lackluster 2016  According to the Intermodal Association of North America  IANA   intermodal volumes improved 2  year over year in the first quarter of 2017 
The scenario improved further with intermodal volumes rising 4 5  in the second quarter and 6 3  in the third quarter  on a year over year basis  This was the highest growth rate recorded in more than three years  Volumes on the international as well as domestic fronts touched record highs during the quarter  The positive readings certainly support the buoyant picture surrounding railroads 
With the key segments performing well  it was of little wonder that overall volumes improved in the third quarter at railroads  helping them to register impressive results despite the disruption in operations due to the recent hurricanes 
Operating Ratio Improvement Highlights Effective Management
A key metric to gauge the performance of railroads is operating ratio  defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues   The lower the value of operating ratio the better  as it implies that more cash is available to reward shareholders through dividends buybacks  A lower value of operating ratio is  in fact  a pat on the back for management of a railroad operator  Adding to the buoyancy in railroads  most operators registered an improvement in this key metric in the third quarter of 2017 
For example  Kansas City Southern s operating ratio came in at 64 4  compared with 66 9  reported a year ago  At Norfolk Southern  this key metric improved to 65 9  from 67 5  in the third quarter of 2016 
Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65  by 2020 or even earlier  At CSX  operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 68 1  in the third quarter  In 2017  CSX expects operating ratio in the high end of mid 60s  The metric also improved at Genesee   Wyoming  GWR  
Additionally  prudent cost management of railroad operators raise optimism in the stocks  To this end  Union Pacific Corp   UNP  announced its decision to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees in August 2017  in a bid to increase efficiencies 
Investor Friendly Actions Attest to Financial Health
Most railroad operators are in sound financial health as evident by their shareholder friendly activities  dividends and buybacks   In line with its investor friendly attitude  Union Pacific bought back 11 8 million shares for  1 3 billion in the third quarter of 2017  During the first nine months of 2017  the company returned around  4 4 billion to its stockholders through dividends buybacks 
Additionally  Norfolk Southern s board of directors approved a new share buyback program in October 2017  The company is now authorized to buy back an additional 50 million shares through Dec 31  2022 
Moreover  many railroad operators including the likes of Kansas City Southern  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CP  and Canadian National Railway  CNI  have hiked their dividend payouts this year  in a show of financial prosperity  Additionally  the robust financial health of most railroads has prompted them to invest substantially to promote safety and enhance productivity 
To Wrap Up
Apart from the above mentioned tailwinds  an improving domestic economy bodes well for railroads  We believe that in light of factors like better coal and intermodal volumes  Trump s pro coal stance and industrial growth investors should look at stocks in the space with renewed interest

155209,376725,UNP,Factors That Could Curb Revival Of The Railroad Industry,opinion,"Stocks in the railroad space are witnessing good times on the back of a number of tailwinds like an improved coal and intermodal scenario  financial prosperity and prudent cost management  among others  Despite the air of optimism  there are certain roadblocks one must be mindful of before investing in the sector  Let s delve into the details 
Declining Automotive Volumes
Weakness in the automotive sector  due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States  has been hurting railroads for quite some time and the third quarter of 2017 was no exception  Results of major railroad operators like Union Pacific Corp   UNP  and Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC  were distorted due to softness in this key sector 
Automotive volumes declined 10  and 5  at Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific  respectively  in the third quarter of 2017  What is worse is that the situation on this front is unlikely to improve dramatically in the fourth quarter Union Pacific on its third quarter conference call said that light vehicle sales for full year 2017 are projected at 17 million units  reflecting a 3  decline from the 2016 levels  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes in the fourth quarter will hurt them significantly 
Weather Related Disruptions
The recent hurricanes hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines  Freight costs skyrocketed following the natural disasters  With fuel costs on the rise  the bottom line of these companies were hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes 
For instance  at Union Pacific  operating expenses increased 6  year over year to  3 4 billion in the third quarter  primarily due to Harvey  Furthermore  third quarter operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  deteriorated 70 basis points to 62 8  at Union Pacific  Operating ratio also deteriorated at the likes of Canadian National Railway  CNI  in the third quarter due to high fuel costs 
Though operations have been normalized to a large extent  re occurrence of such violent acts of nature have the potential to hurt the bottom lines of railroads significantly by increasing costs  In fact  such acts of nature throw railroad schedules out of gear by rendering multiple miles of track out of service 
NAFTA Uncertainty
Uncertainty surrounding the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  is a major overhang on railroads  NAFTA refers to the trade pact inked in 1994 between the United States  Canada and Mexico in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers  NAFTA has basically done away with almost all tariff among the three nations 
However  President Trump has repeatedly stated that he does not find the deal favorable to the United States  The President has called it     Trump has in fact threatened to   if the negotiations  which are currently in progress  fail to yield the desired results  Consequently  any unfavorable development on NAFTA has the potential to hit railroads like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU  that have significant exposure to Mexico Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
Other Headwinds
Service disruptions at CSX Corp   CSX   earlier in the year  battered the company  In fact  it had to attend a hearing of the U S  Surface Transportation Board in October  due to service issues   
Company CEO Hunter Harrison  while apologizing to customers  attributed the disruptions to some of its employees resisting his attempts to boost earnings at CSX through cost cutting efforts  The company has already laid off more than 2 000 employees so far this year  The workforce at CSX is expected to be trimmed further by year end 
Naturally  Harrison s efforts at streamlining operations have met with resistance from employees  Though the company stated on the third quarter conference call that the issues are a thing a past  the occurrence of such customer related problems are unwelcome and should be avoided   
Moreover  repealing the Clean Power Plan  CPP   aimed at benefiting the coal industry and therefore railroads  is a time consuming affair  Furthermore  even if CPP is repealed  as envisaged by President Trump  demand for coal might not pick up due to factors like cheap natural gas  according to many market watchers  In the event of the scenario materializing  railroads won t be benefited much  if at all  even if CPP is done away with 
Furthermore  proposals concerning reciprocal switching  referred to as forced access by the Association of American Railroads  if implemented  could result in significant loss of revenues for railroads  This is because the proposal pertaining to reciprocal switching would require railroads t0 share rail traffic with their competitors  most likely at below market rates 
Conclusion
The write up clearly indicates that stocks in the railroad space are not free from headwinds in spite of the optimism surrounding the space  The problems  unless solved quickly  can result in investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from the sector

155245,376761,UNP,Volume Growth Drives Railroads In Q3  What Lies Ahead ,opinion,"The Q3 earnings season saw upbeat bottom line performances by most railroad operators despite the recent hurricanes  Harvey  Irma and Maria   In fact  railroads seem to be recovering this year after a prolonged struggle due to coal related issues 
The string of encouraging releases in Q3  on the top  and bottom lines  from key segmental players like Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC    Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   reflects the improved scenario regarding railroads 
All the above mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see 
Factors Driving the Turnaround 
Stocks in the railroad space have performed well so far this year on the back of multiple tailwinds  In fact  the improvement in the coal industry has immensely benefited stocks in the space as coal is a key revenue generator 
The commodity is likely to see even better days given President Trump s pro coal stance  Apart from coal  other key divisions of railroads like intermodal are also performing well  The strong performance of key sectors at railroads is leading to an uptick in overall volumes 
Another factor working in favor of railroads is the improvement in the U S  economy  In the third quarter of 2017  intermodal volumes increased  on a year over year basis  This was the highest growth rate recorded in more than three years 
A buoyant domestic economy has also contributed to the turnaround at railroads  A vibrant economy implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail 
In fact  the likes of Kansas City Southern  CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX    Canadian National Railway Co    NYSE CNI   and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CP   have hiked their quarterly dividend payouts this year  which further highlights the financial prosperity of the sector participants 
Operating Ratio Improvement   A Positive Catalyst
In the third quarter  Kansas City Southern s operating ratio  defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  came in at 64 4  compared with 66 9  reported a year ago  At Norfolk Southern  this key metric improved to 65 9  from 67 5  in the third quarter of 2016 
Norfolk Southern aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65  by 2020 or even earlier  At CSX  operating ratio operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 68 1  in the third quarter  In 2017  CSX expects operating ratio in the high end of mid 60s  The metric also improved at Genesee   Wyoming   NYSE GWR    Additionally  the prudent cost management of railroad operators raise optimism in the stocks 
Solid Price Performance
Driven by the above mentioned tailwinds  the  has outperformed the broader market so far this year  While the S P 500 Index gained 15 7   the industry rallied 19 2  

Also  a 19 3  improvement in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index on a year to date basis  bears testimony to bullishness surrounding railroads 
Zacks Industry Rank Supports Favorable Scenario
The Zacks Industry Rank of 118  out of 250 plus groups  carried by the Zacks Rail industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads  The favorable rank places the companies in the top 46  of the Zacks industries 
We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

What to Expect in Q4 
We expect railroads to continue performing well in the fourth quarter of 2017  driven by volume growth as was the case in Q3  Key units such as intermodal and coal are also expected to aid in delivering encouraging results  
The cost discipline of railroads might also drive the bottom line  For example  CSX expects its bottom line to expand between 20  and 25  in 2017  on a reported basis  over 2016 levels  driven by improved efficiencies 
Currently  the valuation picture for railroads is favorable and certainly points at some degree of upside  When valued according to the forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the current financial year  F1   the Zacks Rail Transportation industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 19 8x P E multiple  In fact  the reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple  trading lower than its high end of 20 1x  in the last 12 months as well as the S P 500  20 5x   The industry s lower than market positioning calls for more upside 
Despite the positives  there are a few factors which might hurt results in the fourth quarter  Evidently  weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the third quarter  consequently production declined in the Unites States   
The scenario is expected to remain gloomy in the final quarter of 2017 as well  In fact  sales of U S  light vehicle sales for 2017 are projected at 17 million units  down approximately 3  on a year over year basis  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes might hurt railroads

155259,376775,UNP,Will Railroads Shine Brightly Despite Headwinds In Q3 ,opinion,It is a well documented fact that railroads have performed well so far in 2017  driven by multiple tailwinds  In fact  the revival in the coal related scenario has aided stocks in this space immensely  This is because coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroads  Notably  coal accounts for more than 15  of revenues for railroads in the United States  Also  President Trump s support for fossil fuels compared with the renewable energy is an added positive for the commodity In addition  a thriving and improving economy proves to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail  Given the importance of this commodity for railroads  any positive coal related development is expected to bode well for the sector  Markedly  the revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017  For example  at Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP   coal revenues  freight  increased 25   while the same at CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   and Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC   improved 27  and 32   respectively  The improvement in intermodal volumes is also a positive for railroads  Moreover  Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU    which is a key player in the same space  raised its quarterly dividend to 36 cents per share  annualized  1 44 per share  representing an increase of 9 1  over the previous payout  The likes of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CP   and Canadian National Railway   NYSE CNI   have raised their quarterly dividend payout this year as well  thus highlighting the financial prosperity of railroads Roadblocks to Watch Out for in Q3Given this backdrop  the scenario looks bright for railroads in the third quarter of 2017  Despite the positives  the recent disruptions particularly those caused by Harvey might limit growth  In this regard  Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share Furthermore  sluggishness pertaining to automotive volumes is an added concern for railroads in the to be reported quarter  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes are likely to hurt railroads significantly What s in Store in Q3 Despite the above mentioned headwinds  we expect railroads to perform impressively in the third quarter on the bottom line front  To counter the top line woes  many railroads are looking to cut costs to drive their respective bottom lines  To this end  Union Pacific announced its decision to trim its workforce by up to 750 employees in August 2017  in a bid to increase efficiencies Also  Norfolk Southern is looking to cut costs in order to drive its bottom line  The company anticipates improving coal volumes to boost its third quarter results  While it is impossible to be sure about the exact nature of performance by railroads in the to be reported quarter  we expect stocks in this sector to perform impressively driven by the above mentioned tailwinds despite the prevailing challenges  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks Research It s not the one you think ,2017-09-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-railroads-shine-brightly-despite-headwinds-in-q3-200215527,200215527
155269,376785,UNP,Here s What You Can Expect From Big Railroads In Q3 Earnings,opinion,"Things have looked up for the railroad space so far this year  after not so favorable past few years  particularly 2015 and 2016  owing to weakness in domestic coal shipments  The improvement in the coal scenario has turned out to be a huge blessing for railroads as it is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants The election of Donald Trump as the President of United States last year also worked wonders for the coal industry   The President is in favor of reviving the industry by relaxing regulations detrimental to its prospects  He has started to act on his promises made during the campaigning phase  For example  he has taken measures to repeal the Climate Power Plan The rise in natural gas prices is also helping to revive the demand for coal  Moreover  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   coal production in the United States will improve in 2017 and 2018  Given the importance of coal to railroads  any positive development for the commodity implies good news for the sector  Improvement in the freight scenario is also a positive for railroads The revival of coal is evident  from the impressive performances of key sector participants like Union Pacific Corporation   NYSE UNP    CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   and Norfolk Southern Corporation   NYSE NSC   that registered double digit growth with respect to coal revenues in the second quarter of 2017  In addition  an improving economy has also proved to be a boon for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States via rail The shareholder friendly activities of the likes of Norfolk Southern and Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI   in 2017 also highlight the financial prosperity of the sector participants Rail Traffic Data Highlights ImprovementThe latest U S  rail traffic report  for the week ended Sep 30  2017  of the Association of American Railroads   AAR   reveals 1 9  year over year growth in rail traffic  sum of total carloads and intermodal units   While total carloads for the week declined 1 6   intermodal volume increased 5 5  year over year  The favorable intermodal scenario is also a positive development for railroads The year to date data unveiled by AAR is also encouraging with a 3 8  improvement in total carloads  The favorable coal scenario is underscored by the fact that coal volumes have registered double digit  12 3   percentage gains so far this year  Overall rail traffic is up 3 6  year to date  with intermodal traffic rising 3 5  Headwinds That May Mar Q3 Earnings PictureIn view of the coal related improvement  the bullish scenario related to the intermodal unit and the thriving domestic economy  results of companies in the railroads space are expected to impress in the third quarter of 2017  However  there are a few factors  which might dampen their third quarter performance The back to back hurricanes  Harvey and Irma  have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines  Freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters  With fuel costs on the rise  the bottom line of these companies are likely to be hurt in the third quarter due to higher costs as a result of the hurricanes Union Pacific expects Harvey to hurt its bottom line to the tune of approximately 5 cents per share in the third quarter The sluggishness of the automotive unit is also a cause of worry for railroads   With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes is also likely to hurt railroads in the third quarter   What Awaits These 6 Railroads in Q3 Given this backdrop  let s take a look at how key railroad operators might fare in the third quarter of 2017  According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU    based in Kansas City  MO  is unlikely to report better than expected earnings per share in the third quarter despite its Zacks Rank  3  Hold   This is because it has an Earnings ESP of  1 18  as the Most Accurate estimate of  1 33 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Its results are likely to be hurt by Harvey  In a filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  last month  Kansas City Southern provided a detailed account of its operations being hurt by Harvey  Its results are scheduled to be announced on Oct 20 Kansas City Southern Price and EPS Surprise

Kansas City Southern  NYSE   NYSE KSU      and Genesee   Wyoming Inc   NYSE   NYSE GWR      Industry  Railroads  part 2Link  Stocks in the railroad space are psyched up after years of struggle  The main reason for the struggles of the sector was weakness in domestic coal shipments  However  things are looking up now for this a key revenue generating commodity for railroad operators  Coal Prospects Brighten in the Trump EraIt is a well documented fact that coal as a fuel source lost much of its relevance during President Obama s tenure  However  the election of President Trump late last year has been a blessing for this industry  which is a vital source of employment in the country  The President is in favor of increasing employment in this industry apart from relaxing regulations  As coal accounts for more than 15  of revenues for railroads in the U S   it is natural that any bullish development pertaining to the commodity is a boon for railroads Trump s repeated emphasis on the need to revive the coal industry bodes well for the railroad industry  He is a bigger fan of fossil fuels compared to renewable energy  and has started to act on his pre election promises and taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan  Trump also walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement  Both have similar objectives of lowering emission levels Given this backdrop  we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime  Naturally  sector participants like Union Pacific Corp   NYSE       Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE      and CSX Corp   NASDAQ      stand to benefit substantially if the President successfully resurrects the coal industry Union Pacific carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  An improving economy also means good news for railroads as it implies that an increased volume of goods are crossing the country on the rails  Additionally  coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production  The bullishness surrounding railroad operators is clear from the 10 61  year to date increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index Impressive Q2In view of the positive sentiment surrounding the space and the improvement of coal volumes  it is of little surprise that railroads fared well in the Q2 earnings season  The railroad space saw major players like Norfolk Southern  Kansas City Southern  NYSE       Union Pacific  Genesee   Wyoming Inc   NYSE      and CSX report earnings beats Apart from reporting better than expected earnings  companies like Kansas City  Union Pacific and CSX also outperformed on the revenue front  The vast improvement in coal revenues led to the turnaround in fortunes of the sector participants For example  at Union Pacific  coal revenues  freight  increased 25  while the same at CSX improved 27   The intermodal unit has also performed well in the quarter Union Pacific s expectation that its business volumes will improve further in the second half of the year raises further optimism Operating Ratio Improvement  A Key PositiveIn the second quarter  Union Pacific s operating ratio  defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  came in at 61 8   reflecting an improvement of 340 basis points on a year over year basis  The metric benefited from higher fuel prices The company is on track to achieve its guidance of around 60  by 2019  Operating ratio of 55  is targeted beyond 2019  We are also impressed by the  3 1 billion capital plan announced by the company in 2017  The plan is in line with the company s efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  Operating ratio in the mid 60s is expected this year at CSX Norfolk Southern is on track to deliver annual savings to the tune of  650 million by 2020  Operating ratio of below 65  is targeted by 2020 or even earlier  CEO James A  Squires recently said that the company is on track to achieve these targets  The efforts of railroad operators to cut costs in order to

155294,376810,UNP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Union Pacific  CSX And Norfolk Southern,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  August 14  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Railroads  Part 3  including Union Pacific Corp   NYSE   NYSE UNP       CSX Corp   NASDAQ   NASDAQ CSX      and Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE   NYSE NSC      Industry  Railroads  part 3Link  It is a well established fact that coal related headwinds battered stocks in the railroad space over the past few years  however things are looking up now on that front thanks to President Trump s favorable views on the commodity  An improving economy also means good news for railroads  Despite this optimism  one must be mindful of certain factors still hurting stocks in the space before investing in the sector  Let s delve into the details Sluggish Automotive Production  Major HeadwindWeakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the second quarter  with production in the U S  declining substantially  However  the major worry is that the scenario is expected to worsen ahead  thereby hurting railroads big time  In fact  sector participants like Union Pacific Corp   NYSE       CSX Corp   NASDAQ      and Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE      have issued disappointing views for the back half of the year Union Pacific on its second quarter conference call said that light vehicle production in North America for the third quarter is projected to decline approximately 6   Moreover  light vehicle sales for full year 2017 are projected at 17 1 million units  reflecting a 2  decline from 2016 levels  Norfolk Southern  meanwhile  said that automotive production  which declined 6 5  year over year in the U S  in the second quarter  is projected to be worse with a 9 3  decline in the third quarter The disappointing commentaries above imply a bleak outlook for railroads pertaining to automotive volumes in the remaining quarters of the year  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes will hurt railroads big time Reciprocal Switching   What Lies Ahead The regulations concerning reciprocal switching proposed by the Department of Transportation s Surface Transportation Board  STB  could hurt railroads big time  if implemented  The proposal   also referred to as forced access by the Association of American Railroads  AAR    implies that shippers without access to other transportation modes will be permitted to use a competing rail line without any additional pricing and possibly at below market rates AAR is against the implementation of the proposal as it might lead to the top line of railroads shrinking significantly  Moreover  increased costs are likely to hurt the bottom line  In Jul 2017  AAR s President and Chief Executive Officer Edward Hamberger  urged STB not to implement proposals pertaining to forced switching among others  Consequently  investors interested in the railroad would keenly wait for updates on this burning issue Other HeadwindsOne of President Trump s efforts to revive the coal industry is to do away with the Clean Power Plan  CPP   which is a favorable development for railroads  However  the task is easier said than done  with many hurdles along the way  Moreover  Norfolk Southern s commentary on coal for the latter half of the year is also troubling  According to the company  though the coal scenario is projected to improve further in the second half of 2017  the pace will be sluggish primarily due to a slowdown in export of the commodity  The company said that export tonnage is likely to be lower than the levels witnessed in the first half of the year  It is projected to come down to the range of 4 million to 5 million ton per quarter Moreover  the Trump administration is making efforts to  the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    the trade pact inked in 1994 between the U S   Canada and Mexico   in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers  We note that railroads like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  have significant exposure to Mexico  In this scenario  any unfavorable development on NAFTA has the potential to hit these companies hard Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  ConclusionThe above write up clearly indicates that railroads are not bereft of headwinds despite the optimism surrounding the space  The challenges can result in investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from the sector Check out our

    Keeping these positives in view  we believe the investors should hold on to Union Pacific stock for now Zacks Rank   Key PicksUnion Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the transportation sector are Canadian National Railway Company   NYSE CNI    Alstom  PA ALSO  SA   OTC ALSMY   and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited   NYSE CP    While Canadian National Railway sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Alstom and Canadian Pacific Railway carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   Shares of Canadian National Railway and Alstom have rallied over 6  in the last three months  while Canadian Pacific Railway shares have gained more than 8  on a year to date basis The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2017-08-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-should-you-retain-union-pacific-unp-stock-for-now-200207545,200207545
155299,376815,UNP,3 Railroads To Buy On Coal Comeback   Other Catalysts,opinion,"Stocks in the railroad space have performed impressively so far this year buoyed by the improvement in the coal related scenario  Since coal is a key revenue generating commodity for stocks in this space  any positive coal related update is bound to lift their spirits 
In fact  improvement on the coal front is highly significant for railroads as stocks in the space had struggled over the last few years due to dwindling coal shipments  The bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 11 3  increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index  year to date 
Coal Revival   The Primary Catalyst Behind the Surge
The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017  For example  at Union Pacific Corporation   NYSE UNP   coal revenues  freight  increased 25  while the same at CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   and Norfolk Southern Corporation   NYSE NSC   improved 27  and 32   respectively 
Currently  all these three stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
In fact  the election of President Trump last year has been a boon for this industry  Notably  Trump s pro coal stance is a huge positive for the commodity which lost much of its relevance during President Obama s tenure as a source of fuel 
Trump has been advocating the case for fossil fuels instead of renewable energy  and has raised questions regarding climate change and its expected widespread impact  Already  he has started to act on his pre election promises and has also taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan  He walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement as well 
A thriving and improving economy also supports the bullish case for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States on the rails  This improvement under the new regime is evident from the fact that the Zacks  outperformed the broader market so far this year  While the S P 500 Index gained 11   the industry added 12 8  

Based on this healthy picture  we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime  Additionally  coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production 
Intermodal Shows Promise
Apart from the bullish coal related scenario and industrial growth  improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are also expected to boost stocks in the railroad space  In fact  things  have turned around for the better in the current year  which is a positive for the sector as intermodal continues to generate significant revenues for major U S  railroad companies 
According to the Intermodal Association of North America  intermodal volumes improved 2  year over year in the first quarter of 2017  The scenario improved further in the second quarter with the measure rising   In fact  this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years 
Financial Strength
We note that the strong balance sheets of major railroads have enabled them to engage in shareholder friendly activities  In keeping with this trend  Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   recently announced a 9 1  hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 36 cents per share  Moreover  the company announced fresh buyback plans 
Additionally  the likes of Canadian National Railway   NYSE CNI    Canadian Pacific Railway   NYSE CP   and CSX Corp  have hiked their respective dividend payouts this year  In another shareholder friendly move  Norfolk Southern recently increased its full year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from  800 million to  1 billion 
In fact  the significant investments made by railroads to promote safety also raise optimism and indicate toward their financial well being 
Going forward  railroads are also looking to drive bottom line growth through various cost cutting measures  To improve efficiencies  Union Pacific recently announced that it intends to  by up to 750 employees 
Zacks Industry Rank Supports Bullish Scenario
The Zacks Industry Rank of 17  out of 250 plus groups  carried by the Zacks  further highlights the attractiveness of railroads as an investing option on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above  Markedly  the favorable rank places the companies in the top 7  of the Zacks industries 
We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

A sector that boasts well paying stocks in terms of dividends  is the one having railroad stocks  Notably  railroads are witnessing good times currently after having struggled in the past few years  The most important catalyst behind the upsurge is the revival pertaining to coal  which is a key revenue generating commodity for the sector participants 
The revival of coal can be made out from the impressive performances of most sector participants with respect to the commodity in the second quarter of 2017  For example  at Union Pacific Corporation   NYSE UNP   coal revenues  freight  increased 25   while the same at CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX   and Norfolk Southern Corporation   NYSE NSC   improved 27  and 32   respectively 
Meanwhile  the bullishness surrounding the railroad operators is evident from a 12 3  increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index  year to date  Furthermore  Trump s pro coal stance is also a boon for the sector 
Rebound in Intermodal Volumes   Another Positive 
Apart from the improvement on the coal front  intermodal volumes have also improved this year after a disappointing 2016  According to the Intermodal Association of North America  IANA   intermodal volumes improved 2  year over year in the first quarter of 2017 
The scenario improved further in the second quarter with intermodal volumes rising   In fact  this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years  The positive readings certainly support the air of optimism surrounding railroads 
Solid Price Performance
The improved scenario regarding railroads can be out from the fact that  outperformed the broader market so far this year  While the S P 500 Index gained 11 7   the industry added 14

Trump has been advocating the case of fossil fuels instead of renewable energy and has raised questions regarding climate change and its expected widespread impact  He has started to act on his pre election promises and taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan  Moreover  Trump walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement 
A thriving and improving economy also supports the bullish case for railroads as it implies that more goods are being transported across the U S  via rail 
Coal Improvement Drives Q2  Will the Bullish Scenario Continue 
True to the health of railroads  most sector participants performed impressively in the second quarter of 2017  Jacksonville  FL based CSX Corp   CSX  provided a solid start to the major railroads in the current reporting cycle 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company reported better than expected earnings per share and revenues in the second quarter  riding on the step up in coal  Coal revenues surged 27  year over year to  530 million due to a 7  expansion in volumes  You can see  
Another major railroad operator   Union Pacific Corp   UNP    based in Omaha  NE  also outperformed in the quarter on higher freight revenues  The uptick was owing to volume growth and increased fuel surcharge revenues  among other factors  Although growth was witnessed across all key segments  coal was again the star performer with freight revenues from the commodity increasing 25  on 17  growth in business volumes 
Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   based in Kansas City  MO  also reported better than expected revenues and earnings per share in the second quarter  Results were aided by a 6  rise in overall carload volumes  The energy segment impressed in the quarter  with utility coal boosting segmental results  Norfolk  VA based Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC  also saw a significant uptick in coal revenues during the quarter  Norfolk Southern expects coal revenues to continue improving in the third quarter as well 
In fact  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   has predicted that U S  coal consumption will increase from the projected 2017 levels of 729 3 million short tons  MMst  to 744 2 MMst in 2018  Any positive development on coal is good news for railroads not only because it is a key revenue generator but also because coal related headwinds were primarily responsible for the struggles of the sector participants over the last few quarters 
Rebound in Intermodal Volumes   Another Positive Catalyst
Apart from the improvement on the coal front  intermodal volumes also improved for key railroads  driving second quarter results  In fact after the disappointing 2016  which was witness to declining intermodal volumes  the scenario has turned around for the better this year 
According to the Intermodal Association of North America  IANA   intermodal volumes improved 2  year over year in the first quarter of 2017  The scenario improved further in the second quarter with the measure rising   In fact  this was the highest growth rate recorded in almost three years  The positive readings certainly support the air of optimism surrounding railroads 
Other Positives Driving the Industry
Railroads are investing substantially in enhancing safety  which is highly encouraging  For example  Union Pacific has announced a  3 1 billion capital plan for 2017  The plan is in line with the company s efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  Union Pacific s crossing accident rate improved to 2 27 in the first half of 2017 compared with 2 4 recorded in the first half of 2016 
Moreover  efforts of railroads to drive the bottom line through prudent cost management also raise optimism as far as this sector is concerned  For example  Norfolk Southern is on track to deliver annual productivity savings to the tune of  650 million by 2020   250 million reached in 2016 with an additional savings in excess  100 million projected this year   It also registered a record operating ratio  defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  of 66 3  in the second quarter of 2017  The metric improved 230 basis points from the year ago quarter  The company aims to achieve an operating ratio of below 65  by 2020 or even earlier 
Moreover  the dividend hikes announced by the likes of Canadian National Railway  CNI   Canadian Pacific Railway  CP  and CSX this year signal financial strength and prosperity for railroads  In another shareholder friendly move  Norfolk Southern recently increased its full year 2017 target pertaining to buybacks from  800 million to  1 billion 
Bullish Zacks Industry Rank
The Zacks Industry Rank of 9  out of 265 groups  carried by the Transportation Rail Industry further highlights the attractiveness of railroads as an investing option on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above  The favorable rank places the companies in the top 4  of the Zacks industries 
We put our X industries  all 265 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

Valuation Signals Upside
When valued according to the forward price to earnings  P E  ratio for the next financial year  F2   the Zacks Rail Transportation industry does not appear too expensive as it is trading at 16 41x P E multiple  The reading appears favorable when compared with its own traded multiple  trading lower than its high end of 17 56x and median of 16 84x  in the last 12 months as well as the S P 500  17 67x   The industry s lower than market positioning calls for more upside 
The story is not dissimilar when the industry is valued according to the EV EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  multiple  The industry currently has a forward 12 month  F12  EV EBITDA ratio of 10 25x  which is better than what the industry saw in the last year with the ratio near the low end of the one year range  and lower than the high end of 11 08x  The reading is also lower than that for the S P 500  10 40x  
Some Roadblocks to Beware
Despite the above mentioned tailwinds  there are some challenges that one needs to be mindful of before putting hard earned money into stocks in the space  The disappointing outlook issued by the likes of CSX and Norfolk Southern on their respective automotive units for the latter half of 2017 is concerning  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes will hurt railroads big time 
Moreover  regulations like revenue adequacy  forced switching and limit price tests have the potential to hurt railroads big time in the event of being implemented  Moreover  any unfavorable development on North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    the trade pact inked in 1994 between the U S   Canada  and Mexico   may hurt railroads like Kansas City Southern  KSU  significantly as they have significant Mexican exposure 
Bottom Line
The sector s attractive valuation  an improving economy  President Trump s pro coal stance  improvement in intermodal volumes and other positives make us believe that despite some headwinds  good times will continue for railroads over the next few months

155335,376851,UNP,Coal Revival  A Blessing For Railroads,opinion,"Stocks in the railroad space are psyched up after years of struggle  The main reason for the struggles of the sector was weakness in domestic coal shipments  However  things are looking up now for this a key revenue generating commodity for railroad operators  
Coal Prospects Brighten in the Trump Era
It is a well documented fact that coal as a fuel source lost much of its relevance during President Obama s tenure  However  the election of President Trump late last year has been a blessing for this industry  which is a vital source of employment in the country  The President is in favor of increasing employment in this industry apart from relaxing regulations  As coal accounts for more than 15  of revenues for railroads in the U S   it is natural that any bullish development pertaining to the commodity is a boon for railroads 
Trump s repeated emphasis on the need to revive the coal industry bodes well for the railroad industry  He is a bigger fan of fossil fuels compared to renewable energy  and has started to act on his pre election promises and taken measures to repeal the Clean Power Plan  Trump also walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement  Both have similar objectives of lowering emission levels 
Given this backdrop  we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime  Naturally  sector participants like Union Pacific Corp   UNP   Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC  and CSX Corp   CSX  stand to benefit substantially if the President successfully resurrects the coal industry 
Union Pacific carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
An improving economy also means good news for railroads as it implies that an increased volume of goods are crossing the country on the rails  Additionally  coal volumes will be positively impacted in the event of higher industrial production  The bullishness surrounding railroad operators is clear from the 10 61  year to date increase witnessed in the Dow Jones U S  Railroads Index 
Impressive Q2
In view of the positive sentiment surrounding the space and the improvement of coal volumes  it is of little surprise that railroads fared well in the Q2 earnings season  The railroad space saw major players like Norfolk Southern  Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   Union Pacific  Genesee   Wyoming Inc   GWR  and CSX report earnings beats 
Apart from reporting better than expected earnings  companies like Kansas City  Union Pacific and CSX also outperformed on the revenue front  The vast improvement in coal revenues led to the turnaround in fortunes of the sector participants 
For example  at Union Pacific  coal revenues  freight  increased 25  while the same at CSX improved 27   The intermodal unit has also performed well in the quarter 
Union Pacific s expectation that its business volumes will improve further in the second half of the year raises further optimism 
Operating Ratio Improvement  A Key Positive
In the second quarter  Union Pacific s operating ratio  defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  came in at 61 8   reflecting an improvement of 340 basis points on a year over year basis  The metric benefited from higher fuel prices 
The company is on track to achieve its guidance of around 60  by 2019  Operating ratio of 55  is targeted beyond 2019  We are also impressed by the  3 1 billion capital plan announced by the company in 2017  The plan is in line with the company s efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  Operating ratio in the mid 60s is expected this year at CSX 
Norfolk Southern is on track to deliver annual savings to the tune of  650 million by 2020  Operating ratio of below 65  is targeted by 2020 or even earlier  CEO James A  Squires recently said that the company is on track to achieve these targets  The efforts of railroad operators to cut costs in order to drive the bottom line raise optimism 
Dividend Hike Buybacks Bode Well
Investors are always on the lookout for companies that have a track of consistent and incremental dividend payments  Railroads score on this aspect  as well  In May 2017  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited  CP  raised its quarterly dividend per share by 12 5  to C 0 5625 per share  The board cleared a new share buyback program as well 
Also  during the second quarter  CSX s board authorized an additional  500 million for the current share repurchase program  now worth  1 5 billion   The company bought back stock worth nearly  500 million in the reported quarter under the program  The likes of Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CNI  also hiked their respective dividend payouts earlier in the year 
Additionally  the decision of major railroads to make significant investments to boost safety and productivity raises optimism  Union Pacific has announced a capital plan worth  3 1 billion for 2017  The plan is in line with the company s efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity  Union Pacific s crossing accident rate improved to 2 27 in the first half of 2017 from 2 4 in the first half of 2016 
Moreover  the inauguration of the expanded 102 year old Panama Canal last year augurs well for eastern railroads  This is because of an expected increase in container traffic 
Bottom Line
In view of the above tailwinds  led by the improving coal related scenario  it can be stated that railroads should continue to see brighter days ahead  Consequently  we believe that investors should look at this sector with renewed interest

155336,376852,UNP,Will Sluggish Automotive Production Derail Railroads ,opinion,"It is a well established fact that coal related headwinds battered stocks in the railroad space over the past few years  however things are looking up now on that front thanks to President Trump s favorable views on the commodity  An improving economy also means good news for railroads  Despite this optimism  one must be mindful of certain factors still hurting stocks in the space before investing in the sector  Let s delve into the details 
Sluggish Automotive Production  Major Headwind
Weakness in the automotive sector had hurt the results of major railroads in the second quarter  with production in the U S  declining substantially  However  the major worry is that the scenario is expected to worsen ahead  thereby hurting railroads big time  In fact  sector participants like Union Pacific Corp   UNP   CSX Corp   CSX  and Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC  have issued disappointing views for the back half of the year 
Union Pacific on its second quarter conference call said that light vehicle production in North America for the third quarter is projected to decline approximately 6   Moreover  light vehicle sales for full year 2017 are projected at 17 1 million units  reflecting a 2  decline from 2016 levels  Norfolk Southern  meanwhile  said that automotive production  which declined 6 5  year over year in the U S  in the second quarter  is projected to be worse with a 9 3  decline in the third quarter 
The disappointing commentaries above imply a bleak outlook for railroads pertaining to automotive volumes in the remaining quarters of the year  With the automotive sector accounting for a significant chunk of their revenues  softness in automotive volumes will hurt railroads big time 
Reciprocal Switching   What Lies Ahead 
The regulations concerning reciprocal switching proposed by the Department of Transportation s Surface Transportation Board  STB  could hurt railroads big time  if implemented  The proposal   also referred to as forced access by the Association of American Railroads  AAR    implies that shippers without access to other transportation modes will be permitted to use a competing rail line without any additional pricing and possibly at below market rates 
AAR is against the implementation of the proposal as it might lead to the top line of railroads shrinking significantly  Moreover  increased costs are likely to hurt the bottom line  In Jul 2017  AAR s President and Chief Executive Officer Edward Hamberger  urged STB not to implement proposals pertaining to forced switching among others  Consequently  investors interested in the railroad would keenly wait for updates on this burning issue 
Other Headwinds
One of President Trump s efforts to revive the coal industry is to do away with the Clean Power Plan  CPP   which is a favorable development for railroads  However  the task is easier said than done  with many hurdles along the way  Moreover  Norfolk Southern s commentary on coal for the latter half of the year is also troubling  According to the company  though the coal scenario is projected to improve further in the second half of 2017  the pace will be sluggish primarily due to a slowdown in export of the commodity  The company said that export tonnage is likely to be lower than the levels witnessed in the first half of the year  It is projected to come down to the range of 4 million to 5 million ton per quarter 
Moreover  the Trump administration is making efforts to  the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    the trade pact inked in 1994 between the U S   Canada and Mexico   in a bid to secure better terms for domestic workers  We note that railroads like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  have significant exposure to Mexico  In this scenario  any unfavorable development on NAFTA has the potential to hit these companies hard 
Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Conclusion
The above write up clearly indicates that railroads are not bereft of headwinds despite the optimism surrounding the space  The challenges can result in investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from the sector

	Chicago  IL   April 19  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Railroads  Part 1  including CSX Corp   NASDAQ         Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   NYSE         Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NYSE         Union Pacific Corp   NYSE        and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   NYSE        

	Industry  Railroads  Part 1

	Link  

	With Q1 earnings season upon us  companies like Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rated CSX Corp   NASDAQ       and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   NYSE        are kick starting the earnings season for the Railroads sector tomorrow  Apr 19  With stocks in the space having struggled over the past few quarters  mainly due to coal related headwinds  we wait to see if the sector displays an improved performance this time around  You can see   

	Nevertheless  the positive sentiment surrounding the space mainly due to the favorable scenario regarding coal volumes in 2017 raises optimism  Given that coal is a key revenue generator for railroad operators  the commodity is the primary determinant of the fate of the sector participants  Impressive industrial volume growth should boost results in the coming periods as well 

Will Railroads Gain from Trump s Victory 

	Key railroads like Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE         CSX Corp  and Union Pacific Corp   NYSE        have seen a surge in their stock prices following the election of President Trump  Trump s pro coal stance and promises to revive the coal industry were big contributors to the upside as is the expectation of an overall pro growth fiscal and regulatory policy regime 

	The new administration s pro coal policy stance is expected to help the commodity s demand  Trump s skepticism of climate change issues and focus on reviving the country s manufacturing base is a potentially long term positive for fossil fuel based electricity generation  Trump s recent executive action rolling back the preceding administration s environmental stipulations about carbon emissions are a practical manifestation of this policy stance  Other plans include doing away with the ban on coal leasing on federal lands  scrapping regulations to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production  and reconsidering the  social cost  of carbon emissions in all regulatory actions 

	Coal fired plants are likely to gain the most from these actions  With coal accounting for over 15  of the revenues for Class I railroads in the U S   any favorable development pertaining to the commodity is a positive for these companies 

Other Positives

	We are positive on the efforts of railroads like Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific to cut costs in order to boost their bottom line  Norfolk Southern is on track to generate annual savings to the tune of  650 million by 2020  The company s operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  improved 510 basis points to 69 4  in the fourth quarter of 2016  Operating ratio of below 65  is targeted by 2020  The efforts of key railroads to reward shareholders through share repurchases and dividends also impress  In fact  railroads like Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CNI  have recently hiked their quarterly dividend payouts 

	We believe that the raised dividends highlight the commitment of these companies to create value for shareholders as well as underscore their strong financial condition and bright prospects  Additionally  the decision of major railroads to make significant investments to boost safety and productivity raises optimism 

Valuation Picture

	The Zacks Rail Transportation industry is up  8 9  in the year to date period  outperforming the  4 9  gain for the S P 500 index in the same time period  The industry is up  27 4  over the past year vs   11 4  for the index as a whole 

	As a result of this strong performance  the industry s valuation is no longer cheap  The Zacks Rail Transportation industry is currently at 18 3X the consensus forward 12 month EPS estimates  which is towards the high end of the 5 year trading range of 12 8X to 18 7X  The 5 year median forward 12 month PE multiple is 15 6X  The industry was trading at a discount to the S P 500 index based on this multiple since February 2015  and has shifted to a premium since the start of the year 

Headwinds

	While there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about railroads  the space is not entirely bereft of headwinds  Although Trump inked an executive order to repeal the Clean Power Plan  many market watchers believe that it will not be easy for the new administration to eliminate the plan  Not only will the process be extremely time consuming  but will also necessitate the formulation new rules 

	Moreover  the revival of coal may not be as expected  According to a Forbes     the share of coal in total electricity generation is projected to decline to 26  in 2040 from 33  in 2015  even if the Clean Power Plan is scrapped 

	Last month  Trump proposed a 13  reduction in federal funding for transports in the 2018 budget  Per the proposal  spending for this sector will be reduced by  2 4 billion from  18 4 billion outlined in the 2017 budget  One of the important features of the proposal is to stop federal funding for long distance Amtrak trains  Although it remains to be seen up to what extent railroads will be hurt by the spending cut  many market watchers believe that the Chicago area would be the worst hit if the proposals are accepted  This might hurt railroads like Union Pacific  We note that Union Pacific currently serves five facilities in the Chicago area 

	Moreover  the opening of the expanded Panama Canal last year might impact the business of western railroads like Union Pacific as it there may be a reduction in freight volumes  Additionally  Trump s policies pertaining to Mexico might adversely affect key railroad players like Kansas City Southern  NYSE        which has significant Mexican exposure  Given that Trump has been critical about free trade with the nation  business relationships with Mexico might take a hit over the next few years  This will hurt Kansas City Southern big time 

Early Prediction for Q1 Earnings Season

	Our  report paints a disappointing picture for the S P 500 members of the broader transportation sector   one of the 16 Zacks sectors including railroads   in the Q1 earnings season  High costs are likely to hurt the bottom line for transports in this earnings cycle  According to the report  earnings for this highly diversified sector are projected to decline 21 7  year over year  The picture is much better with respect to the top line  which is expected to expand 5 9  

What the Zacks Industry Rank Indicates

	The bearish Zacks Industry Rank of   228 carried by the 10 member Transportation Rail industry further highlights the fact that railroads  despite the optimism  are not out of the woods yet  The bearish rank places the industry in the bottom 11  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries

155459,376975,UNP,Can Railroads Prosper Under The Trump Administration ,opinion,"It is a fact that declining coal shipments have hurt railroad stocks in the past few years  Given that coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroad operators  headwinds related to the commodity had affected sector participants big time  However  things are looking up for this key sector  Let s find out why 
Trump Victory a Boon for Railroads 
The victory of President Trump in Nov 2016 turned into a blessing for the sector  This is because of Trump s pro coal stance and emphasis on the need to revive the coal industry  He even went on to say   Coal will last for 1 000 years in this country   
Coal is by far the most stable source of energy the U S  produces  and the industry employs thousands of Americans  Given the President s preference of fossil fuels over renewable energy  we expect a surge in the usage of coal during the Trump regime  Also  Trump advocates increasing jobs in the coal sector and possibly relaxing regulations  Additionally  increase in industrial production will lead to a rise in coal volumes 
Roll Back of Clean Power Plan
Keeping the promises made during the election campaigns  Trump recently inked an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan  The plan was introduced by President Obama in Aug 2015 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity by 32  from the 2005 level by 2030  Trump s move is expected to usher in a new era in American energy and production as well as job creation  leading to greater prosperity 
Naturally  railroads like Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP   UNP   Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC  and CSX Corp   CSX  stand to benefit substantially if the President successfully resurrects the coal industry  With the commodity accounting for approximately over 15  of the revenues for Class I railroads in the U S   any positive development in this regard will support the industry 
In fact  the President had raised questions regarding climate change and its impact during his campaign as well  Trump  who views climate change as  a Chinese hoax  aimed at making U S  manufacturing  non competitive   might pull out from the Paris climate deal  as well 
Will First Quarter Results Improve 
Given the increase in coal demand  railroads might deliver a better performance in the first quarter 2017 earnings season  Even in the fourth quarter of 2016  coal revenues at CSX Corp    a key sector participant   surged 23  year over year to  551 million due to an 8  improvement in volumes  CSX currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
The improving scenario with respect to coal can be gauged from the commentary provided by Union Pacific s CFO  Rob Knight  at the 38th Raymond James Annual Institutional Investors Conference in March  Knight said that coal volumes at Union Pacific had improved 15  as of Feb 28  Volumes of agricultural products had improved 3   Furthermore  Norfolk Southern anticipates coal volumes to increase in 2017 on the back of favorable conditions 
Apart from better coal volumes  efforts of railroads to control costs should drive bottom line growth in the first quarter  Even in the fourth quarter  many railroads had reported improvements with respect to operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  For example  operating ratio at Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU  improved to 64 9  for full year 2016 from 66 4   recorded in 2015  We expect the trend to continue 
We also note that E  Hunter Harrison  CSX Corp  s newly appointed CEO  intends to drive growth at the company by slashing costs  Harrison had adopted similar methods to drive growth at his previous company  Canadian Pacific Railway Limited  CP  
Shareholder Friendly Measures
Investors prefer income generating stocks  Needless to say  companies that have a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments are usually on investors  radar 
Shareholders of major railroads have not been disappointed in this regard of late  Last year  Union Pacific hiked its quarterly dividend payout   Earlier this year  railroads like Canadian National Railway  CNI  and Norfolk Southern did the same 
We are impressed with the company s efforts to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts  For example  Union Pacific returned around  5 billion to its stockholders in 2016 through these investor friendly measures  Of the  5 billion  approximately  3 1 billion have been returned through share buybacks 
Other Tailwinds
Apart from the likely improvement in coal prices  the inauguration of the expanded 102 year old Panama Canal last year bodes well for eastern railroads like Norfolk Southern  This is because container traffic at the ports on the East Coast is expected to increase  Historically  imports from Asia have followed the sea route up to the West Coast and were then transported by road to the East Coast 
Additionally  the decision of major railroads to invest significantly to promote safety and enhance productivity raises optimism  For instance  Union Pacific has announced a  3 1 billion capital plan for 2017  The scheme includes  300 million to further implement Positive Train Control  The plan is in line with the company s efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity 
Conclusion
The above analysis clearly suggests that things are looking up for the railroad industry  Better coal volumes  Trump s pro coal stance  industrial growth alongside improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are likely to help the industry turn around

155460,376976,UNP,Is The Railroad Industry Out Of The Woods Yet ,opinion,"Even though there is an air of optimism in the railroad space  mainly due to President Trump s pro coal stance  there are certain roadblocks that one must be mindful of before investing in the sector  Let s take a look at some of the issues 
Eliminating the Clean Power Plan  Not Easy
In keeping with his promise to revive the coal industry  Trump recently inked an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan  CPP    a major Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  initiative to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants  Generally  any positive coal related development is favorable for railroads  as coal is a key revenue generating commodity for these companies 
However  we note that the executive order is not enough to repeal this plan and many market watchers believe that it will not be an easy task for the new administration to undo it  Not only will the process be extremely time consuming but will also require formulation of new rules  Many procedural and legal hurdles will have to be overcome before Obama s signature climate policy is actually repealed 
Moreover  the desired amount of job additions following the scrapping of the CPP might not actually happen  according to several market watchers  Pera Forbes   the share of coal in total electricity generation is projected to decline to 26  in 2040 from 33  in 2015  even without CPP  Moreover  a significant portion of the population will be subjected to health hazards if CPP is done away with 
Declining coal shipments have hurt the sector significantly in the recent past  This is evident by the below par performances of key sector participants like Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC   Canadian National Railways  CNI   Union Pacific Corp   UNP  and Canadian Pacific Railway  CP  over the past few quarters  In the event of the above pro coal development failing to materialize achieve the desired results  the industry might continue to suffer 
Moreover  Trump s proposal of 13  reduction in federal funding for transports in the 2018 budget may also hurt railroads  Many market watchers believe that the Chicago area would be badly hit if the proposals become a reality  This might harm railroads like Union Pacific  We note that Union Pacific currently serves five facilities in the Chicago area 
The Future of NAFTA to Affect Some Railroads
It is a fact that Trump s victory in the U S  presidential elections had boosted most U S  based railroad stocks  However  the same does not hold true for Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   This is mainly because of the company s large Mexican exposure  The railroad  courtesy of its service networks across both the U S  and Mexico border  dominates the primary rail networks between these countries 
However  Trump has threatened to terminate trade with Mexico  He has called the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    the trade pact inked in 1994 between the U S   Canada  and Mexico   a  disaster   Trump has threatened to come down on companies that have production in Mexico and this  undoubtedly  is bad news for Kansas City Southern  He has also hinted at possibilities of renegotiating NAFTA  In the event of any unfavorable development regarding NAFTA  Union Pacific   which too has Mexican exposure   may be hurt big time alongside Kansas City Southern  No wonder  investors interested in the railroad space keenly await updates on the NAFTA issue 
Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank   3  Hold   You can see  
Other Headwinds
The State Transportation Board s  STB  proposal of reciprocal switching   also referred to as forced access by the Association of American Railroads  AAR  is a major headwind for railroads  In the event of things progressing as currently planned  some railroads may be forced to share their rail traffic with competitors  Consequently  the Association of American Railroads  AAR  is vehemently opposing the rules  calling them the  of  the board s governing statute  economic principles  and long standing policy  
According to AAR  this regulation might disrupt railroad operations  cause revenue losses as well as increase costs  hurting the bottom line  Moreover  according to the Intermodal Association of North America  IANA    declined 2 1  year over year in 2016  This too is a cause for concern 
Zacks Industry Rank
The bearish Zacks Industry rank of 228  out of 256 groups  carried by the  Industry further highlights the fact that railroads will continue to face challenges  despite the optimism surrounding the space  The unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 11  of the Zacks industries 
Conclusion
The write up clearly suggests that the railroads are not bereft of headwinds in spite of the optimism surrounding the space  The challenges can result in investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from the sector

	Additionally  the decision of major railroads to invest significantly to promote safety and enhance productivity raises optimism  For instance  Union Pacific has announced a  3 1 billion capital plan for 2017  The scheme includes  300 million to further implement Positive Train Control  The plan is in line with the company s efforts to promote safety and enhance productivity 

Conclusion

	The above analysis clearly suggests that things are looking up for the railroad industry  Better coal volumes  Trump s pro coal stance  industrial growth alongside improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are likely to help the industry turn around

155462,376978,UNP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Norfolk Southern  Canadian National Railways  Union Pacific  Canadian Pacific Railway And Kansas City Southern,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 24  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Railroads  Part 3  including Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NYSE         Canadian National Railways  NYSE         Union Pacific Corp   NYSE         Canadian Pacific Railway  NYSE        and Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   NYSE        

	Industry  Railroads  Part 3

	Link  

	Even though there is an air of optimism in the railroad space  mainly due to President Trump s pro coal stance  there are certain roadblocks that one must be mindful of before investing in the sector  Let s take a look at some of the issues 

Eliminating the Clean Power Plan  Not Easy

	In keeping with his promise to revive the coal industry  Trump recently inked an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan  CPP    a major Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  initiative to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants  Generally  any positive coal related development is favorable for railroads  as coal is a key revenue generating commodity for these companies 

	However  we note that the executive order is not enough to repeal this plan and many market watchers believe that it will not be an easy task for the new administration to undo it  Not only will the process be extremely time consuming but will also require formulation of new rules  Many procedural and legal hurdles will have to be overcome before Obama s signature climate policy is actually repealed 

	Moreover  the desired amount of job additions following the scrapping of the CPP might not actually happen  according to several market watchers  Pera Forbes    the share of coal in total electricity generation is projected to decline to 26  in 2040 from 33  in 2015  even without CPP  Moreover  a significant portion of the population will be subjected to health hazards if CPP is done away with 

	Declining coal shipments have hurt the sector significantly in the recent past  This is evident by the below par performances of key sector participants like Norfolk Southern Corp   NYSE         Canadian National Railways  NYSE         Union Pacific Corp   NYSE        and Canadian Pacific Railway  NYSE        over the past few quarters  In the event of the above pro coal development failing to materialize achieve the desired results  the industry might continue to suffer 

	Moreover  Trump s proposal of 13  reduction in federal funding for transports in the 2018 budget may also hurt railroads  Many market watchers believe that the Chicago area would be badly hit if the proposals become a reality  This might harm railroads like Union Pacific  We note that Union Pacific currently serves five facilities in the Chicago area 

The Future of NAFTA to Affect Some Railroads

	It is a fact that Trump s victory in the U S  presidential elections had boosted most U S  based railroad stocks  However  the same does not hold true for Kansas City Southern  NYSE         This is mainly because of the company s large Mexican exposure  The railroad  courtesy of its service networks across both the U S  and Mexico border  dominates the primary rail networks between these countries 

	However  Trump has threatened to terminate trade with Mexico  He has called the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA    the trade pact inked in 1994 between the U S   Canada  and Mexico   a  disaster   Trump has threatened to come down on companies that have production in Mexico and this  undoubtedly  is bad news for Kansas City Southern  He has also hinted at possibilities of renegotiating NAFTA  In the event of any unfavorable development regarding NAFTA  Union Pacific   which too has  Mexican exposure   may be hurt big time alongside Kansas City Southern  No wonder  investors interested in the railroad space keenly await updates on the NAFTA issue 

	Kansas City Southern carries a Zacks Rank   3  Hold   You can see   

Other Headwinds

	The State Transportation Board s  STB  proposal of reciprocal switching   also referred to as forced access by the Association of American Railroads  AAR  is a major headwind for railroads  In the event of things progressing as currently planned  some railroads may be forced to share their rail traffic with competitors  Consequently  the Association of American Railroads  AAR  is vehemently opposing the rules  calling them the  of  the board s governing statute  economic principles  and long standing policy  

	According to AAR  this regulation might disrupt railroad operations  cause revenue losses as well as increase costs  hurting the bottom line  Moreover  according to the Intermodal Association of North America  IANA    declined 2 1  year over year in 2016  This too is a cause for concern 

Zacks Industry Rank

	The bearish Zacks Industry rank of 228  out of 256 groups  carried by the  Industry further highlights the fact that railroads will continue to face challenges  despite the optimism surrounding the space  The unfavorable rank places the companies in the bottom 11  of the Zacks industries 

Conclusion

	The write up clearly suggests that the railroads are not bereft of headwinds in spite of the optimism surrounding the space  The challenges can result in investors  especially the risk averse ones  shying away from the sector

155463,376979,UNP,CSX Posts Stellar Q1 Earnings  What s  Ahead For Railroads ,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that the victory of Donald Trump in the U S  presidential elections in Nov 2016 has been a blessing for the railroad space  Stock prices of key sector participants like Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC    CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   and Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP   have moved north following Trump s victory  This is primarily due to the President s pro coal stance and emphasis on the need to resurrect the coal industry 
With coal accounting for over 15  of the revenues for Class I railroads in the U S   any favorable development pertaining to the commodity is naturally a positive for these companies  In fact  the positive impact of Trump s victory on the sector is evident from the fact that the Zacks categorized industry gained 21 8  since Nov 8  handily outperforming the S P500 index  which appreciated 8 2  

Impressive Q1 Led by CSX
In view of the positive sentiment surrounding the space and the improvement of coal volumes  it is of little surprise that railroads are faring well in this earnings season  after struggling in the past few quarters  The most impressive earnings report so far in the space has come from the Jacksonville  FL based CSX Corporation 
The company reported better than expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter  Moreover  both metrics improved on a year over year basis  The improving scenario regarding coal can be determined from the fact that coal revenues surged 31  year over year to  522 million and volumes improved 3  at CSX 
The strong earnings report on Apr 19 naturally pleased investors  Consequently  shares of the company have surged in excess of 8  since then  The optimism surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has improved 7 7  to  2 24 per share  over the last seven days  Also  the company s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  further highlights the positive sentiment surrounding it  You can see  
Other key railroad stocks that have reported so far in the ongoing earnings season also include Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   and Canadian Pacific Railway   NYSE CP    Both of them reported in line earnings  but better than expected revenues  Additionally  their earnings and revenues improved on a year over year basis 
Will Other Big Players Perform Well Too 
The improving scenario with respect to coal bodes well  as far as the rest of the earnings reports in the sector are concerned  According to the commentary provided by Union Pacific s CFO  Rob Knight  at the 38th Raymond James Annual Institutional Investors Conference in March things seem to be looking up for this key revenue generating commodity for railroads  Knight said that coal volumes at Union Pacific had improved 15  as of Feb 28  He also added  volumes of agricultural products had improved 3   Union Pacific is scheduled to report on Apr 27 
Furthermore  Norfolk Southern  which will report on Apr 26  anticipates coal volumes to increase in 2017 on the back of favorable conditions  In fact  our quantitative model hints at earnings beat for Norfolk Southern  According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   to increase the odds of an earnings surprise 
Norfolk Southern satisfies both these conditions  It has an Earnings ESP of  0 74  and carries a Zacks Rank  3  making us reasonably confident of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Other Positives
Apart from better coal volumes  efforts of railroads to control costs are also likely to drive bottom line growth  In fact  the attempts of key railroads to reward shareholders through share repurchase and dividends seem to be a positive  CSX had announced an 11  dividend hike while releasing its first quarter results  Additionally  other railroads like Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd    NYSE CNI   hiked their quarterly dividend payouts earlier this year 
We believe that the raised dividends highlight the commitment of these companies to create value for shareholders as well as underscore their strong financial condition and bright prospects  Further  the decision of major railroads to make significant investments in order to boost safety and productivity raises optimism 
Bottom Line
The above write up clearly suggests that things are looking up for the railroad industry  We believe  better coal volumes  Trump s pro coal stance  industrial growth  alongside improvement in intermodal volumes and pricing are likely to help the industry turn around 
Zacks  2017 IPO Watch List
Before looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth ",2017-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/csx-posts-stellar-q1-earnings:-what's--ahead-for-railroads-200184806,200184806
155496,377012,UNP,3 Hot Transportation Stocks For A Surging Market,opinion,"It is a well documented fact that the widely diversified transportation sector  one of the sixteen Zacks sectors  has had a rough year  The sector has been confronting a number of headwinds like declining air fares  Brexit induced uncertainty  labor strife  technological glitches and weak travel demand due to security fears to name a few 
The above mentioned headwinds resulted in the sector posting a disappointing performance in the third quarter of 2016  According to our  report  earnings for the sector contracted 13 6  
Strong Overall Market Hints at Rebound
Bullish domestic data released over the last month have repeatedly indicated that the U S  economy is picking up steam  For instance  unemployment levels were at a record low in November  According to data released on Friday  the unemployment rate in November fell to its lowest level since Aug 2007 
Moreover  Consumer confidence   a key determinant to the economy s health   rebounded from its weak October showing to hit a nine year high in November  Furthermore  according to the Commerce Department s  second estimate   the U S  economy expanded at a rate of 3 2  during the third quarter  witnessing the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014 
Among other notable releases this month  construction spending improved and the ISM manufacturing and services indexes moved higher  In addition to the bullish releases  expectations of market friendly policies from President elect Donald Trump resulted in the coveted S P 500 Index nearing an all time high in November 
Moreover  the Dow ended the month on a triumphant note  rising during six of the last seven sessions  In fact  the index created eight records over November and breached the 19 000 mark for the first time ever on Nov 22 
Given this bullish sentiment and the increasing strength of the domestic economy  it is natural that the transportation sector is eyeing growth 
Holiday Season   A Catalyst
The ongoing holiday season is expected to aid the attempts of a turnaround for the transportation sector  Travel plans this season are likely to surge due to a number of bullish factors like solid job growth  rising wages and increased consumer spending  which have contributed to an improving economy  The uptick in travel demand should boost revenues and profitability for transports like airlines and railroads  leading to stock price appreciation 
Package delivery majors like FedEx Corp    NYSE FDX   and United Parcel Service  Inc    NYSE UPS   expect to make the most of this holiday season owing to growth in e commerce  To meet the surge in demand  FedEx has hired more than 50 000 seasonal workers  The company has added 19 fully automated stations and four major distribution hubs since the last peak season 
Moreover  FedEx has added 30 aircraft to its fleet since last year  Each of the four Mondays during the upcoming peak period is anticipated to be among the busiest in its history 
United Parcel has hired around 95 000 seasonal workers to meet the high demand  Shipping volume during the peak period this year is expected to increase around 14  on a year over year basis  The company expects to deliver more than 700 million packages across the globe  during the Thanksgiving and New Year s Eve period  The presence of two extra operational days in the period is a positive  The company expects to deliver more than 30 million packages in 13 of the 21 holiday delivery days before Christmas 
Railroads Likely to Grow Under Trump Administration
Currently  railroads like Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC   and Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP   are suffering due to declining coal shipments  However  the election of Donald Trump as the President last month  is likely to usher in good news for the sector participants  This is because during his campaign Trump had issued statements in favor of reviving the beleaguered coal industry 
In his very words   Coal will last for 1 000 years in this country   Given that coal is a key revenue generating commodity for railroads  Trump s pro coal stance is certainly a positive for the companies in this space  Moreover  Trump s promise to spend more on infrastructure raises optimism for railroads 
How to Identify the Outperformers  
Given the favorable backdrop  it is a prudent idea for investors to add stocks from the transportation sector to their portfolio for higher returns  However  the task of selecting the right stock is by no means an easy one  given the high degree of diversity in the transportation space  The process is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack  unless one is aware of an appropriate method to make the right choice 
This is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy  In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank the stocks have market capitalization of over  1 billion

155498,377014,UNP,Railroad Stock Industry Outlook   April 2017,opinion,"With Q1 earnings season upon us  companies like Zacks Rank  2  Buy  rated CSX Corp   CSX  and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CP  are kick starting the earnings season for the Railroads sector tomorrow  Apr 19  With stocks in the space having struggled over the past few quarters  mainly due to coal related headwinds  we wait to see if the sector displays an improved performance this time around  You can see  
Nevertheless  the positive sentiment surrounding the space mainly due to the favorable scenario regarding coal volumes in 2017 raises optimism  Given that coal is a key revenue generator for railroad operators  the commodity is the primary determinant of the fate of the sector participants  Impressive industrial volume growth should boost results in the coming periods as well 
Will Railroads Gain from Trump s Victory 
Key railroads like Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC    NSC   CSX Corp  and Union Pacific Corp   UNP  have seen a surge in their stock prices following the election of President Trump  Trump s pro coal stance and promises to revive the coal industry were big contributors to the upside as is the expectation of an overall pro growth fiscal and regulatory policy regime 
The new administration s pro coal policy stance is expected to help the commodity s demand  Trump s skepticism of climate change issues and focus on reviving the country s manufacturing base is a potentially long term positive for fossil fuel based electricity generation  Trump s recent executive action rolling back the preceding administration s environmental stipulations about carbon emissions are a practical manifestation of this policy stance  Other plans include doing away with the ban on coal leasing on federal lands  scrapping regulations to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production  and reconsidering the  social cost  of carbon emissions in all regulatory actions 
Coal fired plants are likely to gain the most from these actions  With coal accounting for over 15  of the revenues for Class I railroads in the U S   any favorable development pertaining to the commodity is a positive for these companies 
Other Positives
We are positive on the efforts of railroads like Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific to cut costs in order to boost their bottom line  Norfolk Southern is on track to generate annual savings to the tune of  650 million by 2020  The company s operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  improved 510 basis points to 69 4  in the fourth quarter of 2016  Operating ratio of below 65  is targeted by 2020  The efforts of key railroads to reward shareholders through share repurchases and dividends also impress  In fact  railroads like Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   CNI  have recently hiked their quarterly dividend payouts 
We believe that the raised dividends highlight the commitment of these companies to create value for shareholders as well as underscore their strong financial condition and bright prospects  Additionally  the decision of major railroads to make significant investments to boost safety and productivity raises optimism 
Valuation Picture
The Zacks Rail Transportation industry is up  8 9  in the year to date period  outperforming the  4 9  gain for the S P 500 index in the same time period  The industry is up  27 4  over the past year vs   11 4  for the index as a whole 
As a result of this strong performance  the industry s valuation is no longer cheap  The Zacks Rail Transportation industry is currently at 18 3X the consensus forward 12 month EPS estimates  which is towards the high end of the 5 year trading range of 12 8X to 18 7X  The 5 year median forward 12 month PE multiple is 15 6X  The industry was trading at a discount to the S P 500 index based on this multiple since February 2015  and has shifted to a premium since the start of the year 
Headwinds
While there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about railroads  the space is not entirely bereft of headwinds  Although Trump inked an executive order to repeal the Clean Power Plan  many market watchers believe that it will not be easy for the new administration to eliminate the plan  Not only will the process be extremely time consuming  but will also necessitate the formulation new rules 
Moreover  the revival of coal may not be as expected  According to a Forbes   the share of coal in total electricity generation is projected to decline to 26  in 2040 from 33  in 2015  even if the Clean Power Plan is scrapped 
Last month  Trump proposed a 13  reduction in federal funding for transports in the 2018 budget  Per the proposal  spending for this sector will be reduced by  2 4 billion from  18 4 billion outlined in the 2017 budget  One of the important features of the proposal is to stop federal funding for long distance Amtrak trains  Although it remains to be seen up to what extent railroads will be hurt by the spending cut  many market watchers believe that the Chicago area would be the worst hit if the proposals are accepted  This might hurt railroads like Union Pacific  We note that Union Pacific currently serves five facilities in the Chicago area 
Moreover  the opening of the expanded Panama Canal last year might impact the business of western railroads like Union Pacific as it there may be a reduction in freight volumes  Additionally  Trump s policies pertaining to Mexico might adversely affect key railroad players like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU   which has significant Mexican exposure  Given that Trump has been critical about free trade with the nation  business relationships with Mexico might take a hit over the next few years  This will hurt Kansas City Southern big time 
Early Prediction for Q1 Earnings Season
Our  report paints a disappointing picture for the S P 500 members of the broader transportation sector   one of the 16 Zacks sectors including railroads   in the Q1 earnings season  High costs are likely to hurt the bottom line for transports in this earnings cycle  According to the report  earnings for this highly diversified sector are projected to decline 21 7  year over year  The picture is much better with respect to the top line  which is expected to expand 5 9  
What the Zacks Industry Rank Indicates
The bearish Zacks Industry Rank of   228 carried by the 10 member Transportation Rail industry further highlights the fact that railroads  despite the optimism  are not out of the woods yet  The bearish rank places the industry in the bottom 11  of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries

155531,377047,UNP,What Today s Investor Can Learn From The Black Friday Gold Collapse,opinion,"Here s a story I bet you haven t heard before  It s worth a read on a long holiday weekend  This interesting tale details the original  Black Friday    a day that every American should know and understand 
After all  you ll notice some eerie similarities between past and present  Virtually the same calamity could happen today 
The financial tragedy started in the late 1860s with something no government can resist tackling  America s leaders were manipulating its currency in hopes of boosting the economy 
You see  America was loaded with debt after the Civil War  The federal government had issued hordes of paper money  backed by little more than a promise  These  greenbacks  pushed gold coins out of the market  sending the price of the precious metal plummeting 
It s not all that different from the fiat currency in our wallets today  If it were suddenly backed by gold  a very limited resource   the price of the metal would surge 
Andrew Johnson knew it  So as part of his post war economic stimulus plan  the government began buying the fiat currency and replacing it with money backed by Washington s huge stockpile of gold 
In other words  America traded a flimsy government promise for something with real value   something the economy could build on 
No Good Deed 
Two men   Jay Gould and Jim Fisk   took note of the plan and worked to take advantage of it  They were convinced the price of the metal would soar  but only after the government stopped flooding the market with its gold stockpile 
At the time  Washington controlled the then tiny gold market  If prices rose  it would lower them by selling its gold  If prices dipped  it d buy and raise the metal s price 
Believing the government would eventually stop selling gold or would flat out run out of the stuff  Gould and Fisk saw an opportunity  They d buy gold and wait for the government to stop selling 
But then Ulysses Grant took office  He vowed to continue the plan by dumping even more gold into the market 
Gould and Fisk didn t like the idea  Not a bit 
So they did what any good lobbyist with a chunk of change at stake would do  They cozied up to the right people and offered to line their pockets  In this case  they became good  friends  with the man married to Grant s sister  They used him to get close to Grant  where they could directly influence his thoughts on gold 
It worked 
They got Grant to name another of their schemers to a high post at the Treasury  In fact  he was put in charge of the gold sales  As a man on the inside  he d alert Gould and Fisk if and when the government was going to push more of its gold stockpile onto the market and lower prices 
With their scheme in place  the nefarious duo bought their gold  A lot of it  They eventually ended up with some  60 million worth of the metal 
Their buying sparked a fast moving bull market as other investors took note and piled in 
Over the span of just a couple weeks in 1869  the price of gold soared  The value of a  100 gold piece surged to  130    then  140    all the way to  160 
Grant soon got suspicious  He uncovered bribes offered to his wife and family 
He knew he got duped 
Brutal Payback
On Wednesday  September 22  Gould found out his plot was foiled  His man on the inside quietly told him Grant was onto him and would soon flood the market with gold 
Gould secretly started selling his gold the next day    sheepishly neglecting to tell his partner in crime who had millions on the line 
On Friday  September 24  word hit Wall Street  A telegraph hit New York announcing Grant was breaking the bull s back  He ordered the Treasury to dump  4 million worth of gold into the open market 
Prices plunged 
The markets were stunned    as was Fisk 
Almost instantly  gold fell by 20   Stocks followed in kind  Foreign trade came to a halt  Commodity prices imploded  dipping by more than 50  
Investors went bankrupt  And the economy was shattered 
 Black Friday   as it quickly became known  was painful 
And yet  as remains oh so true today  the perpetrators walked away unscathed  Although his partner let him hang out to dry  Fisk never realized his losses  He lied and said his brokers bought the gold without his permission  They paid the bill 
Gould  you ll remember  sold much of his gold the day before the meltdown  He walked away with some  12 million 
Although Grant tried  the government found them guilty of no crimes 
Gould went on to use his newfound wealth to build an empire  He eventually controlled the Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  Railroad  Western Union Telegraph Company and the Manhattan Elevated Railroad 
Fisk  on the other hand  later got shot and killed    supposedly over some money and a girl named Josie 
The first Black Friday took place nearly 150 years ago  And yet the same themes run true today 
Washington is still manipulating the economy    to the benefit of a few 
Gold still surges and falls on a whim 
The well connected  white collar criminals that set the financial world in a tailspin rarely get punished 
And men still get shot over money and women 
Some things   especially on Wall Street   never change ",2016-11-27,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-today’s-investor-can-learn-from-the-black-friday-gold-collapse-200166747,200166747

155584,377100,UNP,Railroads  A Turnaround In Sight ,opinion,"Opinions remain mixed among analysts and industry decision makers on whether the Railroads industry will shift towards a growth trajectory  While some believe that earnings have bottomed  others feel that unprecedented economic woes will likely continue to impede growth  However  post earnings season  a string of factors can be evaluated to speculate that a positive turn might be on the cards for this industry 
Expected Increase in Grain Production   Intermodal Volume
The agricultural segment is expected to support growth for railroad companies that would follow a period of declining volumes as a result of lower grain production in Canada and the U S  But hopes remain high that the coming crop size in Canada and the U S  will be the 5 year average  which should be beneficial to the railroad industry 
Another segment to consider is Intermodal which accounts for the bulk of revenues for most railroad companies  This segment has also been a drag of late  However  the positive outlook issued by the Intermodal Association of North America   IANA   signals at an increase in volumes in 2016  IANA expects intermodal volumes to increase by 3 4  in 2016 
As per a Journal of Commerce   JOC   article  intermodal volumes inched up 2  in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015  An increase in intermodal volumes can help railroad operators offset revenue losses stemming from the weak coal and energy segments  Notably  within intermodal  imports are a key factor driving growth 
Class I Railroads  Outlook   Investments 
Investments in a sector are always a solid indication of future projections by company management  Some of the major railroad companies have made commendable investments in the sector this year and there are several more in the pipeline 
Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  recently invested over  150 million in the development of its rail infrastructure in regions such as Oregon  Nevada  Wyoming  Utah and Washington  The investments are part of the company s total planned capital expenditure of  3 75 billion for this year  Notably  the company has spent almost  33 billion in the past decade which has resulted in a 25  decrease in derailments 
Meanwhile  Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC   NSC  has planned investments of  2 1 billion this year for rail safety network enhancements  operational efficiency improvement and growth opportunities  Canadian Pacific is targeting an investment of approximately C 2 75 billion this year as part of its capital program  out of which C 1 5 billion is for the enhancement of track infrastructure 
According to a Maquila Portal report  Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU   KSU  intends to put in  154 million in Sanchez  Nuevo Laredo Backyard  in Tamaulipas in railway infrastructure and modifications  expansion of Interpuerto facilities  track maintenance  and new equipment and systems  Mexican operations account for a bulk of Kansas City Southern s revenues 
CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX   CSX  recently raised its capital investments projection for 2016 by  300 million to  2 7 billion to include accelerated payments for locomotives throughout 2016 
Although investments have declined slightly for some companies as compared to the previous year  the fact that companies are still opting to make sizable investments is encouraging 
Expansion of Panama Canal
The expansion of the 102 year old Panama Canal in June  in order to let huge container ships carrying upto 14 000 containers to navigate across it  initially raised concerns for railroads  Although it does hold that volumes for railroads transporting freight between the U S  west to east coast might get affected  the enhanced Panama Canal might actually favor companies with extensive operations on the U S  east coast and those shipping to the Gulf Coast 
Companies expected to benefit from the Panama Canal expansion include Norfolk Southern  CSX Corp   Canadian National  CNI  and Canadian Pacific  Moreover  the canal expansion might eventually lead to higher shipments to ports along the coast but only if economic conditions in the U S  improve 
Rebound in the Cards 
It cannot be said for certain if the railroad industry can actually start seeing earnings growth over the next few quarters  One of the key reasons for the uncertainty is economic factors which give no clear indication on where the economy is headed  The Fed continues to hold rates at the current level despite signaling at the prospects of a hike 
Meanwhile  events such as Brexit  slowdown in the Chinese economy  low oil prices and a tepid growth in emerging economies have kept markets in turmoil this year  However  a favorable U S  job report  possible uptick in industrial growth and rise in domestic consumption may provide the much needed boost to the economy  thus propelling growth in industries such as railroads

Chicago  IL   August 15  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Railroads  part 3  including like Union Pacific Corp  NYSE UNP       CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX       Canadian National Railways Corp     and Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC       

Industry  Railroads  part 3

Link  

The railroad sector has not been able to put up a decent second quarter earnings season  Across the board  most stocks suffered year over year declines in earnings  Though most Class 1 railroad companies beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the declining earnings trend is a matter of concern  Furthermore  there has been no major development to suggest a speedy recovery for the industry  Energy markets and continued issues with the factor sector appear to be the key reasons behind the slump in earnings performance 

Lack of Uniform Growth

For the railroad industry  steady economic growth is an essential requirement to boost freight volumes  The U S  economy keeps giving out mixed signals  making it tough for anyone to gauge where it is headed  This uncertain environment is the primary reason keeping the Fed on hold from announcing the next rate increase  While parts of the U S  economy appear to be doing fine  bug chunks remain in a depressed state 

The manufacturing sector in particular is barely in expansionary territory  though some of the recent signs suggest that the wort may be behind us  As a result  GDP growth has barely reached the 1  level in each of the last three quarters  though expectations remain high for a rebound in the current period 

Beyond the U S  economy  the outlook remains fairly uncertain for many of our trading partners  with Britain s exit from the European Union adding another source of uncertainty to an already cloudy environment  Questions about China  recession in Brazil and an overall weak global growth environment is having a negative impact as well  particularly through the trade channel 

Energy Markets  Impact on Earnings

The energy market has a significant impact on railroad revenues  Coal  a major freight product for most railroad companies  has been observing a consistent decline in volumes  This has hurt the top line of companies like Union Pacific Corp      CSX Corp      Canadian National Railways Corp     and Norfolk Southern Corp       Coal volumes have suffered do to two key reasons  First  sluggish industrial growth has resulted in low demand for coal 

Industrial growth in the U S  is unlikely to improve significantly in the coming few months as a result of which coal volumes are expected to trudge along at a slow pace  Second reason hampering coal volumes  the shift to renewable and more environment friendly sources for electricity  As per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis   IEEFA    new carbon related regulations will result in a 25  decline in coal production by 2040  Clean energy requirements could significantly reduce coal consumption by power plants 

Moreover  even if changes do not take place  coal demand is expected to stay flat over the next 25 years  A McKinsey report recently highlighted that by 2020  natural gas is expected to surpass coal as the major source of electricity production in the U S  The growing popularity and need for renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind energy will eventually reduce reliance on coal  Thus  railroad companies are not expected to see any improvement in coal related revenues 

Another energy component  crude oil  has also been impacting rail revenues  Crude oil prices have remained low over the past couple of months in addition to lower demand for the commodity  While low crude prices have helped railroads cut costs  it has taken a toll on revenues due to reduced income from low fuel surcharge 

According to the U S  Energy Information Administration  Brent crude oil prices are expected to average  44 per barrel in 2016 and  52 per barrel in 2017  Thus not much change is expected from fuel surcharge revenues for railroads over the next couple of months 

New Regulation Threat

The Surface Transportation Board  STB  of the U S  has come up with a new proposal to allow reciprocal switching for captive shippers  This proposal was presented to the STB in 2011 by shippers  After evaluation  the proposal was recently tabled to railroad companies  As per the proposal  captive shippers who have access to only one railroad will be allowed to switch between rail lines of different companies  This proposal has received intense opposition from railroad stocks since it may result in revenue loss and an increase in costs for such companies 

Moreover  rail companies are also skeptical of operational issues and safety concerns arising from the proposed regulation  Another new regulation proposed by Freight Railroad Administration  FRA  is for increasing the crew size on railways from one to a minimum of two persons  This proposal too is being opposed by railroad companies as it would increase operating expenses  If these proposals get sanctioned  especially the reciprocal switching one  these are likely to adversely impact the profits in the railroad industry 

To Conclude

We are skeptic about the railroad stocks  ability to perform well in the current market scenario  There is a pressing need for a positive indicator to drive growth  For the time being  it is to be seen whether rail companies can return to growth despite the prevailing challenges

Another segment to consider is Intermodal which accounts for the bulk of revenues for most railroad companies  This segment has also been a drag of late  However  the positive outlook issued by the Intermodal Association of North America   IANA   signals at an increase in volumes in 2016  IANA expects intermodal volumes to increase by 3 4  in 2016 

As per a Journal of Commerce   JOC   article  intermodal volumes inched up 2  in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015  An increase in intermodal volumes can help railroad operators offset revenue losses stemming from the weak coal and energy segments  Notably  within intermodal  imports are a key factor driving growth 

Class I Railroads  Outlook   Investments 

Investments in a sector are always a solid indication of future projections by company management  Some of the major railroad companies have made commendable investments in the sector this year and there are several more in the pipeline 

Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  recently invested over  150 million in the development of its rail infrastructure in regions such as Oregon  Nevada  Wyoming  Utah and Washington  The investments are part of the company s total planned capital expenditure of  3 75 billion for this year  Notably  the company has spent almost  33 billion in the past decade which has resulted in a 25  decrease in derailments 

Meanwhile  Norfolk Southern Corp    has planned investments of  2 1 billion this year for rail safety network enhancements  operational efficiency improvement and growth opportunities  Canadian Pacific is targeting an investment of approximately C 2 75 billion this year as part of its capital program  out of which C 1 5 billion is for the enhancement of track infrastructure 

According to a Maquila Portal report  Kansas City Southern    intends to put in  154 million in Sanchez  Nuevo Laredo Backyard  in Tamaulipas in railway infrastructure and modifications  expansion of Interpuerto facilities  track maintenance  and new equipment and systems  Mexican operations account for a bulk of Kansas City Southern s revenues 

CSX Corp    recently raised its capital investments projection for 2016 by  300 million to  2 7 billion to include accelerated payments for locomotives throughout 2016 

Although investments have declined slightly for some companies as compared to the previous year  the fact that companies are still opting to make sizable investments is encouraging 

Expansion of Panama Canal

The expansion of the 102 year old Panama Canal in June  in order to let huge container ships carrying upto 14 000 containers to navigate across it  initially raised concerns for railroads  Although it does hold that volumes for railroads transporting freight between the U S  west to east coast might get affected  the enhanced Panama Canal might actually favor companies with extensive operations on the U S  east coast and those shipping to the Gulf Coast 

Companies expected to benefit from the Panama Canal expansion include Norfolk Southern  CSX Corp   Canadian National     and Canadian Pacific  Moreover  the canal expansion might eventually lead to higher shipments to ports along the coast but only if economic conditions in the U S  improve 

Rebound in the Cards 

It cannot be said for certain if the railroad industry can actually start seeing earnings growth over the next few quarters  One of the key reasons for the uncertainty is economic factors which give no clear indication on where the economy is headed  The Fed continues to hold rates at the current level despite signaling at the prospects of a hike 

Meanwhile  events such as Brexit  slowdown in the Chinese economy  low oil prices and a tepid growth in emerging economies have kept markets in turmoil this year  However  a favorable U S  job report  possible uptick in industrial growth and rise in domestic consumption may provide the much needed boost to the economy  thus propelling growth in industries such as railroads

155597,377113,UNP,Railway Stocks Head To Head  Union Pacific  UNP  Vs  CSX Co   CSX  ,opinion,"Union Pacific   NYSE UNP   and CSX Co    NASDAQ CSX   are two of the largest railway companies in the United States  and operate on opposite sides of the country  The Union Pacific system operates in 23 states west of Chicago  IL and New Orleans  LA  By comparison  the CSX system map starts from the Midwest and spans most of the Eastern U S 
Both companies currently sit at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   and fall within the TRANS RAIL industry  which currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 109 265 and falls within the top 41  of all industries 
Although on the surface these two companies appear very similar  we ll take a deeper look at each one and ascertain which would make the better investment 
CSX
Founded in 1986 by the combination of two railway companies  CSX is based in Jacksonville  FL  Together with its subsidiaries  CSX provides rail based transportation services in both the U S  and Canada  Furthermore  it also transports agricultural products  food and beverages  chemicals  automotive products  metals  and industrial products  amongst others  CSX s rail network currently spans over 21 000 miles 
CSX s beta of 1 34 indicates that it has 134  the volatility of the market since its listing in November of 1980  CSX has a trailing 12 month Return on Equity of 15 2  and shareholder s equity  or in other words a net worth of  11 6 billion 
CSX has a P E  Price to Earnings  ratio of 15 41  which compared to the industry average of 16 99 indicates that the company may be a bit overvalued  UNP has a Price Sales ratio  P S  of 2 27 and Price Book ratio  P B  of 2 23  which are lower and equal to the industry s 2 40 and 2 23 and further support this idea  These metrics indicate that CSX is  pun intended  on the right track 
There is currently an 83  agreement in downward earnings estimate revisions amongst analysts for Q3  with current estimates at  0 47 per share  down from  0 48 per share 60 days ago  There is also an 89  agreement in downward revisions for this fiscal year  with estimates currently at  1 75 per share  down from  1 79 60 days ago 
CSX surprised on its earnings report Wednesday  where it announced it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 44 by three cents  surprise of 6 82    but narrowly missed revenue estimates  For information on CSX earnings  check out  
CSX has an average earnings surprise of 3 79  for the last four quarters 
Union Pacific
Founded in 1862 and based in Omaha  NE  UNP is a name that carries a lot of weight and history  Through its subsidiary  Union Pacific Railroad Company  UNP offers freight transportation for agricultural products  food and beverages  automotive products  and industrial products  UNP s rail network currently spans 32 084 route miles 
UNP s beta of 0 96 indicates that it has 96  the volatility of the market based on data from when the stock was first listed in January of 1978  UNP has a trailing 12 month ROE of 22 2   which given its shareholder s equity of  20 5 billion is more impressive than CSX  because it is worth more yet managed to make a higher proportion of its worth back                                                            
UNP has a net profit margin of 21 88  this year  a value that has consistently increased for the company over the years  A net profit margin of 21 88  indicates that for every dollar of revenue UNP produces  it generates about 22 cents in profit 
UNP has a P E ratio of 17 90  which compared to the industry average of 16 99 does indicate that the company may be a bit overvalued at the moment  UNP has a P S ratio of 3 68 and P B ratio of 3 78  which are higher than the industry s 2 40 and 2 23 and further support this idea  However  investors can interpret these values as the confidence of other investors in the value of UNP moving forward 
There is currently 100  agreement in downward earnings estimate revisions amongst analysts for Q2  with current estimates at  1 17 per share  down from  1 20 per share 60 days ago  There is also an 89  agreement in downward revisions for this fiscal year  with estimates currently at  5 14 per share  down from  5 19 60 days ago 
UNP also surprised in its last earnings report  when its reported EPS of  1 16 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  0 07 for a surprise of 6 42   UNP has an average earnings surprise of 1 48  for the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
Based on their financials  both CSX and UNP are not too far apart in their industry  with CSX slightly undervalued and UNP slightly overvalued  However  UNP is the larger and more profitable company 
Investors should note that both companies do currently sit at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   meaning that regardless of which the better investment is  right now may not be the time to jump in  However  based on their long history  stable track record and sheer size  UNP may be a safer bet for long term portfolios 
However  for those interested in the railway industry  CSX has potential moving forward as well  so investors should keep an eye out for it ",2016-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/railway-stocks-head-to-head:-union-pacific-(unp)-vs.-csx-co.-(csx)-200141971,200141971

155644,377160,UNP,Derailment In Oregon Raises Question On Rail Safety ,opinion,"Safety issues associated with the transportation of crude oil via train have been inviting speculations for long  The prevalence of crude by rail shipments has resulted in multiple derailments of railcars  given the inadequate safety standards 
According to a Reuters report  there have been at least 10 major oil train derailments since 2008 in the U S  and Canada alone  Such accidents result in rail cars catching fire  often causing large scale oil spills 
Latest Derailment Rages Havoc
The most recent derailment was reported in the state of Oregon late last week  The train  carrying crude oil  was operated by Omaha  Nebraska based railroad operator Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    According to the report  eleven of the 96 tank cars of the oil train ran off its rails  resulting in a major fire and oil spill from one of the cars  The company has apparently held  track failure  responsible for the mishap  The incident necessitated the evacuation of a small town  Mosier  in the state  Thankfully  no injuries have been reported  Notably  this derailment closely follows Union Pacific s announcement of plans to invest  34 6 million in the improvement of the transportation infrastructure in Oregon 
Meanwhile  the Oregon derailment is the first major accident of such nature this year  highlighting the risks associated with the practice of oil transportation via rail 
Rail Safety  A Pressing Issue 
Apparently  the tank cars involved in the accident were CPC 1232 models  The safety features of these cars have been in question for quite a while  In a bid to ensure safety  U S  lawmakers had extended the deadline for the installation of positive train control  PTC    advanced safety technology   by railroad operators to Dec 31  2018  PTC is designed to automatically stop a train before accidents 
The above legislation  which calls for replacement of older tank cars  addition of electronic braking systems and imposition of speed limits  was introduced last year  Apart from approving the three year extension to Dec 31  2018  Congress stated that under certain conditions  railroads can have an extension of up to 2020 
According to media reports several railroad companies including Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC    Canadian National Railway   NYSE CNI   and CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   have informed federal regulators about their incapability to install PTC before 2020  However  according to the FRA  some railroads like Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU   plan to deploy PTC by 2018 end 
We note that initially the 2008 Rail Safety Improvement Act needed railroad operators to install PTC systems by the end of 2015   According to experts  the deadly Amtrak crash in May 2015 could have been prevented through PTC systems  A probe was launched against leading airlines like Delta Air Lines   NYSE DAL   and American Airlines Group   NASDAQ AAL   for possible price gouging  They were accused of hiking ticket prices to unusual levels  taking advantage of the suspension of train service following the crash ",2016-06-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/derailment-in-oregon-raises-question-on-rail-safety-200134580,200134580
155645,377161,UNP,Union Pacific  High Dividend Growth And A Durable Moat,opinion,"The railroad industry is extremely durable  and Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  has proven to be no exception since its founding in the 1860s 
Railcars are a critical mode of transportation and move about 40  of U S  freight as measured in ton miles  the length freight travels   Without companies like Union Pacific  the country s supply chain could not operate 
Perhaps it is no surprise why Warren Buffett acquired leading railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe  BNSF  in 2010 for  34 billion  adding the company to Berkshire Hathaway s portfolio of high quality dividend stocks 
Union Pacific shares a number of qualities with BNSF and should be of interest to long term dividend growth investors  especially since the stock has pulled back on weak commodity fundamentals Business OverviewUnion Pacific owns and operates over 32 000 miles of railroads linking 23 states in the western two thirds of the United States 
Its railways connect with all of the major ports on the West Coast and Gulf Coast and serve many of the fastest growing cities in the country  Union Pacific s rail network also connects with some of Canada s railways and all of Mexico s major gateways 
The company serves approximately 10 000 customers across a variety of industries including agriculture  17  of 2015 freight revenue   automotive  11    chemicals  17    coal  16    industrial  19    and intermodal  20   Business Analysis  Union PacificU S  railroads were financially and operationally challenged under stringent government oversight until the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated the industry 
According to the Federal Railroad Administration  prior to 1980  railroads had little flexibility in pricing their services and restructuring their operations to become more efficient 
During periods of inflation  regulation slowed down rate adjustments that railroad operators could realize  crimping profits and causing a number of railways to declare bankruptcy 
In the 30 years leading up to 1980  railroads saw their share of revenue ton miles plunge from 56 1  to 37 5   The outlook was bleak 
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 changed everything  Railroads implemented market based pricing schemes on many routes  invested over  500 billion in capital improvements and maintenance to improve productivity  and train accident rates fell by 65  from 1981 to 2009 
Impressively  the lack of government oversight resulted in freight rates declining by 0 5  per year compared to an increase of nearly 3  per year in the five years leading up to act s passage in 1980 
The industry s market share also increased back to 40  of ton miles and has remained stable  Today  about 20  of railway traffic is still regulated where competition is not deemed to be effective enough to protect shippers 
Throughout the last several decades  the railroad industry has significantly consolidated in an effort to further improve productivity  raise profit margins  and better combat alternative modes of transportation  e g  trucks  
Of the 140 000 rail miles in the U S  today  Union Pacific  BNSF  and Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC  account for more than 84 000 miles  over 60  of total rail miles  
The barriers to entry in the industry are high because building and maintaining railroads is extremely capital intensive 
While most types of businesses will spend between 2 4  of their total sales on capital expenditures to maintain and grow their operations  Union Pacific expects spending to average around 16 17  of revenue 
Over the last decade alone  Union Pacific has invested  33 billion in its rail network to maintain and upgrade its transportation infrastructure 
Smaller operators cannot match the company s spending  and Union Pacific s routes present another barrier to entry 
Simply put  the market is only big enough to support a small handful of operators in most areas because it is so expensive to build and maintain a railroad 
The large incumbents have the scale and efficiencies needed to underprice potential new entrants and remain in control of their key markets 
There are also only so many major transportation hubs and consumer markets  further limiting competition 
Union Pacific has the best access to Gulf and West Coast ports and is the only railroad that serves all six major rail gateways between the U S  and Mexico  Through rail industry partnerships  the company can also access roughly 90  of the population in North America 
Major railroad operators have enjoyed strong pricing power due to many of the factors discussed above 
From 2012 through 2015  Union Pacific s average annual pricing gain was 3 6   and the company continues to realize pricing improvements even despite the current slump in commodity shipments 
Thanks to consistent pricing gains and efficiency improvements  Union Pacific improved its operating ratio from 87 5  in 2004 to 63 1  in 2015 
The company expects volume growth  core pricing increases  and productivity gains to further improve its operating ratio to 60  on a full year basis by 2019 
Looking even longer term  Union Pacific began its  G55   0  initiative in the fall of 2015  This program has a goal of achieving a 55  operating ratio over time with a goal of zero injuries 
As long as Union Pacific continues to invest in its infrastructure to maintain leading safety and efficiency metrics  it s hard to imagine new rail competition disrupting its business 
The company s competitive advantages should only strengthen in future years as it invests to become safer  more efficient  and extremely productive 
Finally  it s worth acknowledging the long term durability of the railroad industry  Freight volumes generally follow population growth over long periods of time 
According to the Federal Railroad Administration  the U S  freight system will enjoy a 22  increase in the total amount of tonnage its moves between 2010 and 2035 as the U S  population expands 
There will always be a need to connect consumers with agricultural  industrial  manufacturing  and logistics centers across the country  As a best in class operator with hard to replicate assets  Union Pacific will be there to meet this major need Key RisksUnion Pacific s stock slumped over 30  in 2015  driven by a 6  volume decline and an unfavorable shift in business mix  Each of the company s business groups recorded a decline in freight revenues except for automotive 
The slump in grain prices  plunge in the price of oil  strengthening U S  dollar  and continued decline in the use of coal all contributed to Union Pacific s weakness in 2015 
While I view railroads as having an economic moat  that doesn t mean demand for their services is inelastic  Macro volatility can whip quarterly results around and should be expected with an investment in Union Pacific 
However  in most cases  macro volatility  and potential safety or operational hiccups  shouldn t impact the company s long term earnings power 
Coal could prove to be an exception  Union Pacific transports coal to power companies and industrial facilities and generated 16  of its freight revenue last year from the commodity 
Freight revenue from coal shipments fell by 22  in 2015 and show no sign of recovering   maybe ever 
Coal as a percentage of U S  electricity generation fell from 38 5  in 2014 to about 33  in 2015  The Energy Information Association projects that coal will only comprise 31  of U S  electricity generation in 2016 
The shift away from coal is being driven by new power plant emission regulations and low natural gas prices  which are accelerating the shift of electricity generation away from coal to natural gas 
While no one knows when and where coal fundamentals will begin to stabilize  coal will likely remain an important source of power generation   investors are very aware of the headwind at this point 
At less than 15  of total freight revenue in the first quarter of 2016  Union Pacific s exposure to coal looks increasingly manageable 
While there is risk that the company overinvested and might have too much capacity the next few years  it has so far done an excellent job tightening up its costs in response to the challenging operating environment 
Union Pacific s operating ratio continues improving  and the company remains in good financial health 
Aside from the secular decline in coal  competition from other modes of transportation could pose a threat to Union Pacific s long term earnings power if they take share away from railroads 
Trucks  barges  ships  planes  and pipelines all compete with railroads to efficiently and reliably transport goods 
Rail transportation has been  and will likely continue to be  the best option for shipping bulk commodities such as grain  construction materials  and energy products 
These materials have a high weight to price ratio and generally do not require time sensitive deliveries  Railroads can transport these bulk materials using less fuel than trucks over long distances and are usually faster than using waterways  which face physical limitations  I expect rail s market share of ton miles to remain stable around 40  just like it has for a couple of decades 
Overall  barring a secular decline in commodity consumption  it s hard to find many risks that could impair Union Pacific s long term earnings power 
The next few quarters could remain rocky as unpredictable commodity markets fluctuate  but that has no bearing on Union Pacific s competitive advantages 
Dividend Analysis  Union PacificWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Despite the slump in commodities  Union Pacific s dividend payment looks very safe  The company s solid Dividend Safety Score of 84 is driven by its relatively low payout ratio  excellent free cash flow generation  stable returns  and reasonable balance sheet 
Before diving in to the company s status today  conservative dividend investors might wonder why Union Pacific cut its dividend by more than half in 1998  After all  there are many blue chip dividend stocks with better long term track records of reliable dividend payments 
The issue that impacted Union Pacific in 1998 isn t one that will likely be repeated  The company had acquired Southern Pacific Rail Corporation for  5 4 billion in 1996 and faced substantial operational challenges on a major track 
Congestion had become a big problem on the single direction track following the acquisition  resulting in lost sales as customers turned to more reliable operators 
Union Pacific ultimately issued up to  1 billion in equity related securities and cut its dividend to rebuild part of its railway  The company had been operating at a loss during this period 
Today  there are no such operational issues facing the company  and the business is in much better financial health  Given its size  another large merger is also unlikely 
Since the dividend cut in 1998  Union Pacific has paid uninterrupted dividends and increased its dividend each year since 2007 
Union Pacific targets a dividend payout ratio of about 35   and the company s earnings payout ratio sits at 41  on a trailing 12 months basis 
This is a healthy payout ratio for just about any type of company and maintains a reasonable margin of safety for an economy sensitive business such as Union Pacific  Even if earnings were unexpectedly cut in half  Union Pacific s payout ratio would be under 85  
Over the last decade  Union Pacific s earnings payout ratio has generally remained between 20  and 30   highlighting the stability of its earnings and dividend growth  Even during the financial crisis we can see that Union Pacific s payout ratio only increased from 21  in 2008 to 29  in 2009 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
The company s free cash flow payout ratio has been a bit lumpier  underscoring the capital intensity of the business 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Another factor impacting dividend safety is how a business performed during the last economic shock  Union Pacific saw its sales fall by 21  during the last recession  However  its cost controls were exceptional 
Management was able to hold free cash flow per share nearly steady in fiscal year 2009 and contained the company s drop in earnings per share to just 17   As a result  Union Pacific was able to squeeze out a moderate dividend increase during the downturn 
Union Pacific s stock also returned  23  in 2008  which outperformed the S P 500 by 14   While cyclical companies score lower for Dividend Safety  Union Pacific fared reasonable well during the last recession  all things considered 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Free cash flow is one of the most important financial metrics to understand for successful dividend investing  Without free cash flow  a company cannot sustainably pay dividends  As seen below  Union Pacific has generated consistent free cash flow  While railroads require substantial capital to build and maintain  they throw off a lot of cash  As Union Pacific continues increasing prices and investing in more efficient operations  cash flow generation should remain strong to support the dividend 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Union Pacific has steadily improved its return on invested capital over the last decade  The company s stable returns in the mid teens suggest that it has an economic moat and enable it to compound its earnings faster than other lower returning businesses  A relatively high and stable return can also indicate that a company s dividend payment is of higher quality 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Reviewing a company s balance sheet is also essential to assess dividend safety  especially for macro sensitive stocks  Companies will always make interest and debt payments before paying a dividend 
Union Pacific s financial leverage looks reasonable  As seen below  the company could cover its entire net debt with cash on hand and just 1 6 years  worth of earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Union Pacific also maintains investment grade credit ratings Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Overall  Union Pacific appears to have one of the safest dividend payments in the market  The company has healthy payout ratios  generates predictable free cash flow  and has demonstrated an excellent ability to pullback on costs when times get tough Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Union Pacific has a Dividend Growth Score of 66  which suggests that its dividend growth potential is somewhat above average 
The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1998 and increased its dividend every year since 2007  Union Pacific appears set to join the Dividend Achievers Index in the next year 
The company increased its total declared dividends per share by 15  in 2015 and has compounded its dividend by 22  per year over its last 10 fiscal years 
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Despite the company s strong historical dividend growth  I expect dividend growth to moderate to a mid single digit rate over the near term because of the macro challenges facing the business ValuationShares of Union Pacific trade at a forward looking P E ratio of 17 3 and have a dividend yield of 2 5   which is higher than their five year average dividend yield of 2  
Over the long term  I believe Union Pacific s earnings can grow at a 6 8  annual rate  which is about half as fast as the company s earnings have grown over the last five years 
Freight demand should increase with population growth over time  and Union Pacific s business model employs a good amount of operating leverage to realize faster earnings growth 
Under these assumptions  the stock appears to offer annual total return potential of 9 11  per year  2 5  dividend yield plus 6 8  annual earnings growth  
The stock doesn t look like a bargain today  but it does appear to be reasonably priced considering its high business quality 
If commodity headwinds intensify and further pressure the business  Union Pacific s stock could become very attractively priced for new investment money ConclusionUnion Pacific is a durable company that is sensitive to economic growth and a number of different commodity markets 
While current macro conditions are far from ideal and could certainly get worse from here  no one knows   the long term outlook remains stable in my view 
Freight demand should continue to expand with population growth  and Union Pacific s railroads will likely remain an essential component of our country s supply chain for many years to come 
As long as we are not on the brink of another recession or a bigger bust in commodity markets  Union Pacific appears to be reasonably priced for long term dividend growth investors seeking exposure to industrial sensitive stocks  Its the type of company I like to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio ",2016-06-14,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unp:-high-dividend-growth-and-a-durable-moat-200135944,200135944
155646,377162,UNP,Panama Canal Expansion  What Awaits Railroad Stocks ,opinion,"The expanded 102 year old Panama Canal was officially inaugurated on Jun 26 after the completion of a 10 year long intensive project  The expansion project  which is worth more than  5 billion  will now let huge ships carrying upto 14 000 containers travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean through a set of new locks 
The COSCO Shipping Panama  a Chinese container ship  was the first one to cross the expanded canal amid much fanfare  Panama hosts a major chunk of global shipments and its main competitor is the Suez Canal  This expansion will also increase competition for railroad companies that had been benefitting with lower fuel prices Expansion Motive and InvestmentsThe Panama expansion project has primarily been focused on two aspects  First  an increase in the volume of containers which cross the canal by threefold thereby enabling massive ships to finally cross the stretch  Second  a reduction in the time taken by ships which sail from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean The expansion project is expected to open several other opportunities like increase in commodities trade with Asia  as well as transport of natural gas across the route  as ships sign up to use the expanded routes  Though most investors are hopeful of the canal contributing to growth in the current slumping shipment industry  some remain skeptical about the high expenses incurred In addition to investments in building the canal  a sizable amount has been spent by port owners to revamp their facilities to manage the arrival of the bigger ships and higher container volumes  The Port Authority of New York   New Jersey spent  6 billion  while Port Miami has undertaken projects worth  2 billion in this regard  However  besides the investments  the canal expansion is likely to reduce global maritime costs by  10 46 billion Transportation Sector Price Index
Impact on Western and Eastern Railroads The Panama Canal expansion is significant for investors interested in the railroad industry  The railroad stocks will be the most impacted by the expansion as freight volumes across various routes would change significantly  Interestingly  the expansion will have a contrasting effect on railroad services based on their operational location In terms of transport between the U S  West and East coasts  importers tend to prefer using large vessels for shipments as they can carry a higher number of containers and hence  are more cost effective  Historically  imports from Asia have followed the sea route upto the West Coast and then transported by road to the East Coast  However  given that now the Panama Canal can let large ships traverse through to the East Coast  railroads with sizable portions of West Coast railways traffic  such as BNSF Railways  a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa   and Union Pacific Corp    NYSE UNP    stand to be adversely impacted However  companies are not viewing the canal as a major threat  United Pacific recently cited certain factors that make it confident that its business would not be significantly impacted  The company noted that much bigger ships with 18 000 20 foot containers that land on the West Coast cannot traverse the Panama Canal yet 
This is because these shipments are limited by height of the Bayonne Bridge in New York and inability of East Coast ports to accommodate increasing container volumes  thereby keeping the West Coast railroad volumes intact  The company also said that given a higher proportion of cargo would be at sea due to longer travel period to reach East Coast  financially struggling shipment companies would have to buy more containers which would be tough for them On the other hand  companies operating on routes  which move cargo from the Midwest south to Gulf Coast  are poised to witness a boom in business due to higher exports from this region  Companies with traffic concentration from the East Coast ports such as Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC   and CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   are expected to highly benefit from the increase in volume 
A  by C H  Robinson and The Boston Consulting Group estimates that 10  of all cargo from Asia docks at the East Coast instead of the West Coast due to the canal expansion  Thus volumes managed by these companies are set to increase  Companies like Canadian National Railways Company   NYSE CNI   and Canadian Pacific Railway Litd    NYSE CP    which have operations on both coasts  could eventually see a rise in freight volumes ConclusionThe effect of the Panama Canal expansion depends on various factors such as improvement in the shipping industry  global macroeconomic positivity which could increase volume of exports and imports  and capacity management by ports and railroad companies  Though some companies are likely to suffer a setback based on traffic routes  an increase in volumes could benefit the overall sector ",2016-06-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/panama-canal-expansion:-what-awaits-railroad-stocks-200138812,200138812
155647,377163,UNP,Does An Expanded Panama Canal Pack A Heavy Enough Punch ,opinion,"For the past century  the Panama Canal has served as a bridge between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  but changes needed to be made to adapt for the next century  On June 26th  a newly expanded canal opened up  boasting a now doubled capacity for freight traffic and size 
With larger freight ships  the issue became that the canal was both too narrow and too shallow  issues that the expansion is meant to tackle  It will operate 24 hours a day  seven days a week  with a current expectation of 35 to 40 ships passing through every day  as per the  
The canal allows for expedited transport of commercial goods  ranging from automobiles to grain  Before  if a company on the West Coast in the U S  wanted to ship to the East Coast  the ship would have circumnavigated the entirety of South America and sailed back up North to its destination 
Although boosted capacity certainly has positive implications for Panama  a dampened reputation due to the Mossak Fonseca Panama Papers leak along with a need for more water in the channel are a few of many potential difficulties  Let s take a look at why the expansion matters  and how we can expect it to impact the rail shipping industry 
How Was the Canal Improved 
Canals use locks  a system meant to raise or lower watercraft between areas of water that may not necessarily be even  This is integral to canals  as their sole purpose is to allow for the quick and safe transit of watercraft 
The Panama Canal previously had a capacity of up to 5 000 TEUs  with the TEU  Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit  serving as the unit of capacity on a container ship  According to the  for the Panama Canal  the post expansion capacity is up to between 13 000 and 14 000 TEUs 
Each lock complex has three levels  and creates a new lane with a lock on each side  The website states that this  provides a capacity to handle vessels up to 49 meters  160 feet  wide  366 meters  1 200 feet  long and 15 meters  50 feet  deep  
The expansion is also meant to make the Panama Canal more competitive with Egypt s Suez Canal  which has the capacity to handle mega ships with a capacity of 14 501 TEU and higher  The Suez Canal is longer  has no locks and costs less than the Panama Canal  however both handle similar levels of traffic 
Benefits to Trade and Industry
  the Panama Canal expansion is significant for investors interested in the railroad industry  Normally  Asian exports are transported by ship to the West Coast  after which they are transported by train to the East Coast by such firms as BNSF  a subsection of Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa   and Union Pacific Corp   NYSE UNP   
Because the Panama Canal now has an expanded capacity  many of these larger ships will simply make use of the canal instead of railways to transport their goods  which stands to negatively impact the aforementioned firms that have heavy presence in the West Coast 
Although the canal negatively impacts some companies  this doesn t mean that the entire industry will be hurt by it  Companies such as Norfolk Southern Corp    NYSE NSC   and CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX   that move cargo to the Gulf Coast are in position to benefit from increased volume in the Panama Canal 
Expansion of the Panama Canal reduces the cost of imported goods while also creating increased access to Asian markets for U S  exporters  Because freight ships have significantly more capacity than trains  increased use of the canal will decrease shipping costs for many companies  being that ships are a slightly slower but cost effective method for transport 
Outlook Isn t Picture Perfect 
As the  points out  there are many concerns about the Panama Canal  One such concern involves the concrete that lines the walls of the locks  There have been past situations in which water broke through the concrete  The budget for concrete in the expansion was comparatively small  71  smaller than the next lowest bidder for the contract 
Another concern comes from tugboat captains  who say that the canal locks have too small a margin of error and could make navigation more challenging  This coupled with concerns about the depth of the waterway creates doubt about the reliability of the canal  Officials are hopeful that three water saving basins  which will reuse 60 percent of water in each transit  will help to reduce this strain 
Panama itself could potentially serve as somewhat of a liability  concerning it is a nation still shaking off the aftereffects of the Panama Papers scandal  which has decreased traffic in the region  Furthermore  its large earthquake risk could pose a threat down the road  The canal waterway also serves as tap water for the people of Panama  who will have to be aware of their usage so as not to overly diminish reserves 
Macroeconomic headwinds will also play a direct role in the utilization of the canal  A slower Chinese economy coupled with aftershocks of Brexit could potentially reduce export volumes  Competition with the Suez Canal  for which further expansion is also planned  also serves as a potential threat 
Bottom Line
The Panama Canal has served as a vital trade route for over a century now  but as the case with any longstanding structure  it has to keep up with the times  Its recent expansion is a direct response to increasing demand  and does have a lot of potential  However  as is the case with anything  it is not without its dangers and difficulties 
The challenges are only beginning  and whether or not the expansion will pay off is something that investors will have to watch as time goes on  The Panama Canal has a lot of economic firepower  but there s no way of knowing yet if it will have to surrender that in the near future ",2016-06-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-an-expanded-panama-canal-pack-a-heavy-enough-punch-200139056,200139056
155649,377165,UNP,Nucor  Zumiez  Berkshire Hathaway  Union Pacific And Norfolk Southern Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 30  2016    highlightsNucor Corp  NYSE NUE     as the Bull of the Day and  Zumiez    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa     and Union Pacific Corp  NYSE UNP       and Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC      

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

The construction sector is currently expected to see earnings growth  8 9  year over year in the second quarter of 2016  This expectation was further bolstered with the recent US construction report that stated overall growth is expected to average  6  annually into 2020 with expenditures totaling  1 5 trillion  Specifically  nonresidential building segment is expected to see annual growth of  7 7   and spending on nonresidential building construction is expected to rise an average  4 9  per year through 2020  One company that is highly leveraged to the nonresidential construction market  Nucor Corp     is our Zacks Bull of the Day 

This Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  company manufactures and sells steel products  Principal steel products are hot rolled steel  angles  rounds  flats  channels  sheet  wide flange beams  pilings  billets  blooms and beam blanks   cold rolled steel  cold finished steel  steel joists and joist girders  steel deck  steel fasteners and steel grinding balls  Nucor is the largest recycler in the United States  Nucor and affiliates are manufacturers of steel products  with operating facilities in fourteen states 

Earnings and Increased Second Quarter Guidance

Management reported Q1 16 earnings in late April where they beat the Zacks consensus revenue estimate  but came in below the Zacks consensus earnings estimate  The company saw year over year gains in net earnings  4 4   total tons shipped  9   total steel mill shipments  16   overall operating rates at the steel mills  74   and total steel mill energy costs declined  7 per ton compared to the year ago quarter 

Then in mid June management announced guidance for Q2 16 earnings  they expect earnings to be in a range of  0 65 to  0 70 per diluted share compared to Q2 15 earnings of  0 39 per diluted share  Management expects to see improvements in the steel mill segment and their downstream products segment 

Management s View

According to management   We expect earnings in the second quarter of 2016 to be significantly improved from the first quarter of 2016  Performance of the steel mills segment is expected to improve in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 as recently announced price increases for many of our products are being accepted in the market  This improved performance by the steel mills segment in the second quarter of 2016 will be tempered by rising scrap prices  We expect increased profitability for our downstream products segment in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to seasonal factors as improving weather conditions benefit nonresidential construction markets  The performance of the raw materials segment is expected to improve in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to improved pricing at both our scrap processing businesses and DRI facilities  

 

The traditional retail apparel segment continues to lose customers to online market giants like Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   Alibaba  NYSE BABA  com  and even Walmart  NYSE WMT  com  These online behemoths are dominating the market and squeezing out the more traditional brick and mortar stores  While these retail stores are building out their online presence  it looks to be too little too late  The online giants are eating into the profit margins of stores like Zumiez      who is the Zacks Bear of the Day 

This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is a leading specialty retailer of action sports related apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories  Their stores cater to young men and women between ages 12 24  focusing on skateboarding  surfing  snowboarding  motocross and BMX 

Q1 Earnings Below Expectations

In their most recent earnings report  the company posted year over year Q1  ending April 30  losses in net sales  2 6   comparable sales  7 5   and posted a net loss of  2 1 million after posting a net gain of  2 8 million in Q1 15  To add to the company s recent difficulties  management stated that May 2016 net sales fell  2 9   and the company s comparable sales fell  7 6  

Because of the less than expected sales numbers  management decreased Q2 16 guidance for comparable sales to a range from  6  to  8   which was below expectations of  2   Further  management guided down EPS for Q2 from an expected  0 06 to a range of   0 09 to   0 13 

According to Rick Brooks  CEO   While our monthly comparable sales trends improved as the quarter progressed  the quarter was more challenging than expected  We did experience pockets of strength within our merchandise assortments  however it wasn t enough to offset the general weakness in consumer demand for our major categories  During this period of instability for the retail industry  we are taking actions aimed at preserving near term profitability while continuing to make the necessary investments in the business to best position the company for future success  We remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to capitalize on the domestic and international growth opportunities that lie ahead and return greater value to our shareholders over the long term

Is an Expanded Panama Canal Enough 

For the past century  the Panama Canal has served as a bridge between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  but changes needed to be made to adapt for the next century  On June 26th  a newly expanded canal opened up  boasting a now doubled capacity for freight traffic and size 

With larger freight ships  the issue became that the canal was both too narrow and too shallow  issues that the expansion is meant to tackle  It will operate 24 hours a day  seven days a week  with a current expectation of 35 to 40 ships passing through every day  as per the  

The canal allows for expedited transport of commercial goods  ranging from automobiles to grain  Before  if a company on the West Coast in the U S  wanted to ship to the East Coast  the ship would have circumnavigated the entirety of South America and sailed back up North to its destination 

Although boosted capacity certainly has positive implications for Panama  a dampened reputation due to the Mossak Fonseca Panama Papers leak along with a need for more water in the channel are a few of many potential difficulties  Let s take a look at why the expansion matters  and how we can expect it to impact the rail shipping industry 

How Was the Canal Improved 

Canals use locks  a system meant to raise or lower watercraft between areas of water that may not necessarily be even  This is integral to canals  as their sole purpose is to allow for the quick and safe transit of watercraft 

The Panama Canal previously had a capacity of up to 5 000 TEUs  with the TEU  Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit  serving as the unit of capacity on a container ship  According to the  for the Panama Canal  the post expansion capacity is up to between 13 000 and 14 000 TEUs 

Each lock complex has three levels  and creates a new lane with a lock on each side  The website states that this  provides a capacity to handle vessels up to 49 meters  160 feet  wide  366 meters  1 200 feet  long and 15 meters  50 feet  deep  

The expansion is also meant to make the Panama Canal more competitive with Egypt s Suez Canal  which has the capacity to handle mega ships with a capacity of 14 501 TEU and higher  The Suez Canal is longer  has no locks and costs less than the Panama Canal  however both handle similar levels of traffic 

Benefits to Trade and Industry

   the Panama Canal expansion is significant for investors interested in the railroad industry  Normally  Asian exports are transported by ship to the West Coast  after which they are transported by train to the East Coast by such firms as BNSF  a subsection of Berkshire Hathaway Inc     and Union Pacific Corp     

Because the Panama Canal now has an expanded capacity  many of these larger ships will simply make use of the canal instead of railways to transport their goods  which stands to negatively impact the aforementioned firms that have heavy presence in the West Coast 

Although the canal negatively impacts some companies  this doesn t mean that the entire industry will be hurt by it  Companies such as Norfolk Southern Corp     that move cargo to the Gulf Coast are in position to benefit from increased volume in the Panama Canal 

Expansion of the Panama Canal reduces the cost of imported goods while also creating increased access to Asian markets for U S  exporters  Because freight ships have significantly more capacity than trains  increased use of the canal will decrease shipping costs for many companies  being that ships are a slightly slower but cost effective method for transport 

Outlook Isn t Picture Perfect

As the  points out  there are many concerns about the Panama Canal  One such concern involves the concrete that lines the walls of the locks  There have been past situations in which water broke through the concrete  The budget for concrete in the expansion was comparatively small  71  smaller than the next lowest bidder for the contract

The challenges are only beginning  and whether or not the expansion will pay off is something that investors will have to watch as time goes on  The Panama Canal has a lot of economic firepower  but there s no way of knowing yet if it will have to surrender that in the near future

155671,377187,UNP,The  Real Stuff  Economy Is Falling Apart,opinion,"Each month one or two high profile government reports show the US is growing  adding jobs and generally recovering from the Great Recession  But it s not clear how that can be  when the part of the economy that makes and moves real things keeps shrinking  Here s a chart  published recently by Zero Hedge  showing that US manufacturing has been contracting for the past year 

Meanwhile  the companies that move physical things around are falling hard 


Railroad stocks dropped sharply Wednesday  after both Kansas City Southern  N KSU  and CSX Corp  N CSX   provided downbeat outlooks for the current quarter at an analyst conference 
The sector s decline helped pull the Dow Jones Transportation Average  down 2 1   much more than the 0 9  decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  Kansas City Southern s stock was the biggest loser in the group  tumbling 7 1  on volume that was more than double the full day average  according to FactSet 

The company s chief financial officer  Michael Upchurch  said at the Credit Suisse  VX CSGN  industrials conference in Florida  that fourth quarter revenue would decline in the  high single digit  percentage range from year ago levels  according to a transcript provided by FactSet 
Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting  on average  fourth quarter revenue of  622 million  which implies a 3 3  decline 
CSX slumped 3 7  in active trade  after CFO Frank Lonegro said at the same conference that domestic coal movements have declined  more significantly in the fourth quarter than expected   As a result  he said earnings per share growth is now expected to be about 3   The company had said in October that it expected full year EPS growth in the  mid single digits  
Among the more active shares of other railroad companies  Union Pacific Corp  N UNP  slid 2 8  and Norfolk Southern Corp  N NSC  shed 2 8  

One reason for the discrepancy between overall growth and real stuff is that most of today s economy is made up of services  and they re doing okay  chart from   

What is the service sector  Mostly software  restaurants  banks  construction companies  retailers  doctors and hospitals 
Can an economy thrive if it doesn t make or move physical things  Intuitively the answer is no  because most of the services mentioned above either maintain the status quo  like healthcare and restaurants  or  like houses  consume rather than build capital  As for banking  in its current incarnation it s almost certainly a net negative  draining capital from productive uses and funneling it to trading desks and political action committees 
The US  in short  is engaged in an experiment to see how long an economy can function with services growing and manufacturing contracting  As with so many of today s monetary and fiscal experiments  no one knows when definitive results will come in  But the data so far aren t encouraging ",2015-12-04,John Rubino,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-“real-stuff”-economy-is-falling-apart-374142,374142
155672,377188,UNP,1 Top Dividend Stock For 2016,opinion,"Transports Are Back in the Next Leg of This Bull Market
Any way you slice it  Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE N UNP  has got to be on your watch list 
It doesn t matter how boring a railroad operation might be to you what a railroad reports is material intelligence for the domestic economy and the stock market 
The fact of the matter is the right railroad stock has proven to be a worthy addition to a long term  investment grade portfolio 
Not surprisingly  Warren Buffett bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe outright  Not only did he make billions on the surge in oil railcar transportation  rail and intermodal rail freight has always been a good business to be in 
Two of the best railroad companies in North America are Union Pacific and Canadian National Railway  USA   NYSE CNI   The largest single shareholder in CNI stock is Bill Gates 
And you just can t go wrong following the weekly  monthly  and annual rail traffic data provided by the Association of American Railroads  which covers the North American wide industry  These numbers are extremely useful as an investor 
As is typically the case in new bull markets  transportation stocks surge  which they did  Railroad stocks  especially Union Pacific  accelerated tremendously at the beginning of 2013  when I believe the current bull market began  
The position moved strongly higher  right up until the beginning of 2015  Then  along with the continuing decline in coals shipments among other freight  the position retrenched 
Union Pacific s stock chart is featured below

But this doesn t mean that the story is over  Transportation stocks live and breath on oil prices  best example  airlines  
As we know  the prices of gasoline  diesel  and jet fuel are down  not necessarily the surcharges to customers  though    This means that it s much easier for a railroad company to keep shareholders happy  even when freight volumes decline 
Look  rail freight is a cyclical business  But it s also a profitable one and Union Pacific  which currently yields just less than three percent  is not expensively priced on the stock market 
Fourth quarter 2015 freight volumes  or revenue carloads  for Union Pacific stock declined nine percent comparatively  producing a 15  decline in total quarterly operating revenues to  5 2 billion 
The company s quarterly average diesel fuel price in the fourth quarter was  1 61 per gallon  or 39  lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 
Once again  Union Pacific s biggest freight revenue decline was in coal shipments 
The Bottom Line on Union Pacific Stock
Union Pacific has a great track record in increasing dividend payments to stockholders  In the fourth quarter of 2015  the company repurchased 6 6 million of its own common shares for  586 million 
But it s useful to consider that the stock market is a forward looking pricing mechanism and Merrill Lynch sees many of the transportation stocks  including Union Pacific  as attractive now that they ve corrected  UNP stock is due for some near term upside 
This position is not expensively priced with an attractive yield 
What s important with Union Pacific stock is to keep it on your radar  Railroad companies like Union Pacific are like canaries in a coalmine  rail freight data over the next quarter or two will reveal whether or not the U S  economy will soon experience a recession ",2016-02-25,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/union-pacific-corporation:-1-top-dividend-stock-for-2016-200119484,200119484

155696,377212,UNP,3 Shipping Stocks Set For Smooth Sailing At The End Of Q1,opinion,With the first quarter 2015 earnings season in its last leg  the transportation sector has emerged as a credible performer  Stocks in the sector have benefited largely from weak oil prices and an improving U S  economy  However  a strong US dollar has dampened the results to some extent as well  Even though most transportation companies have already revealed their first quarter numbers  few are yet to report  Of these  most companies belong to the shipping space Plunging Oil Prices  A Boon for Shipping Stocks  Shipping companies are also enjoying the fruits of plunging oil prices  The slump in crude is expected to significantly reduce costs of bunker fuel prices  Despite the recent rally  crude prices have been hovering around the  55 a barrel mark  This represents a significant decline from the approximately  105 per barrel witnessed in July last year  In fact  oil prices have been fluctuating lately after hitting a 6 year low of under  44 in Mar 2015  The weak oil prices suit tankers marvelously  By the end of last year  earnings of very large crude carriers  VLCC  were close to a level of  100 000 a day  Their average rates through 2014 were also the best in nearly four years  Low oil prices will boost demand for tankers  which in turn should result in higher rates for shipping companies  We note that weak oil prices have benefited the transportation sector in general  This is because costs associated with oil form one of the major input costs for any transportation company  Key players in the airline space like Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  have reported higher than expected earnings in the first quarter aided by low fuel costs Railroads  The Weak Link With the bulk of the transportation companies having already reported their first quarter financial numbers  the results of U S  based railroad operators have emerged relatively soft  as compared to the impressive performances delivered by truckers  logistics providers and airline companies  Key railroad operators like Kansas City Southern  NYSE KSU  and Union Pacific  NYSE UNP  have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings as well as revenues  Poised slightly better  CSX Corp  NYSE CSX  and Norfolk Southern Corp  NYSE NSC  reported in line earnings but missed the mark for revenues  Railroad results were particularly hurt by weak coal shipments How to Pick the Winners  In view of the high degree of diversity in the transportation space  it is by no means an easy task to shortlist stocks that have the potential to outperform on the earnings front  Here our proprietary methodology comes in handy  It advises investors to look for stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   An earnings beat more often than not boosts investor confidence in the stocks  which translates into rapid price appreciation 3 Shipping Outperformers With the aid of the above methodology  we hereby present three shipping stocks that are expected to outshine earnings estimates in their upcoming releases Teekay Tankers Ltd  NYSE TNK  Based in Hamilton  Bermuda  this Zacks Rank  1 shipping stock currently has an earnings ESP of  43 33   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2015 earnings is pegged at 30 cents  The company has a decent track record with respect to earnings   it has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters  with a four quarter average beat of 25 56   The company will report its first quarter results on May 14  before the commencement of trading Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd  NYSE TNP   Headquartered in Athens  Greece  this Zacks Rank  2 company is a leading provider of international seaborne crude oil and petroleum product transportation services  The company offers marine transportation services to national  major  and other independent oil companies and refiners under long  medium  and short term charters  For the first quarter of 2015  Tsakos Energy currently has an earnings ESP of  17 65   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 34 cents  reflecting impressive year over year growth of 79 7   Tsakos Energy too has a healthy track record with respect to earnings   it has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters  with a four quarter average beat of 51 30   The company is expected to report its first quarter results on May 15 Frontline Ltd  NYSE FRO   Based in Hamilton  Bermuda  this Zacks Rank  3 provider of seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products currently has an earnings ESP of  350   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2015 earnings is pegged at 4 cents  The company is expected to report its first quarter results on May 26 ,2015-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-shipping-stocks-set-for-smooth-sailing-at-the-end-of-q1-251151,251151
155697,377213,UNP,Buffett Indicator Soars,opinion,"The Buffett indicator  which compares Corporate equities to GDP is now hitting the second highest level in the past 50 years  This indicator is around 15  above 2007 levels and around 16  below levels reached in 2000 
Speaking of Buffett  have you looked at Berkshire  NYSE BRKa  stock of late  Below looks at Berkshire Class A stock since the late 1990 s 

Berkshire of late hit a resistance line that dates back to the 1998  which appears to have stopped its upward progress  As it was hitting this resistance line  weekly momentum was hitting levels rarely reached in the past 25 years  In the short term BRK A is edging below support that has been in play since 2011 
So what does it mean that the Buffett indicator is so high  From a big picture perspective  no long lasting bull market has ever started from these levels  On the flip side it does not mean that the current bull market has to end  as the trend is up at this time

Highlights

Earnings growth from operating margin improvements as well as one time items 

The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 



Gross Margin Trend

Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors  Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital  If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital  it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop up using the balance sheet 



NSC US s improvement in gross margins have been accompanied by a deterioration in the management of working capital  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the improvements in gross margins are likely accounting trade offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions  Its working capital days have risen to 30 57 days from last year s levels of 14 72 days

Above upper BB there are often only two choices  digestion or reversal  But rarely is it the place for new entries  Market pulled back and had major follow through today  We like to focus on IWM here because it s been the clear leader  The first short term support coming up is the trend line near 122 

We would like to emphasize  short term   as you can see on weekly  it s not really that important for longer term trend  but if bulls want to keep recent momo alive  that s what they have to defend 

Along with the trend line also keep an eye on PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ 104 5 105   that was our first support test   and we said we would buy the first test  This would now be considered the second test  If that goes  roughly equivalent to SPY 204  then things can get murky fast 

Another good tell to keep an eye on is the tranny index  ARCA IYT   The whole sector is on support right now   watch to see if bulls can keep things alive here next few days   NYSE UNP   NYSE FDX    NYSE CSX  all good for the watch list  Volatility coming back   watch these major  tell  lines for clues on how serious bears are about this pullback

There s not anything to trade on with safety  Cash to me is the best position  but that doesn t mean it really is  If you individually can find trades that make sense I wouldn t blame you one bit for going in to that trade  whether it be long or short  Just keep stops tight enough  Don t do what I did with Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP  thinking a great company can t sell too hard  It can and does  Don t be me  Keep those stops appropriate  So for now we re nowhere  The bears have done nothing significant  but cause a minor pullback  which has the market flat for the year  Technically they ve done nothing to turn things bearish  No gaps lower either  Just nothing from nothing overall  We re in no man s land for now  No fun  but it is what it is 
If we break down the market more from sector to sector and even stock to stock there are some bearish signs  but nothing definitive  yet  since this has happened before only to see miraculous recoveries out of the blue  Many leaders throughout the market world in varying sectors have broken down through 20  and 50 day exponential moving averages only to back test  but then fail and head back down  That s becoming more normal than we ve seen in many months if not years  Somehow the market still hasn t broken  yet  but we are seeing more of that from individual stocks  If that trend continues maybe  just maybe the bears will celebrate down the road  I wouldn t hold my breath  They haven t celebrated in so long they may have forgotten how 
We are seeing more and more bad earnings reports and more and more poor economic reports  The market finds a way around it by saying it s the weather  Why not  Everyone blames the weatherman  Why should that be any exception for the stock market  We saw some bad  pre report warnings this week  but none worse than the one we heard from semiconductor leader SanDisk Corporation  NASDAQ SNDK   The stock was taken apart  and that s the problem with individual stocks for the moment  No one knows when an unexpected announcement will take place from any individual stock  making it easier on the soul  if you have to buy  to buy ETF s  At least there s a measure of safety about how much you can lose 
S P 500  or the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF  DIA   or the PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   seem to me to be the best way to be long if you must own something  or the itch to be in overwhelms you  With the economy clearly on the decline  weather related  or not  it seems the risk has moved up the ladder once again  Be careful what you get involved with  If you do own stocks  try to get one that has already reported and said things were fine  Also  avoiding froth stocks seems best  not because of their overall health  but because if a froth stock warns  you better look out below  No mercy on anything that s frothy and says things are deteriorating  This is a very risky environment  and  thus  you should treat it that way  Nothing is safe  Nothing is bearish either at this point in time  Go slow and be smart  Keep those stops tight ",2015-03-29,Jack Steiman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nothing-from-nothing....-headaches-still-out...-bears-still-not-getting-246546,246546
155753,377269,UNP,Finding Opportunities Beyond Direct Shale Plays,opinion,Total U S  crude oil production averaged an estimated 8 6 million barrels per day in August  the highest monthly production since July 1986  according to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   In our   we highlight that just a few years ago investors were contemplating the supply constraints facing the petroleum industry  but with the disruptive technology in shale oil and gas in the U S   we could now be looking at decades of drilling ahead  To make the most out of this energy boom  I like to remind investors to look beyond direct shale plays to find opportunities  One way of doing so is to become aware of the companies that provide key ingredients or supplies used in the process of hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  One key ingredient is sand  According to the   due to the enormous increase in the demand for sand  PacWest Consulting Partners expects frackers to use nearly 95 billion pounds of sand this year  up 30 percent since 2013  This projection  made by the energy consulting firm just one year ago  is a 50 percent increase to its original estimate  Since many energy companies have adopted the process of fracking in their oil field operations  they have come to rely on sand as an integral component to this procedure  In fracking  sand can be used as a  proppant   Once the shale rock formations are injected with water and chemicals  it is the proppant  normally treated sand  that keeps the newly formed cracks open after they are made in the rock  This allows the natural gas or crude oil to be extracted more easily  A recent article from Shale Plays Media highlights that just a year ago oil field fracking operations used around 2 500 tons of sand  whereas today the new fracking techniques call for as much as 8 000 tons of sand to be pumped into a well   That s 75 to 100 railcars of sand per well   The article goes on to explain that this  frac sand  is normally high purity quartz that can withstand between 6 000 and 14 000 pounds of pressure per square inch  Who is supplying the sand  Knowing the incredible value of sand to the oil drilling industry makes it easier for us to identify meaningful opportunities for our funds  For example  we want to know who is supplying the sand and who is moving the sand to and from the drill sites   these are the companies to pay attention to  One company we have identified as a sand success story is Emerge Energy Services  This company deals directly with the production and supply of sand to drill sites  Since debuting in May 2013  the company has seen its share price go from  17 to  122 50 at the end of August  Sand production companies like Emerge have shifted focus from solely supplying sand for roofing  construction  glassware and golf course projects  over to the enormous demand needed for oil and gas drilling across the United States  The outlook for the energy sector remains strong as we look towards 2015  with the demand for sand showing no signs of a slowdown  Who is shipping the sand  Besides sand production companies  railroads throughout North America are another beneficiary of the booming energy industry  and not only because of oil shipments  The rail industry is now busier than ever hauling frac sand across the numerous shale plays  Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP  is an example of one rail company that has seen a 26 percent increase in hauled railcar loads of sand since 2013  According to the company website  the rail line covers 23 states in the Western two thirds of the U S  There is more than one way to make the most out of the energy renaissance we are living through  Emerge Energy and Union Pacific are two companies we have invested in  Witnessing the adoption of the fracking process fuel demand for frac sand is just one example  I encourage investors to stay curious  ask questions and dig deeper to find all the opportunities that may be right

155754,377270,UNP,Is It The Right Time To Add Railroad Stocks To Your Portfolio ,opinion,"The railroad industry is poised for strong growth in the coming quarters  reflecting the industry s leverage to the positive momentum in the U S  economy  The strong earnings performance we saw from the industry in the third quarter earnings season should sustain itself in the current and coming quarters as well  Stocks of railroad operators did extremely well in 2014  but the momentum should continue into the New Year as well 
We are discussing key factors of the railroad sector that investors should consider and look forward to in the coming months Rail Investments Investments in development and expansion plans remain crucial when analyzing the prospects for the railroad industry  These capital investments are a union of binaries  While the investments put significant stress on margin performance  forgoing these would dampen growth prospects  Railway investments are significant  given the evolving supply chain management and the growing importance of airfreight carriers in offering freight transportation services  These investments help railways in getting the required infrastructure to compete effectively in the railroad industry and with other modes of transport like truck  barges and cargo airlines  Hence  investments in infrastructural projects have been an integral part of the development of railroads  However  this sector  characterized by huge capital influx  has been drawing funds primarily through private financing  As a result  investment plans can have a considerable impact on the company s liquidity position and could lead to a highly leveraged balance sheet  According to Association of American Railroads  AAR   reports  railroads invest approximately 17  of their annual revenue  which compares with only 3  of average U S  manufactures  revenues on capital expenditures  According to Department of Transportation  DOT   the demand for rail freight transportation will increase approximately 88  by 2035  As a result  Class I carriers would have to increase their investments to meet this growing demand  It is estimated that railroads would require  149 billion to improve rail network infrastructure within this stipulated period  Given the growing demand and need to upgrade railroad infrastructure to meet new regulations  deployment of fuel efficient locomotives  upcoming rules on track sharing  railroad safety and high speed rail services are demanding that railroad companies infuse more capital in development projects  According to DOT  almost 90  of the railway capacity needs to be upgraded to meet the expected rise in demand level by 2035  Hence  it is important for railroad companies to balance profitability levels while investing in infrastructural development projects 
Currently  the U S  railroad industry dominates less than 50  of total freight in America  indicating a huge opportunity for increasing market share  This opportunity can only be exploited by building railroad infrastructure that caters to the varied requirements of shippers Discretionary Pricing Power  The freight railroad operators function in a seller s market and have enjoyed pricing power since 1980  when the U S  government adopted the Staggers Rail Act  The idea was to allow rail transporters to hike prices on captive shippers like electric utilities  chemical and agricultural companies in order to improve profitability of the struggling railroad industry  As a result of the Staggers Rail Act  railroad companies are hiking their freight rates by nearly 5  per annum on an average  while maintaining a double digit profit margin Duopolistic Market Structures  Railroad companies have  by and large  gained by practicing discretionary pricing in the freight market  In the prevailing duopolistic rail industry  railroad operators will be able to reap maximum benefits from rising prices when the overall demand grows 
This remains evident from the geographic distribution of markets between major railroads  Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe control the western part of the U S   while CSX Corp   CSX  and Norfolk Southern Corp   NSC  control the eastern part  On the other hand  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   NYSE CP  and Canadian National control inter country rail shipment between the U S  and Canada Crude by Rail  Emerging Opportunity Despite the recent drop in oil prices  transportation of oil remains a lucrative opportunity for railroad operators  A lot will depend on how long oil prices remain low  but as long as production volumes don t come down materially in the near to medium term  railroad volumes should largely hold up as well  Rail based crude transportation is no doubt more expensive compared to other means like pipelines  But shipper don t have much alternatives to using railroads given the lack of pipeline infrastructural support in key producing basins like the Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota and Montana  the Eagle Ford Shale  Barnett Shale and Permian Basin in Texas  the Gulf of Mexico and Alberta oil sand fields  According to AAR  U S  crude oil production is expected to grow in 2015 despite lower crude oil prices  While drilling activities are expected to suffer due to poor pricing and less favorable economic factors  oilfield operators will continue to pump from existing producing facilities  In the long run  however  volumes will suffer if oil prices remain depressed for an extended period  U S  crude oil production will increase an estimated production of 9 3 million barrels per day by 2015  up from 2014 levels  This surge represents an opportunity for revenue accretion  which the railroads are trying to achieve with infrastructural development  As a result  inadequate pipeline developments have given rise to higher penetration of railroad transportation for crude oil shipping in Canada  According to AAR s article  Moving Crude Oil by Rail   railroads transported over 60  of North Dakota s crude oil production  which contains the vast majority of new rail crude oil originations  Further  in terms of safety  railroads offer a better transportation avenue compared to pipeline due to its better spill rate profile  According to DOT  spill rate for pipelines are three times higher than rail  based on crude shipments between 2002 and 2012  Additionally  railroad companies are working toward tightening rail safety measures by appealing to federal regulators to phase out old tank cars if these are not upgraded  They are also seeking improved standards for new tank cars Bottom Line There are various factors that reinstate hope for investors interested in the railroad industry  A company in this industry that investors should keep an eye on is Union Pacific Corp   UNP  with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company s earnings over the past 10 years have significantly risen and has consistently reported top line growth  Amid macroeconomic volatility and subdued demand  Union Pacific managed to deliver 7  revenue growth in 2013 ",2014-12-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-it-the-right-time-to-add-railroad-stocks-to-your-portfolio-237003,237003

The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 

Market Share Versus Profits
Companies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth 

Compared to the same quarter last year  UNP s change in revenue trailed its change in earnings  which was 21 89   The company s performance this period suggests a focus on boosting bottom line earnings  While the revenue performance could be better  it is important to note that this quarterly change in revenue was among the highest in the peer group thus far  Also  for comparison purposes  revenue changed by  0 47  and earnings by 4 45  compared to the immediate last quarter 

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company s earnings growth was influenced by year on year improvement in gross margins from 46 52  to 50 22  as well as better cost controls  As a result  operating margins  EBITDA margins  rose from 43 18  to 46 51  compared to the same period last year  For comparison  gross margins were 49 39  and EBITDA margins were 45 47  in the quarter ending September 30  2014 

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors  Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital  If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital  it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop up using the balance sheet 

UNP s improvement in gross margins have been accompanied by a deterioration in the management of working capital  This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the improvements in gross margins are likely accounting trade offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions  Its working capital days have risen to 14 01 days from last year s levels of 4 91 days 

Cash Versus Earnings   Sustainable Performance 

UNP s year on year change in operating cash flow of 4 38  trailed its change in earnings  This leads Capital Cube to question whether the earnings number might have been achieved from some unlocking of accruals  In addition  the increase in operating cash flow was less than the average announced thus far by its peer group 

Margins
The company s earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors   1  Improvements in operating  EBIT  margins from 35 04  to 38 57  and  2  one time items  The company s pretax margins are now 37 35  compared to 33 45  for the same period last year 

EPS Growth Versus Earnings Growth
UNP s change in Earnings per Share  EPS  of 26 27  compared to the same quarter last year is better than its change in earnings of 21 89   At the same time  this change in earnings is less than the peer average among the results announced by its peer group  suggesting that the company is losing ground in generating profits from its competitors

The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth 

Market Share Versus Profits
Companies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth 

KSU s change in revenue compared to the same period last year of 4 37  lagged its change in earnings which was 23 90   The company s performance this period suggests an effort to boost profitability  While this is good to a point  the fact that the company s revenue performance is lower than the average of the results announced to date by its peers does not bode well from a long term market share perspective  Also  for comparison purposes  revenues changed by  5 17  and earnings by 2 10  compared to the immediate last quarter 

Earnings Growth Analysis
The company s earnings growth was influenced by year on year improvement in gross margins from 41 33  to 43 77  as well as better cost controls  As a result  operating margins  EBITDA margins  rose from 41 33  to 43 77  compared to the same period last year  For comparison  gross margins were 43 45  and EBITDA margins were 43 45  in the quarter ending September 30  2014 

Gross Margin Trend
Companies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors  Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital  If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital  it is possible that the company s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop up using the balance sheet 

KSU s improvement in gross margin has been accompanied by an improvement in its balance sheet as well  This suggests that gross margin improvements are likely from operating decisions and not accounting gimmicks  Its working capital days have declined to 2 75 days from 27 69 days for the same period last year 

Cash Versus Earnings   Sustainable Performance 

Margins
The expansion in operating  EBIT  margins from 31 86  to 33 29  has also impacted the company s earnings growth  However  one time items have been a drag on the operating performance  As a result  the company s pretax margins contracted from 29 39  to 26 49  

EPS Growth Versus Earnings Growth
KSU s change in Earnings per Share  EPS  of 24 27  compared to the same quarter last year is better than its change in earnings of 23 90   At the same time  this change in earnings is less than the peer average among the results announced by its peer group  suggesting that the company is losing ground in generating profits from its competitors

155776,377292,UNP,The Engines That Could  All Aboard ,opinion,"The transports have been a powerful force over the last 6 months  continuing to make new highs  And within the sector the railroads are chugging along as they move higher  One  Union Pacific  NYSE UNP   is carrying the fleet higher  blazing a new trail  But there are two railroads that are sitting on the edge of a break out  Kansas City Southern   NYSE KSU  and Norfolk Southern   NYSE NSC   They might just need some confidence to break higher  Come everyone  chant it with me   I think I can  I think I can   

Kansas City Southern gapped lower in January and made a double bottom in February  Since then it has been tightening against the resistance between 104 25 and 106  A break higher would look for a gap fill above 116  The momentum indicators RSI and MACD both support a move higher as well 

Norfolk Southern has not had a set back  but just a steady move higher that has turned into a consolidation between 93 and 98 since the beginning of March  Pressing on the top of the range again form a higher low  it has support to break through from a rising RSI and MACD  Both are bullish as well  This little engine could move  5 on the break higher

155777,377293,UNP,UNP  Buybacks  Dividends  Stock Splits   Business Is Getting Better,opinion,"There are a lot of stocks bouncing off their all time record highs and Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP  is one of them 
Not surprisingly  the company just announced a two for one stock split with the stock dividend  effective June 6  2014 to shareholders of record on May 27  2014  The last time Union Pacific split its shares was in May of 2008  also effecting a two for one stock split 
Management also announced the second installment of its new  0 91 per share quarterly dividend  The previous dividend amount was  0 79 a share 
Only four years ago  the company s dividend was  0 33 a share  illustrating just how good an investment this railroad has been 
And business is getting better  Union Pacific plans to spend  4 1 billion in total capital expenditures this year  The company recently boosted this figure by  150 million  saying that it needs to purchase 29 more locomotives than it previously estimated 
In October of last year  this stock was trading for  150 00 a share  It just bounced off an all time record high of  196 16  Despite being cut in half during the 2008 2009 financial crisis  this stock s been going up since the beginning of 2005  which is an excellent track record 
The company s stock chart is featured below 

Union Pacific is a great benchmark company that s worth checking in on once every quarter  even if you aren t interested in being a shareholder  The reason for this is because this railroad operator is its own leading indicator on the U S  economy 
Railroads are reactionary enterprises  If they need more cars  they put them on  if they need more locomotives  they buy them  That  in itself  is a positive gauge regarding the markets they serve 
By group  the two largest revenue generators for the company are industrial products and intermodal  This is followed by shipments of coal  agricultural products  chemicals  and automotives 
The first quarter of 2014 saw strong comparable growth in the shipment of industrial products and agricultural products  Grain shipments rose 39  in the first quarter  Due to the impact of the severe drought in 2012  2013 first quarter grain shipments were abnormally low  thereby resulting in the big percentage gain 
Within the industrial products category was strong quarterly growth in the shipment of non metallic minerals  which translates to sand used for fracking  The company also experienced meaningful growth in the shipment of construction related materials 
In the railroad business  a company s operating ratio is the big industry metric  This is a company s operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenues  Union Pacific s operating ratio improved two points to a first quarter record of 67 1  
At the beginning of this year  the company initiated a new buyback program authorizing the purchase of 60 million of its own shares by the end of 2017  In the first quarter  it bought 3 82 million of its own shares  which is very close to two full days of average trading volume  
Union Pacific reports its next set of quarterly results on July 24  That will be an earnings report worth reading  Subsequent to this is the company s SEC form 10K filing  which is really worth reading  This form provides a much more detailed breakdown of what s happening within this business and big parts of the U S  economy  too 
Union Pacific is still very much a growing enterprise and the company s rising prices for freight have so far not affected demand  Union Pacific is a great benchmark stock and a worthwhile old economy play that s got more legs in this market  Even if you re not interested in investing in a solid railroad stock like Union Pacific  it s a company worth adding to your watch list if only to better shape your market view

155778,377294,UNP,Bull Market Won t Break Till Transports Head Lower,opinion,"The Dow Jones Transportation Average keeps powering ahead  and the rest of the stock market is very close behind it 
The strong performance of this index is confirmation of further Dow theory gains  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been fighting its way higher since May 20 
Some of the performances of transportation stocks have been truly spectacular and very much a reflection of a bull market 
Alaska Air Group  Inc   NYSE ALK  just bounced off  100 00 a share  It was  50 00 a share late June last year 
Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP   which has been one of my favorite benchmark stocks for gauging industrial economic activity and the stock market  is right around  200 00 a share   See here  
UNP was  150 00 a year ago  which is a very good capital gain for such a mature large cap enterprise 
And Southwest Airlines Co   NYSE LUV  just hit an all time record high  about double what it was trading at this time last year 
The Dow Jones Transportation Average is old economy  but it is a very meaningful gauge for the rest of the stock market  I advise all investors to follow the index on a frequent basis  The broader market is highly unlikely to break down without a commensurate move in transportation stocks 
The NASDAQ Composite and Russell 2000 can certainly be more volatile  but generally speaking  so long as the Dow Jones Transportation Average is holding up  so will the rest of the market 
Since the financial crisis  big corporations have been very unwilling to invest in new operations  But what offers a glimmer of hope in big corporate investment is the merger and acquisition activity  The increased activity is a reflection that big companies are starting to consider more risk and also that sentiment among management is improving 
In many cases  growth through acquisition is cheaper and more accretive to earnings than developing new businesses from the ground up  Of course  growth through acquisition is all about  synergies   which translates into average expense reduction  But that is the corporate game and shareholders typically are the beneficiaries 
Getting back to transportation stocks  most of the stocks that compose the Dow Jones index have come back after the sell off at the beginning of the year  Even FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  and United Parcel Service  Inc   NYSE UPS  have broken out of their recent consolidations and appear to be poised for new highs 
This is still a market without much conviction  and perhaps that s the case because the Main Street economic performance is not growing at the same rate as a lot of stocks 
Strength in transportation stocks is a classic bull market indicator  But I don t view the bull market as beginning at the March 2009 low  but rather  the beginning of 2013  as stocks broke out to the upside with significant conviction from the previous recovery market and cycle 
Regardless of where we re at and what it s called  strength in the transportation sector is a very positive signal 
There s some catching up to be done by other indices  but it s all possible in what is still an environment favorable to equities

Overall  Union Pacific  Kansas City Southern  and GATX appear poised for strength this summer as the economy freight and passenger traffic re accelerates  In addition to stronger demand from freight and passenger traffic  the railroads look as though they will continue to benefit from the long term shift towards the use of rail  Rail companies are also signaling their belief in their long term outlook  with continued strong investment in infrastructure  Lastly  these rail companies may also benefit from stronger growth in the Western United States  as evidenced by their ability to outperform analysts  earnings estimates on a fairly regular basis ",2014-06-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-railroad-stocks-with-plenty-of-steam-to-go-higher-this-year-216279,216279
155782,377298,UNP,Is This Stock A Benchmark For The Entire Market ,opinion,"Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP  is a company that s getting upgraded by the Street and earnings estimates are ticking higher  It s great news for this benchmark stock and top wealth creator 
The business cycle in old economy industrial businesses still has legs  and while Union Pacific s share price is up some 25 points over the last 12 months  I think this stock can keep ticking higher into 2015 
The railroad business has proven to be a good one over the last several years  Most railroad companies have been able to increase their prices for freight without affecting demand  and that s a very important metric and telling indicator 
Union Pacific s share price was around  26 a share this time in 2009  Now it s just over  100    the company recently effected a two for one stock split    and the has increased its dividends paid seven times since 2009  It s in is a good business and it continues to pay as a stock market investment 
Growth
The company s volume growth is coming from both agricultural and industrial products  And even its coal transportation business is showing improvement 
Union Pacific is moving a lot of freight cars related to the domestic oil business  While many might see this as carloads of crude  the company actually ships more carloads of fracturing sand than oil  It s a growth area for the business  and it has been for several years 
The company s one year stock chart is featured below 

Chart courtesy of 
This is a stock that has proven to be a worthy buy when it s down  It hasn t been down for long  and it remains a favorite among institutional investors  especially those wanting exposure to the transportation industry 
Multiple Themes
Not all transportation stocks or railroads are doing as well as the indices  But Union Pacific remains a top performer and while the company may not garner a lot of enthusiasm among young individual investors pining for technology  this is a great play representing multiple investment themes 
Some of these themes include a way to play the revival  albeit modest  in the industrial economy and some specific areas of manufacturing  like automakers  The company is a play on agriculture  construction materials  resources  like coal  oil  and metals   and trucking freight through intermodal 
Another Play
I believe that one railroad stock has a very useful role to play in any equity market portfolio and Union Pacific may just be my choice  Canadian National Railway Company  NYSE CNI  is another railroad company to consider with multinational exposure 
There will come a time when railroad stocks will be less favored by institutional investors  but it s not now 
Union Pacific has done an outstanding job creating wealth for shareholders through its capital appreciation on the stock market  increasing dividends  and strong share repurchase program 
It s a good time to be in the railroad business  and this company should continue to grow its business as the next cycle develops over the next few years 
While favoring this company specifically compared to its peer group  I still like this stock on any major price retrenchments ",2014-06-24,Mitchell Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-this-stock-a-benchmark-for-the-entire-market-217221,217221

It s a good time to be in railroad stocks  and if you believe that the economy is ready to experience a new business cycle like I do  then these stocks have a lot more legs in this market 
I still like Union Pacific and Canadian National Railway Company  NYSE CNI  both for capital gains potential and income for investors 
The railroad business isn t complicated  If there is demand for the shipment of freight  railroad companies add railcars  Accordingly  a company that manufactures railcars and other related products is likely doing pretty well considering how strong railroad stocks have performed over the last several years 
The Greenbrier Companies  Inc   NYSE GBX   is a company we ve looked at before  This business is headquartered in Lake Oswego  Oregon and business conditions are pretty good 
The company manufactures railcars for the North American market as well as Europe  But it s not just a pure play railcar supplier  the company makes barges for marine transportation and also sells specialized industrial fabrication for electrical  construction  and energy customers 
A lot of stocks related to the transportation freight railroad industry are doing great  The Greenbrier Companies is riding a wave of new manufacturing demand  and the stock just hit a new all time record high after reporting another great quarter  
According to the company  its bottom line earnings for its third fiscal quarter of 2014  ended May 31  doubled to  33 6 million  or  1 03 per share  compared to the same fiscal quarter last year 
The company s revenues were up 18  comparatively to  593 million and management reported that all three of its principle businesses improved their financial performance comparatively 
Of note in the company s recent earnings report was its railcar order backlog  which is currently around 26 400 units  representing about  2 75 billion in total 
The backlog is way up from the previous quarter  ended February 28  2014  of 15 200 railcar units worth approximately  1 54 billion 
This position is closing in around  70 00 a share  It was  22 00 one year ago 
I believe the price momentum with these kinds of stocks is sustainable and that The Greenbrier Companies  along with Union Pacific and Canadian National Railway  will keep ticking higher in the absence of a stock market shock 
Railroad related businesses may not be of interest to everyone  They certainly aren t typically front page news  But they are great benchmarks  and you can gather a lot of market intelligence from related earnings reports  even if you aren t interested in the sector specifically 
It s old school for sure  but I do believe that transportation stocks are leading indicators for the rest of the market and the general economy  The cycle in transportation stocks isn t over and that s an important catalyst for the broader market

155785,377301,UNP,Top Sector Offering More Capital Gains,opinion,"While business conditions are pretty good in the domestic oil and gas business  they re also holding up very well in the railroad sector 
If railroad companies and related services are old economy  they are still important economic benchmarks and they continue to be great businesses producing excellent returns to stockholders 
Union Pacific Corporation  NYSE UNP  is an important company to follow  even if you aren t interested in owning a position  What the company reports about its business conditions is material and helpful in advancing your own market view  Union Pacific reports on Thursday 
Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC  just hit an all time record high on the stock market  This time last year  the stock was around  77 00 a share  now  it s close to  107 00 
CSX Corporation  NYSE CSX  is not as large in terms of market capitalization as Norfolk Southern or Union Pacific  but it is still a  31 0 billion company with extensive operations in the eastern United States and Canada 
Its second quarter of 2014 was a record quarter with sales growing seven percent to  3 2 billion on an eight percent gain in volume 
Earnings growth was more modest  coming in at  529 million  or  0 53 per diluted share  compared to  521 million  or  0 51 per diluted share  for second quarter 2013  But management expects margin expansion going into 2015  and the Street wasn t fazed 
Like so many other large caps  the company is buying its own shares  including some  131 million worth during the most recent quarter 
By April of next year  the company will have spent  1 0 billion on share repurchases over the last two years 
Notably  CSX saw double digit volume and revenue gains from agriculture freight  chemicals  metals  and waste and equipment 
The company s biggest gain was in chemicals  which improved 18  by volume and 17  in sales over the second quarter of last year  This was due to growth from the energy sector  including the shipment of crude oil  liquefied petroleum gas  LPG   and fracturing sand 
I think a railroad company is a welcome addition in any equity market portfolio  particularly at this stage of the business cycle  where railroad companies are experiencing an increase in the shipment of freight 
Recognizing that these stocks have already gone up as institutional investors have placed their bets  there s still room for more capital appreciation within the group   See     
I continue to like Union Pacific and Canadian National Railway Company  CNI   which has extensive rail tracks in both Canada and the U S 
Canadian National Railway just reported a 17  gain in second quarter revenues to  3 12 billion in Canadian dollars  with a 14  improvement in revenue ton miles and an 11  gain in car loadings  comparatively 
The company s earnings grew nicely to  847 million  or  1 03 per diluted share  up substantially from  717 million  or  0 84 per diluted share  year over year 
Company management boosted its full year outlook slightly  stating that it expects double digit earnings per share growth this year compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2013 
For the most part  corporate performance among railroads and service companies remains excellent and these businesses are well positioned for earnings growth as the U S  economy slightly improves in the bottom half of the year 
I expect more capital gains from this sector to come

155808,377324,UNP,UNP  A Rail Stock To Consider Now,opinion,"Moody s Investors Service just boosted Union Pacific Corporation s  NYSE UNP  senior unsecured debt after the company reported another really good quarter 
The railroad company s numbers were extremely good  considering the weather in the first quarter  Total operating revenues for the quarter grew seven percent to  5 6 billion  with particularly strong growth in agricultural shipments 
A number of the company s financial metrics improved during the first quarter  Fuel costs and total operating expenses only rose marginally  contributing to an impressive 14  gain in operating income to  1 85 billion 
The company s operating ratio  an important industry metric  improved two basis points to 67 1   and diluted earnings per share grew a substantial 17  to  2 38 
Spending  683 million during the first quarter on share repurchases  the company bought back 3 8 million of its own shares at an average price of  178 85  This obviously helped with the diluted earnings per share gain 
Not one of Union Pacific s main customer groups produced a decline in its comparative first quarter freight revenues  Automotive was flat compared to last year  while chemicals and coal were up two and three percent  respectively 
Intermodal revenues grew four percent during the quarter  but the big growth came from industrial product revenues  up 10   and agricultural product revenues  up 16   comparatively 
All this from a very mature  old economy franchise  Union Pacific has been making money for shareholders left  right  and center  And with the expectation of slightly improving economic conditions domestically  there s no reason why this position can t keep ticking higher  The company s medium term stock chart is featured below 

This stock experienced a material consolidation in the bottom half of 2013  but since then the position s been soaring on renewed investor interest 
I don t like buying or recommending stocks in mature businesses at their all time highs  Very recently  Union Pacific s share price retrenched close to  180 00 per share  With all the buying the company is effecting in its own shares  2014 should be another good year for shareholders 
Most  but not all  of the other domestic railroads reported very good first quarter financial results  it s actually an exciting time to be in this industry 
New regulations are on tap regarding tanker railcar safety  and the entire railcar services group is worth having on your radar if it s not already  New railcar safety rules aren t a worry for the railroads themselves because the order backlog is vast  and frankly  they can easily afford it 
Union Pacific s balance sheet is in good shape  and Wall Street analysts are increasing their earnings expectations on the company for this year and next 
All in all it was a very good quarter  the company s been consistently producing good numbers for some time now 
The Association of American Railroads produces very good statistics on the North American railroad industry  as well as Amtrak  If you re interested in these railroad stocks or the industry  then it s worthwhile to read up on the numbers because they are very good barometers 
U S  rail traffic is growing compared to last year  especially with its most recent numbers  It s a strong sign that a company like Union Pacific will keep producing record results

155859,377375,UNP,How To Forecast Future Stock Returns  Part 3,opinion,In  and  of this three part series  we established the basic principles of valuation and provided evidence that backs those principles up  Then we demonstrated that valuation is a function of soundness based on the current earnings yield that any given level of earnings offers you  From there  we illustrated how the future rate of earnings growth  in conjunction with fair valuation  will be the primary determinants of future returns A lot of what Part 1 and Part 2 were attempting to convey is the logical and common sense nature of valuation in regards to sensible stock investing  When the investor has a solid foundation of what real valuation is all about  they are less likely to be enticed into making bad decisions by an often emotionally charged stock market  Therefore  extreme and anomalous market behavior can be recognized and dealt with accordingly  In other words  fear and greed can be controlled  thus paving the way for dialectic thinking Moreover  we tried to point out that valuation is about determining reasonable ranges of fair value  In other words  fair value is perhaps more a metaphor than a precise or absolute calculation  Furthermore  we demonstrated that a normal PE ratio of 15 represents a standard fair valuation for companies whose earnings growth rates range from 0  to 15   Once again  the PE 15 is not necessarily a perfect number  instead  it indicates a sound valuation that represents an earnings yield of 6  to 7  Therefore  and for example  the difference between a PE valuation of 14  15 or 16 is not that material to the long term investor  Obviously  the lower the PE ratio you can purchase a company at the better  But the real value in considering valuation is the determination as to whether the investment makes economic sense and whether or not the risk taken is acceptable To put it another way  higher PE ratios indicate a significantly lower return on investment  earnings yield  than prudence would dictate  In the same vein  extremely low PE ratios would indicate great opportunity  assuming that earnings are not collapsing  Consequently  two points come logically into view  Aberrant PE ratios indicate valuation imbalances  and the necessity of forecasting future earnings growth is of high importance Forecasting Future Earnings   The KeyOnce you have determined that fair valuation  plus or minus  exists  then the prudent investor should look to future earnings growth as the likely source of future long term returns  Then  by applying the same principles that we presented and discussed in Parts 1 and 2  we can calculate within a reasonable range of predictability what our future returns might be There are several methods that can be used to forecast future earnings  however  we should always remember that these are forecasts and therefore  by their very nature  imperfect  Nevertheless  having a reasonable expectation of what future returns you can expect is a lot better than hope  Furthermore  once you have purchased a stock you can use this knowledge to make smarter and sounder future buy  sell or hold decisions  In other words  you can manage your portfolios more intelligently and effectively Extensive Comprehensive Research EffortAt the end of the day  there is no substitute for a comprehensive research effort and analysis  Even then  it would be na ve to expect perfection  However  the prudent investor should be capable of determining reasonable expectations that can be relied upon to make intelligent long term investing decisions  However  it should never be forgotten that these decisions must be continuously monitored and kept up to date  Therefore  our first approach is to recommend a comprehensive research effort  For the sake of this article we once again rely on the F A S T  Graphs  research tool to facilitate this process In Part 1 and Part 2 we focused primarily on historical graphs that provided evidence supporting our thesis under real world situations  Here in Part 3  we are going to move on by focusing on the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator and the Earnings Yield Estimator  It s important to realize that these tools are calculators that simply compute whatever data is fed into them  They also offer an override feature that allows the user to input their own estimates of their choosing  thereby generating their own forecasts Nonsubscribers to F A S T  Graphs  could utilize spreadsheets or other calculating tools in order to run their own numbers  However  the important point is that we believe that prudent long term fundamental investors should be making these types of calculations  Because  we further believe that investors that have a realistic view of what their future returns may be  are better prepared to handle whatever challenges the marketplace may bring Estimating Future Earnings to Calculate Future ReturnsFor simplicity and space constraints  we are going to look at three sample companies to forecast future earnings growth and calculate future returns based on the standard 15 PE ratio  We will look at one that historically has grown at 5  or lower  one that is between 5    10   and finally  one that is above 10  and approaching our 15  inflection point  Then we will offer a fourth and final sample that looks at growth above 15  where PEG ratio valuation comes into play Less Than 5  Growth   MGE Energy Inc  MGEE MGE Energy is a holding company based in Madison  Wisconsin  It is the parent company of the regulated utility Madison Gas and Electric Co  and other subsidiaries  The 15 year historical F A S T  Graphs  shows that the company s earnings growth rate has been less than 5   Moreover  we see the earnings and price relationship once again revealed  Clearly  this company has historically traded between our standard PE ratio of 15 and the company s calculated normal PE ratio of 16 7  Most importantly  whenever it deviated from these fair valuation standards  price inevitably and quickly reverted to the mean From a long term performance point of view associated with the above earnings and price correlated graphic  we discover performance that correlates to earnings  However  the reader might note that the starting dividend yield in 1998 would have been 5 6   which is materially higher than today s 3 1   This provides another good indicator of overvaluation Although the forecasting graph  estimated earnings and return calculator  only shows one analyst forecasting future growth of 4   it should be noted that this growth rate is also consistent with the company s most recent five year average  Consequently  given the long term historical consistency of this regulated utility  a 4  growth rate seems plausible Note  for the reader to get the maximum benefit out of interpreting the forecasting charts  a few words of explanation are in order  The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator provides both near and long range forecasts  Specific earnings forecasts expressed in dollars are provided for the most current fiscal year and the next fiscal year  Then  the computer simply calculates future earnings beyond that point at the consensus five year estimated growth rate  or the most recent five year historical average Note that MGE Energy is currently trading at a PE ratio of 18 3 which is in excess of its historical normal 16 7 PE ratio and or our standard PE ratio of 15  Consequently  the rational investor might expect that the future returns from investing in this high quality utility at this high valuation could possibly limit and or diminish long term potential below historical standards  Furthermore  the risk taken to earn this potentially lower than normal rate of return is higher than normal  or even what prudence would dictate Currently  MGE Energy offers a 5 3  earnings yield  which is below our standard of 6 6   100 15 PE  that a sounder PE ratio of 15 would provide  The bottom line is that MGE Energy does provide a potential compound annual rate of return of 3 4   see yellow highlight in right hand corner of the graph  that is commensurate with its expected future operating growth  however  overvaluation indicates it might be less than historical norms Nevertheless  by utilizing the principles of valuation and earnings growth  investors can estimate  within a reasonable range of probability  the future returns on this company  Although this expectation may not be absolutely precise  it should become clear that it is certainly within the realm of reasonableness 5  to 10  Growth   Stanley Black   Decker Inc  SWK Our next example  Stanley Black   Decker Inc   a diversified global provider of hand tools  power tools and related accessories moves a little further up the growth chain with a historical record of earnings growth of 7  per annum  There are a couple of interesting points to note on this historical graphic  First of all  the normal PE ratio  15 1  and the calculated fair value PE ratio  15  turn out to be virtually identical  Second  we see that every time stock price deviates from these norms either over or under  it quickly returns to fair value  Finally  note the overvaluation in 1998 versus undervaluation currently The key takeaway that the associated performance graph on Stanley Black   Decker illustrates is the undeniable effect of valuation discrepancies  Beginning overvaluation and ending undervaluation destroyed performance except for the contribution from dividend growth Due to the quasi cyclical nature of this company s operating history  the consensus of 15 analysts expect five year earnings growth to average 11 6   However  they expect 18  earnings growth for this fiscal  calendar  year  followed by 13  growth for fiscal 2013 before averaging the 11 6  forecast  12  rounded   If the company is successful in achieving these forecasts  then a 20 3  compounded annual rate of return out to calendar year end 2017 would be a reasonable expectation At today s low valuation  Stanley Black   Decker offers a very strong and above average earnings yield of 9 6   Consequently  prospective investors are offered both a higher than normal capital appreciation potential  and a higher than normal starting current dividend yield  On the other hand  and once again due to the quasi cyclical nature of this company s operating history  the more prudent investor might want to calculate the future growth rate of this company at a more conservative level  The following Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator uses an override calculation of 7  estimated growth based on the company s most recent five year historical average earnings growth rate  What is interesting about this next forecast  and what we believe the reader should recognize and understand  is that because we still calculate fair value at our standard PE ratio of 15  the company continues to offer an earnings yield of 9 6  even at the slower estimated growth rate  However  what is materially different is the future expectation of a total compounded annual return that drops from our previous expectation in excess of 20  to a lower estimate of 16 8  Perhaps the most interesting part of this is how low valuations can still provide excellent long term returns even if earnings growth rates turn out to be lower than current forecasts  In other words  the prudent investors should realize that it is the combination of valuation coupled with earnings growth that ultimately delivers returns  Excessively high valuation can destroy future returns  while low valuations can enhance them 10    15   Growth  Union Pacific Corp  UNP Union Pacific Corp   one of America s leading railways  moves further up the growth chain as it approaches the 15  per annum earnings growth inflection point  The company s historical operating earnings growth rate of 14 4  shows that even at this high rate of growth  the standard PE ratio of 15 continues to be relevant  Studying this earnings and price correlating graph validates the idea that it makes the most sense to invest in this company at a PE ratio of 15 or lower  The consensus of 28 leading analysts expects Union Pacific Corp  to grow earnings at a rate of 20  through this fiscal year  followed by 14  next fiscal year  From fiscal year 2013 on  earnings are grown at the long term consensus forecast of 15 3  per annum  Therefore  our long term target return including dividends is expected to be 16 5   Also  the reader should note that the formula used to calculate future fair valuation in this example is the PEG ratio  PE equal Growth rate  Union Pacific Corp  offers investors a current earnings yield of 7   Furthermore  since the company currently trades at approximately fair value  our long term target return expectation of 16 8  approximates earnings growth plus dividends As growth rates become higher and higher  the power of compounding becomes more and more of a factor  The key to understanding how much of a factor is to recognize that compounding is a function of how long it takes a number to double  Therefore  when you shorten the time it takes for a double to occur  the more doubles you can achieve over a longer term time frame We use the Rule of 72 to calculate a rough estimate of how long it takes money to double at a given rate of return  Using our consensus 15 3  growth rate for Union Pacific Corp   we calculate that it will take approximately 4 7 years for a dollar s worth of earnings to double  This doubling of earnings in the time it takes is calculated and circled on the following 10 year Earnings Yield Estimate table Interestingly  Union Pacific Corp  s historical five year average growth rate of 18 2  per annum is higher than its longer term 14 4   Therefore  it seems logical that we might want to run a forecast utilizing the company s more recent accelerated earnings growth  Utilizing a forecast of 18 2  growth expands our target return potential to 22 2  per annum  This further illustrates the mathematics and logic behind rational estimates of the rate of return opportunities possible utilizing different annual earnings growth rates Once again  utilizing the Rule of 72  we discover that it only takes approximately 3 95 years to double our earnings  In other words  we get our first doubling almost a year sooner at 18 2  than we do at 15 3    Later in the article we will provide a simple exercise that illustrates the dramatic results that getting a double sooner means to wealth generation  The important point here is that the company s current PE ratio of 15 7 does not change  therefore  the company still offers a current earnings yield of 7   The real difference is the accelerated future earnings growth rate that if it proved accurate  would indicate a higher future fair value PE ratio of 18 2 based on utilizing a PEG ratio formula for calculating fair value Fast GrowthOne of the real keys to understanding how the compounding effect from faster growth influences valuation is to recognize the exponential nature of compounding  Since a faster growth rate shortens the time it takes a number to double  compounding needs to be thought of as geometric growth rather than arithmetic growth  The following simple exercise vividly illustrates the power and importance of compounding numbers In order to allow this exercise to be meaningful  we re going to carefully select our parameters  First of all  we re going to measure the effects of compounding over a 36 year period which we will call the hypothetical average working lifespan of an individual  Then we are going to compare what happens if we earned two precise hypothetical returns  10  versus 20  If looked at with an arithmetic perspective it would be easy to erroneously assume that earning 20  over a lifetime would generate twice the amount of money that earning 10  over a lifetime would generate  However  doubling our rate of return cuts in half the time it takes our money to double and therefore  we get more doubles over our given time period  Therefore  the numbers look like this Utilizing the Rule of 72  we calculate that it takes 7 2 years  72  10   7 2  to double our money at 10  growth  However  we learn that it only takes 3 6 years  72 20   3 6  to double our money at 20  growth  Since we chose to measure this over a 36 year period  we discover the following dynamics  If our money doubles every 7 2 years at 10  growth  we get 5 doubles of our money in 36 years  36 7 2   5   However  at 20  growth our money doubles every 3 6 years  36 3 6   10  giving us 10 doubles instead of 5  In other words  by doubling our rate of return we cut in half the time it takes our money to double and therefore get double the doubles The mathematics looks like this   1 00 doubling 5 times at 10  growth over 36 years    2 00   4 00   8 00   16 00 and finally  32 00  However  at 20  growth we get 10 doubles  thereby adding 5 doubles over the same time frame  and the math looks like this as we double our dollar 5 additional times   64 00   128 00   256 00   512 00 and finally  1024 00  Therefore  earning 10  on our money over our 36 year lifetime turns every  1 00 we invest into  32 00  However  at 20  growth  we turn every  1 00 we invest into  1024  32 X as much money  over our lifetime  This is the power of compounding and the effect it has on valuation Above 15  Growth   Fossil Inc   FOSL Fossil Inc  is an example of a company that has averaged over 20  annual earnings growth since 1998  Notice at the bottom of the graph that  0 46 of earnings in 1998 grew to  4 67 worth of earnings  or 10 times greater  by 2011  Compare this with some of the slower growth examples we used earlier  and the power of compounding at higher rates comes into clearer focus Since Fossil Inc  expected to average over 20  growth over the next 5 years  its theoretical value would imply a PE ratio of 20  Therefore  assuming it achieves the earnings growth estimates as expected  the current PE of 13 5 indicates that the company is undervalued  Consequently  the long term rate of return expectation of 27 5  per annum implies a PE expansion plus earnings growth of 20  per annum The following 10 year Earnings Yield Estimates table illustrates how the future value of this company

155885,377401,UNP,Supreme Errors   Updated Version,opinion,In the wake of my last commentary on the horrendous Supreme Court decision upholding Obama s health care plan  several people have pointed out that I erred in saying that the income tax is a  direct tax   While it is technically correct that the Court ultimately declared it to be an excise  not a direct tax  it is important to understand how I arrived at that opinion and why the decision has no practical relevance to the way the tax has been enforced  Just as it has done with Obamacare  the Court came up with a technically constitutional pathway to allow the government to collect a tax in a blatantly unconstitutional manner In the 1895 Pollock v  Farmers  Loan and Trust case  the Supreme Court declared the original Income Tax of 1894 unconstitutional because it imposed a direct tax that was not apportioned to the states according to the taxing provisions of the Constitution  For example it said that a tax on rental income is the same as a direct tax on the property that produced the income  In other words  a tax on income was tantamount to a tax on its source To get around this  in 1913 Congress passed  and the state governments ratified  the 16th Amendment that authorized a tax on income from whatever source derived without regard to apportionment  However  in 1916 the Supreme Court ruled in Brushaber v  Union Pacific Rail Road that the Amendment  conferred no new taxing power to the Federal government   and that it  contained nothing challenging or repudiated its ruling in the Pollock case    Instead  the Court said that in order to be constitutionally taxed as an excise  income must first be separated from its source  A few years later in Eisner v  Macomber  1918  and Merchants Loan and Trust v  Smietanka  1921  the Court provided a practical guide to doing just that  by defining income  for purposes of the Sixteenth Amendment  as a corporate profit A corporation determines profit by subtracting its expenses from its income  The difference  called profit  could then be subject to an income tax  So if a corporation has rental income  but derives no profit after backing out all of its expenses  then the rents  and therefore the property  are not taxed  In that respect  the income is separated from the sources that produced it  Were it not for this separation  a tax on rents  dividends  fees  etc  would be a direct tax on the sources of income  as described by Pollock  Brushaber  Eisner and Smietanka  That is why many U S  corporations can have billions of dollars of income but pay no tax  because they derive no profits from that income  This proves the income tax is  in reality  a profits tax The problem is that the modern income tax is not merely being levied as an excise tax on corporate profits  but as an unapportioned direct tax on the personal income of every American  This is precisely what the Supreme Court has repeatedly held to be unconstitutional  Yet lower courts have serially ignored the reasoning behind these Supreme Court decisions and have allowed the Federal Government to impose a tax in the precise manner that the Supreme Court ruled it lacked the constitutional authority to do The Founding Fathers made it difficult for Congress to levy direct taxes because they considered the more easily avoidable excise taxes to be self correcting as to abuse  They also wanted to make it more difficult for poorer states to vote for taxes that would be paid disproportionately by wealthier states  As a result  they believed that during peacetime the Federal Government would rely primarily on excise taxes and would resort to direct taxes mainly during wartime To levy an apportioned direct tax on personal income  Congress would first have to decide how much it wanted to raise and then assign each state its pro rata share  So a  1 trillion dollar income tax would require Mississippi and Connecticut  each with about 1  of the U S  population  to pay about  10 billion  However since per capita income in Connecticut is 80  higher than it is in Mississippi  federal income tax rates in Mississippi would have to be 80  higher than the rates in Connecticut  This makes it less likely that Mississippi would support such a tax  But given the way the income tax is currently enforced  Mississippi happily votes for levies that fall predominately on residents of wealthier states  This is precisely what the Constitution was written to prevent Just as a tax on land based solely on its rental income is the same as a direct tax on the land itself  a tax on individuals based solely on their decision not to buy health insurance is a direct tax on individuals  To get around this  Chief Justice Roberts ruled that the new healthcare tax is indirect because not everyone will have to pay it  However  the percentage of people ultimately subject to a tax does not determine into which category it falls  Less than two percent of Americans were subject to the original income tax  yet the court still viewed it as a direct tax The bottom line is that the Supreme Court has a history of giving the government latitude to get around the Constitution  Instead of looking at the intent of legislation  even when the legislators are alive to be asked   or even its practical effect  the Court looks for any legal technicality upon which to base a ruling of constitutionality  That is what happened with the income tax  and is now occurring with the Affordable Care Act  Had the Supreme Court been more forthright with the income tax  the country would not now be suffering from a destructive and pervasive tax that was originally intended to be a small levy targeted only at the top 1  of American earners Remember  the Court s sole rationale for ruling the exactions in the Affordable Care Act are taxes rather than penalties was its belief that the taxes are too low to actually compel anyone to buy health insurance  This made it consistent with the Court s view that Congress lacks the authority  under the commerce clause  to compel Americans to buy health insurance  If the Court believed that the tax was actually high enough to leave Americans with no rational choice  Roberts would have ruled it unconstitutional  This may be the one thing the Court got right  However  once the government realizes that it has underpriced the fines  it will certainly raise the tax rate substantially to stop healthy people from rationally dropping their coverage  because insurance companies could not deny them similarly priced coverage after they got sick   Just as they routinely do now with respect to the income taxes  the lower courts will likely misinterpret the Supreme Court s ruling and rubber stamp any future rate hikes  For political reasons it is unlikely that a Constitutional challenge to such an increase will ever make it back up to the Supreme Court This leaves us few good options  Unless Congress repeals the legislation quickly we will likely have to live with it for a long  long time  Sadly  despite the Romney and the Republicans  promises to do just that with election victories this fall  there is virtually no precedent for government giving up a power that it has fought to take  In the end Americans will be forced to purchase health insurance in the manner the Supreme Court just ruled to be unconstitutional ,2012-07-04,Euro Pacific,https://www.investing.com/analysis/supreme-errors---updated-version-128504,128504
155886,377402,UNP,How To Forecast Future Stock Returns  Part 3 ,opinion,IntroductionIn Part 1 and Part 2 of this three part series  we established the basic principles of valuation and provided evidence that backs those principles up  Then we demonstrated that valuation is a function of soundness based on the current earnings yield that any given level of earnings offers you  From there  we illustrated how the future rate of earnings growth  in conjunction with fair valuation  will be the primary determinants of future returns A lot of what Part 1 and Part 2 were attempting to convey is the logical and common sense nature of valuation in regards to sensible stock investing  When the investor has a solid foundation of what real valuation is all about  they are less likely to be enticed into making bad decisions by an often emotionally charged stock market  Therefore  extreme and anomalous market behavior can be recognized and dealt with accordingly  In other words  fear and greed can be controlled  thus paving the way for dialectic thinking Moreover  we tried to point out that valuation is about determining reasonable ranges of fair value  In other words  fair value is perhaps more a metaphor than a precise or absolute calculation  Furthermore  we demonstrated that a normal PE ratio of 15 represents a standard fair valuation for companies whose earnings growth rates range from 0  to 15   Once again  the PE 15 is not necessarily a perfect number  instead  it indicates a sound valuation that represents an earnings yield of 6  to 7  Therefore  and for example  the difference between a PE valuation of 14  15 or 16 is not that material to the long term investor  Obviously  the lower the PE ratio you can purchase a company at the better  But the real value in considering valuation is the determination as to whether the investment makes economic sense and whether or not the risk taken is acceptable To put it another way  higher PE ratios indicate a significantly lower return on investment  earnings yield  than prudence would dictate  In the same vein  extremely low PE ratios would indicate great opportunity  assuming that earnings are not collapsing  Consequently  two points come logically into view   Aberrant PE ratios indicate valuation imbalances  and the necessity of forecasting future earnings growth is of high importance Forecasting Future Earnings   The KeyOnce you have determined that fair valuation  plus or minus  exists  then the prudent investor should look to future earnings growth as the likely source of future long term returns  Then  by applying the same principles that we presented and discussed in Parts 1 and 2  we can calculate within a reasonable range of predictability what our future returns might be There are several methods that can be used to forecast future earnings  however  we should always remember that these are forecasts and therefore  by their very nature  imperfect  Nevertheless  having a reasonable expectation of what future returns you can expect is a lot better than hope  Furthermore  once you have purchased a stock you can use this knowledge to make smarter and sounder future buy  sell or hold decisions  In other words  you can manage your portfolios more intelligently and effectively Extensive Comprehensive Research EffortAt the end of the day  there is no substitute for a

upon to make intelligent long term investing decisions  However  it should never be forgotten that these decisions must be continuously monitored and kept up to date  Therefore  our first approach is to recommend a comprehensive research effort  For the sake of this article we once again rely on the F A S T  Graphs  research tool to facilitate this process In Part 1 and Part 2 we focused primarily on historical graphs that provided evidence supporting our thesis under real world situations  Here in Part 3  we are going to move on by focusing on the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator and

of 18 2  growth expands our target return potential to 22 2  per annum  This further illustrates the mathematics and logic behind rational estimates of the rate of return opportunities possible utilizing different annual earnings growth rates Once again  utilizing the Rule of 72  we discover that it only takes approximately 3 95 years to double our earnings  In other words  we get our first doubling almost a year sooner at 18 2  than we do at 15 3    Later in the article we will provide a simple exercise that illustrates the dramatic results that getting a double sooner means to wealth generation  The important point here is that the company s current PE ratio of 15 7 does not change  therefore  the company still offers a current earnings yield of 7   The real difference is the accelerated future earnings growth rate that if it proved accurate  would indicate a higher future fair value PE ratio of 18 2 based on utilizing a PEG ratio formula for calculating fair value Fast GrowthOne of the real keys to understanding how the compounding effect from faster growth influences valuation is to recognize the exponential nature of compounding  Since a faster growth rate shortens the time it takes a number to double  compounding needs to be thought of as geometric growth rather than arithmetic growth  The following simple exercise vividly illustrates the power and importance of compounding numbers In order to allow this exercise to be meaningful  we re going to carefully select our parameters  First of all  we re going to measure the effects of compounding over a 36 year period which we will call the hypothetical average working lifespan of an individual  Then we are going to compare what happens if we earned two precise hypothetical returns  10  versus 20  If looked at with an arithmetic perspective it would be easy to erroneously assume that earning 20  over a lifetime would generate twice the amount of money that earning 10  over a lifetime would generate  However  doubling our rate of return cuts in half the time it takes our money to double and therefore  we get more doubles over our given time period  Therefore  the numbers look like this Utilizing the Rule of 72  we calculate that it takes 7 2 years  72  10   7 2  to double our money at 10  growth  However  we learn that it only takes 3 6 years  72 20   3 6  to double our money at 20  growth  Since we chose to measure this over a 36 year period  we discover the following dynamics  If our money doubles every 7 2 years at 10  growth  we get 5 doubles of our money in 36 years  36 7 2   5   However  at 20  growth our money doubles every 3 6 years  36 3 6   10  giving us 10 doubles instead of 5  In other words  by doubling our rate of return we cut in half the time it takes our money to double and therefore get double the doubles The mathematics looks like this   1 00 doubling 5 times at 10  growth over 36 years    2 00   4 00   8 00   16 00 and finally  32 00  However  at 20  growth we get 10 doubles  thereby adding 5 doubles over the same time frame  and the math looks like this as we double our dollar 5 additional times   64 00   128 00   256 00   512 00 and finally  1024 00  Therefore  earning 10  on our money over our 36 year lifetime turns every  1 00 we invest into  32 00  However  at 20  growth  we turn every  1 00 we invest into  1024  32 X as much money  over our lifetime  This is the power of compounding and the effect it has on valuation Above 15  Growth   Fossil Inc   FOSL Fossil Inc  is an example of a company that has averaged over 20  annual earnings growth since 1998  Notice at the bottom of the graph that  0 46 of earnings in 1998 grew to  4 67 worth of earnings  or 10 times greater  by 2011  Compare this with some of the slower growth examples we used earlier  and the power of compounding at higher rates comes into clearer focus Since Fossil Inc  expected to average over 20  growth over the next 5 years  its theoretical value would imply a PE ratio of 20  Therefore  assuming it achieves the earnings growth estimates as expected  the current PE of 13 5 indicates that the company is undervalued  Consequently  the long term rate of return expectation of 27 5  per annum implies a PE expansion plus earnings growth of 20  per annum The following 10 year Earnings Yield Estimates table illustrates how the future value of this company might occur  If in fact it was capable of growing at 20  a year for the next 10 years  as it has over the past 15 years  then future earnings would grow from today s  5 34 to  26 66 by 2021  see circles on a 10 year earnings yield estimates table   The point being  that if this were to happen  then the market would have a significantly larger future income stream to capitalize than it does today  This would be the source of a much higher future valuation  again  assuming it occurs as forecast Summaries and ConclusionThis article  and the two that preceded it  were offered to present how to utilize the essence of valuation coupled with earnings growth to determine returns on your common stocks  At its core  fair valuation implies a valuation level or price where the company s cash flows  earnings  represent a reasonable and achievable return on investment  In other words  is the company making its owners enough money to be considered an attractive investment It s vitally important to understand that stock markets are not always efficient  as many scholars try to lead us to believe  Stock prices can  will  and do deviate  sometimes dramatically so  from fair value  However  it is our experience and observation over many decades  that fair valuation will inevitably revert to its mean when aberrant values exist  Therefore  recognizing when either extreme overvaluation or undervaluation is manifest empowers investors to make smarter and certainly sounder long term decisions The principles presented in this series are most relevant to long term serious investors  Shorter term oriented traders may not find these principles of much use  On the other hand  we question whether or not short term traders can truly find any principles that are of much practical use over the longer run The logic supporting these statements are that forecasting business results can be done within a reasonable amount of accuracy  On the other hand  forecasting the short term gyrations of an often emotionally charged marketplace are impossible  other than by mere chance  This is because these gyrations are often emotionally driven  and therefore  illogical by their very nature Finally  we believe that if more people were focused on  and understood the mathematical principles and realities that underpin sound valuation  then unsettling price volatility would diminish  People would still debate what precise forecast growth rate should be applied to a given company  Differences in these forecasts would create differences in the long term return expectations However  differences in current valuation  given the reality of a normal PE ratio based on earnings yield  would keep stocks reasonably priced  Therefore investing would become less speculative and market gyrations more calm  Stockmarkets would function better  and investors would have more confidence and be more capable of better long term strategic planning for their
