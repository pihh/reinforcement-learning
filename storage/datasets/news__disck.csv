181501,403017,DISCK,Should Value Investors Pick Discovery Communications  DISCK  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA   Inc    NASDAQ DISCK   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discovery Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 1  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Discovery Communications  current PE ratio much below its midpoint  which is 16 8  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Discovery Communications has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 2 so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discovery Communications  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Discovery Communications has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discovery Communications currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DISCK a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 0  which is considerably better than the industry average of 7 4  Clearly  DISCK is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Discovery Communications might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives DISCK a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased about 4 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discovery Communications  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDiscovery Communications is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 40  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  10 Minute Stock Picking SecretSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year

NASDAQ DISCA   Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDiscovery  Inc  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 32  out of more
