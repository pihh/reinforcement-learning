3623,225138,BSPM,4 Stocks To Watch  AMBA  GIMO  MDVN  NVDA,opinion,"Folks  it was a mixed consolidation day  but a lot of stocks we follow continue to do well  some actually broke out  Let s take a look at a few of the longs we like or acted well on Thursday 
Ambarella Inc  NASDAQ AMBA   a recent swing trade idea  came down  formed a nice base  broke out and surged in May  consolidated from early June  formed a big flag type pattern  and then on Wednesday it popped  and followed through on Thursday  up 1 20 to 52 23  or 2 35   on 778 082 shares traded  I would like to see AMBA get through the near term target in the 54 range  If it gets through that  look for it to run up to 60  maybe 65  It has 6 6 days to cover 
Gigamon Inc  NYSE GIMO  is a swing trade that is acting well  It popped and broke out in May  pulled back in a nice pullback wedge  and held support in the highs 20 s  Since then it has gone up to 39  almost 40 on Thursday  up 1 20 to 39 27  or 4 22   on nearly a million shares  The all time high for GIMO came in at 41 81  I think it s headed to that area  It has 3 7 days to cover 
Medivation Inc  NASDAQ MDVN  looks like it s preparing for an explosive move  On Thursday  it was up 41 cents to 62 74  on 1 3 million shares  and consolidated on low volume  Low volume and a pullback is causing a little flag  If it gets above 63  and it got up to 62 98  it may very well start to run again into the high 60 s for starters 
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  is a swing trade of ours  It has four waves up  and the consolidation leads me to believe it may be headed to 55  On Thursday it was up 1 24 to 48 89  or 2 6   on 9 8 million shares  Thursday s action tells me that it may have already started the move  which could take it up 6 or 7 points  It has 4 94 days to cover

Gold did act great on Wednesday  so we will be looking at several gold stocks as well 
Accelerate Diagnostics  Inc   NASDAQ AXDX  made a big move on Wednesday  up 3 19 to 16 87  or 23   on 912 037 shares traded  It has a hundred million in cash and 28 days to cover  some strong fundamentals  With a breakout on Wednesday of this nature  and 900 000 shares traded  which is good volume for that stock  we may very well be seeing a retest of the 19 20 zone  and then following that 23 24  Those are the targets  Be sure to watch the short position 
Exact Sciences Corporation  NASDAQ EXAS  is very interesting  I put a swing on it on Wednesday after it pulled back  Looking at the stock now after having gone from 5 30 to 12 1 2 pre market  One hundred and fifty percent in about three weeks  We decided to wait for the pullback and we got the pullback  The fundamentals and technicals look good  It has 13 days to cover  I think the pullback was a buying opportunity  and the best thing it could do is be up on Thursday  but it may back and fill in here for a bit  consolidate the base breakout  then head up to 12 1 2  and then 15  On Wednesday it was down 6 cents to 9 33  on 39 million shares  which is very good volume 
Stocks on the Short Side    
athenahealth  Inc   NASDAQ ATHN  has been down five days in a row  including Wednesday  down 59 cents to 129 25  on 158 211 shares traded  I m looking for that one  smack  day to take it down sharply into the 120 22 range  I think it may be coming  It has 20 days to cover  The shorts could be right on this one 
Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc   NYSE CMG  reversed back down again after having one good day  It has gone from 402 00 to 389 00  closing down 4 95 to 390 31  or 1 25   on 1 2 million shares on Wednesday  Watch this one if it gets under 385 00  It could be down to 350 00 pretty quickly
