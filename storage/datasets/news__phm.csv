Prepared Remarks 
OperatorLadies and gentlemen  thank you for standing by  and welcome to the Q4 2019 PulteGroup Inc  Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions I d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Jim Zeumer  Please go ahead  sir James P  Zeumer    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsOkay  Thank you  James  and good morning  I want to welcome participants to this morning s call to discuss PulteGroup s outstanding fourth quarter 2019 operating and financial results I m joined this morning by Ryan Marshall  President and CEO  Bob O Shaughnessy  Executive Vice President and CFO  and Jim Ossowski  Senior VP of Finance A copy of this morning s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup com  We will also post an audio replay of today s call to our website a little later today I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported results today as well as results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain significant items  A reconciliation of these adjusted results to our reported results is included in this morning s release and within the webcast slides accompanying this call  We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our results Before I turn the call over to Ryan  I want to alert everyone that today s presentation includes forward looking statements about the Company s expected future performance  Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today  The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides  These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings  including our annual and quarterly reports Now let me turn the call over to Ryan  Ryan Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jim  and good morning As detailed in this morning s press release  PulteGroup s fourth quarter results closed out 2019 on a high note  which I believe positions the Company for even greater success is in the year ahead  Our outstanding Q4 results reflect the strength of our overall market positions and homebuilding operations in combination with an ongoing acceleration and fundamental housing demand  What I view as particularly encouraging is the broad based strength of the housing market  as our Q4 order rates were higher across each of our geographic areas and across each of the buyer groups we serve  Reflective of this strength in demand  traffic to our stores was up 14  over the prior year  while order rates increased 33  Housing continues to benefit from favorable market dynamics  including strong employment  consumer confidence and demographic numbers which have underpinned demand for the last several years  I think improved affordability across many markets is now adding incremental support and allowing more consumers to get actively engaged in the home buying process While the slow start to 2019 resulted in our full year closings and revenues being up only slightly over last year  we still delivered increased earnings per share  generated  1 1 billion in operating cash flow    and that s after having invested  3 billion into the business    and we also returned almost  400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases  We were also successful in strengthening our financial position  having retired  274 million of our bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2021  with this helping us to enter the new year with a net debt to cap of only 21 7   Couple of all of this with our highest ending backlog in over a decade  and I think it s clear that we are extremely well positioned to grow the business and deliver even greater financial results in 2020 While I am excited to speak with you this morning about this morning s announced acquisition of Innovative Construction Group  I m first going to turn the call over to Bob so he can finish reviewing our financial results  Bob Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  and good morning  everyone PulteGroup s order volume and absorption rate were the highest we have generated in the fourth quarter in more than a decade  For the period net new orders totaled 5 691 homes  which is an increase of 33  over the prior year  As Ryan indicated  we experienced strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups  For the quarter  our first time buyer orders increased 57  to 1 743 homes  Move up orders increased 27  to 2 471 homes  while active adult orders increased 22  to 1 477 homes In the quarter we operated an average of 865 communities which is an increase of 5  over the prior year community count of 825  Adjusting for community count  absorption pace was up 27  over last year  Consistent with our orders  we realized higher absorption rates across our entire portfolio  as absorptions increased 38  among first time buyers  29  among move up buyers and 10  among active adult buyers The improved operating environment contributed to the Company s strong financial performance in the quarter as home sale revenues increased to  2 9 billion  Higher revenues in the period were driven by a 2  increase in closings to 6 822 homes as our average sales price was down less than 1  to  429 000  Our average sale price for the period reflects a combination of pricing dynamics and mix shifts realized in the period More specifically  our average sales price for move up and active adult closings increased 4  to  494 000 and  423 000 respectively  while pricing for first time homes decreased by 8  to  342 000  It s worth noting that the decrease in first time ASP reflects the ongoing and purposeful expansion of our entry level business  particularly in the Southeast Florida and Texas This successful expansion of our first time business is also demonstrated in the mix of our fourth quarter closings  By buyer group  closings in the quarter were comprised of 32  first time  45  move up  and 23  active adult as compared with 26  first time  47  move up  and 27  active adult in the fourth quarter last year  These results include the closing of 432 more first time homes this quarter than the fourth quarter last year  Given the increased investment we have been making in assets that serve this buyer group  we believe we are well positioned to continue expanding this element of our business The strong order environment has also contributed to a 20  increase in our backlog over the same period last year to 10 507 homes  As a result  we ve been increasing our production such that we had 10 780 homes under construction at the end of the quarter  which is up 14  over last year  Of the homes under production  69  are sold  while the remaining 31  are spec  On a percentage basis  spec production is down from last year  but up sequentially  This largely reflects the introduction of incremental spec units on our entry level communities as we seek production efficiencies and to meet the move and ready expectations of that buyer group Given the homes we have under contract and in production  we expect first quarter deliveries to be in the range of 5 300 to 5 500 homes  At the midpoint  this would represent an increase of 17  over the first quarter of 2019  With this strong start to the year  we expect full year deliveries to be in the range of 25 500 to 26 250 homes in 2020  Based on the relative strength of our first time communities  we expect the average sales price of closings in the first quarter will be in the range of  410 000 to  415 000  with full year ASP in the range of  415 000 to  420 000 Continuing down the income statement  Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was 22 8  compared with prior year reported and adjusted gross margin of 21 5  and 23 8  respectively  Our gross margin for the quarter came in lower than our previous guidance due to a number of factors  Notably  we delivered more homes than we expected in California where pricing was under pressure much of the year  In addition  we realized higher than expected warranty costs at a limited number of previously closed communities  and we recorded a couple of minor inventory impairments  While none of these items were individually significant  together they did act as a margin drag in the period  Demonstrating the real ongoing strength of our business  we expect our first quarter gross margin to increase sequentially and to be in the range of 23  to 23 3   In fact  the potential is there for margins to improve further as the year progresses  and we currently expect full year gross margins to be in the range of 23  to 23 4  Our reported fourth quarter SG A expense of  262million or 8 9  of home sale revenues included a  31 million pre tax benefit from an insurance reserve adjustment recorded in the period  Excluding this benefit  our adjusted SG A expense was  293 million or 10  of home sale revenues  SG A expense for the prior year fourth quarter was  292 million or 10 1  of home sale revenues  With expectations for higher closing volumes in 2020  we believe we can realize incremental overhead leverage  As such  we expect SG A expense for 2020 to be in the range of 10 5  to 10 9  of home sale revenues Our Financial Services operations generated fourth quarter pre tax income of  34 million compared with  5 million in the fourth quarter of last year  Last year s results included a charge of  16 million for a reserve adjustment recorded in the period  This year s improved financial performance also benefited from a strong margin environment  higher loan volumes resulting from growth in our homebuilding operations as well as a higher capture rate  In fact  our mortgage capture rate increased to 84  from 77  last year In the fourth quarter  our income tax expense was  100 million or an effective tax rate of 23  compared with  92 million or an effective tax rate of 27 9  last year  Our fourth quarter rate was lower than our previous guide as we benefited from an adjustment of a valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets as well as the benefit related to the recent approval of the energy tax credit  Looking ahead for 2020  we expect our base effective tax rate to be approximately 25  In total  our reported net income was  336 million or  1 22 per share in the quarter  On an adjusted basis  our net income for the quarter was  312 million or  1 14 per share  In the prior year our reported net income in the fourth quarter was  238 million or  0 84 per share while adjusted net income was  314 million for  1 11 per share  Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was calculated using approximately 271 million shares  which is down 9 million shares or roughly 3  from the fourth quarter of last year  Our lower share count is due primarily to our ongoing share repurchase activities During the fourth quarter we invested  771 million in land acquisition and development spend  bringing our total land spend for 2019 to  3 billion  We ended the year with approximately 158 000 lots under control  with 41  of them held via option  Looking to 2020  we expect our total land spend to increase to approximately  3 2 billion  Given our existing land pipeline  we expect full year 2020 community count growth of 1  to 3  over 2019  Growth will be closer to 3  to 5  in the first quarter of the year  reflecting the benefit of last year s American West acquisition In the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 765 000 common shares for  30 million or an average price of  39 16 per share  For the full year  we repurchased 8 4 million shares for  274 million or an average price of  32 52 per share  After all this activity  we ended 2019 with  1 2 billion of cash and  as Ryan mentioned  a net debt to capital ratio of 21 7   On a gross basis  our debt to capital ratio was 33 6   which is down 500 basis points from last year Let me now turn the call back to Ryan for some additional comments  Ryan Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bob Consistent with the 33  increase in orders  the demand environment in the fourth quarter was obviously much stronger than last year  We saw generally strong demand in the eastern third of the country  with Florida continuing to deliver exceptional performance  Demand in our Midwest and Texas operations was also much improved  with our Texas business in particular benefiting from increased business among first time buyers  Demand out West was certainly much stronger in the quarter  and I would cautiously highlight that Northern California appears to be finding its footing after a tough 12 plus months Strong fourth quarter demand  which has continued into the first few weeks of January  has us heading into 2020 with much higher expectations than we had at this time last year  We are optimistic that a good macroeconomic backdrop and better affordability should keep buyer interest high in the year ahead Now  with the review of our operating and financial results complete  I want to discuss PulteGroup s acquisition of Innovative Construction Group or ICG  For several years you ve heard the construction industry talk about a tight labor market and how this is adding to our construction costs and cycle times  Given these conditions  you ve also heard us discuss efforts to expand the use of offsite manufacturing in our construction operations As you know  we launched our commonly managed plan platform in 2011 to better standardize our product offering and simplify our purchasing and construction processes  In 2019  81  of our closings were from our common plan portfolio  With the success of this platform  we have viewed capturing the benefits of offsite manufacturing as the next logical step Over the last 18 months  we ve met with numerous businesses that are working to bring increased automation to homebuilding  It is through this work that we identified ICG  which provides framing solutions to residential and commercial contractors in and around the Jacksonville market  ICG s offsite solution includes offering design services  manufacturing wall panels  roof trusses and floor systems  and onsite installation to provide a full frame shell construction process In evaluating ICG  we were very impressed by the management team  along with the product quality  production efficiency and overall innovation of the plant s operations  Working closely with the company founders  who will continue to lead ICG going forward  we plan to extend the use of pre assembled floor systems and to expand the factory s production capabilities to include installed windows and wall prep for mechanical  electrical and plumbing  ICG will remain a stand alone operation and continue serving its existing customer base and build our clients This acquisition has the potential to benefit our Jacksonville operations through faster cycle times  precision structural components and savings on lumber and other materials  More importantly  we see this facility as a model for integrating increased offsite production in other PulteGroup divisions  While likely a few years down the road  the opportunity is there to develop comparable production plants in areas where our scale in adjacent markets can support a dedicated factory It is important to note that ICG is just one component of our strategy as we do continue to partner with key suppliers to move more of our production into a factory setting  This is one plant  serving one market  but we re greatly encouraged by the potential offsite production it offers to enhance our operations in North Florida today and other markets in the future  We see the opportunity to produce high quality components with greater efficiency  while allowing PulteGroup to work more effectively with its trade partners  We look forward to providing updates on this venture and related activities as they develop Before opening the call to questions  I want to welcome the employees of ICG into the PulteGroup family and thank our entire team for their outstanding work in 2019  Thanks to your efforts  the Company is operationally and financially strong  and we head into 2020 with tremendous momentum Now let me turn the call back to Jim Zeumer James P  Zeumer    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsOkay  Thanks  Ryan We ll now open the call for questions  So that we can speak to as many participants as possible during the remaining time of this call  we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow up James  you explain the process again  We ll get started Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan  Go ahead please  Your line is open Michael Rehaut    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  thanks  Good morning  everyone  First question I had was just on the drivers of the gross margin for 2020  expecting a little bit of improvement  I was hoping you can break down how you re thinking about the different components of those drivers by either mix  pricing  cost inflation  what are the bigger drivers there Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMike  it s Bob  Obviously  when we look at the business and how we want to project our margins going forward  the first place we start is our backlog  We ve got a strong backlog coming through the year  so we know the pricing embedded in that  We think about how the business has performed largely over the last three months as we ve built that backlog  And so    as an example  California  we ve seen pricing get a little bit firmer out there  We ve seen a little bit more volume So I guess as simply as I could say it is  based on what we see in our backlog  we re not assuming price appreciation  I can tell you that as we look at vertical construction costs in fiscal  20  we see about a 1  increase  so relatively modest inflation  Lot costs are obviously going to get a little more expensive as we move more recent  Indecipherable  the portfolio  But again  that s all factored in  But we re not assuming price appreciation in that guidance Michael Rehaut    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  I appreciate it  I guess my second question was around    and I apologize I was pulled away for a moment during some of the prepared remarks    the ICG acquisition  I was curious about that in terms of the rationale    and again  I apologize if you ve kind of addressed this already    but just the rationale behind buying the company outright versus being a customer as is and reaping the benefits of the efficiencies of the business or the business relationship as simply as a customer or perhaps making an equity investment to allow the company to grow further without fully consolidating it and kind of adding an additional cost structure  so to speak  on to your own book Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Mike  it s Ryan  And good morning  Thanks for the question  I think as we looked at    the way I d explain that as we look at ICG  I think there are a number of different ways that we potentially could have reaped some of the benefits associated with the offsite manufacturing  You highlighted a number of those  We elected to go the route that we did for a number of reasons which I probably won t get into on this call What I will tell you is  the path that we ve chosen to take on this particular acquisition was right for this particular opportunity  Where we re going to is  as we look at our entire operation across the country  continue to leverage relationships with other suppliers where we re looking to move as much of our production into automated type factory settings as we can  and in many of those cases  it will be with existing suppliers that are bringing technology to the table We are going to use the learnings from this plant to certainly enhance right away our Jacksonville operations  and we ll use those learnings down the road to potentially look at standing up new plants of our own where we have the right amount of volume to support those  So we re really excited about what this does  It s been a journey frankly in the making since 2011 when we started our commonly managed plan portfolio  and this is the next logical step So more to come  but suffice it to say we re pretty excited about what this opportunity holds for the industry OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Stephen Kim    Evercore    AnalystYeah  Thanks a lot  guys  Let me follow on Mike s question here on ICG  A number of questions  Maybe you can just sort of take them all as one  I m curious about your longer term plans    this opportunity to expand  Are you thinking that it s going to be more along the lines of these integrated systems with the mechanicals integrated and windows  Or will it be more kind of like the bare skeleton as you think about the opportunities  And can you give us a sense for an estimate of how much you think that you re saving    or they are saving    in the Jacksonville market and whether you think that that s something which can increase as you take this across the country Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Stephen  I ll take the first question as far as where we see this going in the future  and I think it s really the latter or the first piece that you mentioned  which is to take it to the level of plumbing  electrical  window installation  etc   so I think even an advanced level of manufacturing from what s readily available I think in most markets today with just the raw frame shell So  ICG is already starting to do some floor cassettes which we think is kind of in that more advanced level  offsite manufacturing  and as we look to this existing operation plus the places down the road  we think the real opportunity is to get into the more advanced manufacturing  We re certainly going to get benefits today from kind of the frame shell components of walls and trusses  but where we really see the benefit coming is in those more advanced manufacturing techniques In terms of kind of the benefits  Stephen  we certainly believe that there is benefit there  I would highlight for you that this is a kind of single plant in a single market  so any impact in our overall reported results I think will be modest  But it s a big step for the Company and a journey that we re really excited to take over the next two or three years Stephen Kim    Evercore    AnalystExcellent  Well  I know you guys have done a tremendous amount of work there  So I assume will be in probably one of the best positions to know  Second question relates to the entry level segment of the market  We highlighted this morning that there were some changes done with respect to housing policy or at least changes that looked like they re coming which could be helpful to the lower end of the market even beyond what we ve seen over the last couple of years I m curious as to whether or not you have seen any change in the entry level of the market  We know that there has been a lot of other folks moving into that segment of the market in a more serious way  and I was curious whether or not you have continued to see strength at the entry level or if you ve seen it start to moderate in any way  So just your commentary about what you re seeing in the marketplace from a    at the lower end of the market Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Stephen  it s Ryan  I ll take the first piece of that  We are seeing continued strength  and I think it s evidenced in our reported numbers for the fourth quarter on our first time entry level space  We had 57  year over year sign up growth  which is pretty robust  So  we re excited about that  We re excited about the continued investment that we ve been making over really the last two and a half years to meaningfully move the number of lots that we control that are specifically targeted to this first time space  So I like how we re positioned there Some of the changes that you speak to I think have certainly helped with the overall affordability equation in providing attractive and accessible financing to even more buyers  And I think that is all factored into the overall demand situation that we re seeing from the first time entry level buyer OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Matthew Bouley    Barclays    AnalystGood morning  Thank you for taking my questions  I wanted to ask about the move up business  Obviously  strong absorption growth there as well in the quarter and obviously many of your competitors leaning harder into the entry level  So I guess on move up  how do you think about at this point Pulte s position competitively  both in terms of land acquisition and potentially even pricing power at move up communities  Just because  simply  you don t quite hear as much about your competitors leading into that part of the business as much  Thank you Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerMatt  it s a good question and I think it highlights the reason or maybe gives me an opportunity to reiterate the balanced mix and the balanced approach that we have tried to take with our business  And if I take you back to kind of late 2016  what we started talking about was an opportunity to shift about 5 points of our business out of move up and into entry level  And you re starting to see the results in our closed home mix from that effort What that yields  just to give you some specific numbers  in the fourth quarter 43  of our sign ups were from our move up business  So it continues to be the largest piece of our business  It s a very profitable piece of our business  and it carries kind of our flagship brand of Pulte Homes  So  we like how we re positioned  We have not abandoned it at all  Rather  I think we ve more appropriately shaped the size of that business to be reflective of the market opportunity We think we ve also    the counter balance to that is that we think we ve gotten better positioned to take advantage of the first time opportunity as well  Suffice it to say  we don t have all of our eggs in any one single basket  and we like that Matthew Bouley    Barclays    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that color  And then secondly I wanted to ask on the SG A side  You re guiding to relatively flat leverage in 2020  maybe slight leverage at the midpoint  but obviously you are set up well from a backlog standpoint around revenue growth  I guess  are there any other expenses  There were some of the IT spending you were talking about last quarter that we should be aware of that might prevent some of the kind of additional SG A leverage  Thank you Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Matt  It s Bob  Obviously  when you adjust for the current year we come in around 10 8   so the range that we ve given shows some    even at the midpoint    some improvement over that  Certainly  we ve talked about over the last couple of years that we ve been on a journey on the IT side  the upgrades of our systems  As those systems get put in place  we re actually starting to depreciate them now  So we ve got some costs associated with that  So really nothing new or unusual in that  It s really just being able to leverage the increased scale of the business OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Mike Dahl    RBC    AnalystHi  great  Thanks for taking my questions  I first wanted to start with a question around kind of pricing power and the momentum in gross margins  I think  Bob  you talked about the potential for margins to improve as the year goes on  I m not sure if that was still within the construct of the full year guidance that you re giving or suggesting that there could be upside from there  But as a starting point  could you talk about just the pricing power that you ve seen  Maybe if you can give kind of percentage of communities that you ve been able to raise price  any sense of magnitude and how that compares year on year over the past few months Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Hey  Mike  Just to clarify  that improvement was included in the guide  not outside of the guide  So that s just reflecting that the range for the year actually goes a little bit higher than what we ve prepared for the first quarter In terms of pricing power  I think if you look at our ASP during the quarter it s roughly flat on an aggregate basis  But you ve actually got a decrease in the entry level  which is really a reflection of the types of assets we re providing there  There is actually    if there is any real pricing power in the market  I think it s there and I think it has been for probably the last year or two  We showed about 4  up on the move up and active adult  So I think there isn t a real substantive change in the product we re delivering So I think that gives you some insight into what the pricing power is around that  Mix always matters  what markets that comes from  all that  But on balance  I would say you ve got more power to price in the entry level although they are price sensitive  so there is a limit to how far you can push that  But we re seeing prices hold and go up a little bit in the balance of the business Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And Mike  the only other thing that I d add to that is  I think with the strength that you re seeing on the volume side    and we re starting to see some reduced inventory levels  I think certainly that would create an environment where all of the builders will have more pricing power  The thing that I think you ll see  certainly us and all builders be cautious with is the affordability equation  We all saw what happened kind of in the back half of  18 when affordability became challenged  And so pricing is one of the key levers in that mix  and I think we want to pay attention to that Mike Dahl    RBC    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  And the second question  just another follow up on ICG  And  Ryan  I appreciate that there are some things that you don t want to get into in terms of the details  But I did want to press again on just    since you will continue to have ICG serve its external customer base  what is the true differentiation to Pulte of owning the assets  Is it just the first time learnings you ve discussed  Or was this maybe more of a situation where you were an existing customer and had you not taken this position you could have lost access to them as a supplier  Or any other dynamic at play that could just kind of explain why this ends up being differentiating for you versus    there is a question  just having this be more of a partnership but still a traditional kind of customer relationship Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the opportunity here  Mike  is really twofold  Number one  we see it as a great opportunity to partner with the founders to speed up the innovation  moving from the current version of frame shell into some of the more advanced manufacturing techniques  So that s something that we ve been talking about    you ve heard us talk about really for the last two or so years that we think there is a tremendous opportunity there And then the other piece is  with 80  of our closings coming out of our commonly managed plan portfolio  we see this opportunity really applying to other parts of our business besides just what it s going to provide in the north Florida market  So that s something that we think working with the founders of ICG we can really benefit from in other parts of the country The biggest reason  Mike    and I can t overemphasize this enough    this is about labor  We have been talking about labor shortages in this industry for the last 10 years  give or take  There doesn t seem to be anything that s going to structurally change the availability of labor  and so the only logical off ramp that we see to that is getting more efficient  and one of the avenues that we think is    the easiest or the most easily accessible off ramp is to truly have a housing operation that can benefit from offsite production  And we see the unlock that it gives us on the tight labor supply as a huge benefit OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America  Go ahead  please  Your line is open John Lovallo    Bank of America    AnalystHey  guys  I thank you for taking my questions  The first one on ICG  And I think this is an incredible opportunity  and frankly we see it as the future of homebuilding  So I think this is an excellent move on your part  But ICG  it looks like they have the ability to deliver a complete fully integrated offsite solution  I mean  building information modeling  component manufacturing  installations  etc  And it looks like that you re taking kind of more of a piecemeal approach here just to start with some more prefab parts instead of going for the full solutions I guess the question is  is this just being a little bit conservative on the onset here and how quickly could you kind of pivot in the Jacksonville market to really deliver a fully integrated offsite solution Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  John  it s Ryan  We haven t given that level of detail yet  But I think what you highlight is what the real opportunity is and that s certainly what we re focused on  As I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks  the level of innovation that was existing inside of ICG is one of the things that made it really attractive  So to your point  they have design services  We re manufacturing precision components  We ve got the ability to assemble those precision components with the onsite labor And so the next logical step is some incremental investment and then to kind of systematize in a way that you can do it in a volume type setting  And so that s what the opportunity is  and certainly what we re squarely focused on John Lovallo    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  And then maybe just more of a housekeeping item here  The gross margin in the quarter  I think you guys had highlighted California incentives  warranty and inventory impairments  Anyway you can kind of bucket the impact in the quarter from each of those Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I wouldn t because none of them are individually significant  If we think they were  we would have walked you through them  I would characterize the total of it as being somewhere in the neighborhood of 14  Phonetic  basis points of margin impact on the quarter OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman   Associates  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Alan Ratner    Zelman   Associates    AnalystHey guys  good morning  Nice quarter  and congrats on the acquisition Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Alan Alan Ratner    Zelman   Associates    AnalystMy first one on ICG  just hearing your comments about some of the things and where in the future where you could see this going  especially the closed panels with the windows and the plumbing and the electrical  etc   already pre installed  One thing that we typically hear from builders is a reason why perhaps that hasn t become more mainstream is the very high transportation costs associated with that  bringing those products to the job site as well as breakage I mean  I know builders even back in the 80s and 90s were experimenting with that stuff  installing windows and things  So is there anything that ICG has done that kind of has cracked the code to make that process more efficient and affordable from a building perspective that the math actually makes sense now  Or is that just something that you think you ve got the right team in place to pursue that but perhaps you re not quite there yet Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Alan  thanks for the question  I appreciate it  As we mentioned today  what s coming out of ICG are the wall panels  the floor cassettes and manufactured trusses  We think there is an opportunity to go to the closed wall panels  inclusive of windows  electrical plumbing  etc  Work and investment has got to be done on that  I think you highlight the challenge that applies to all offsite manufacturing  not just kind of the second stage  and its transportation And so what that means is that you ve got to have enough volume within a relatively close proximity such that the transportation costs don t offset the savings that you get from building those components in a more efficient way  So  work to be done  investment to be done to figure that out  It has been done in other places in other applications  and so we think that the ability to do it is there And then  I think the next logical question is  well  why is this time going to be different  And it goes back to the question that I answered a few back  which is labor  And we just don t see labor rates going in a direction that will challenge the efficiencies that are gained from the manufacturing environment  which has happened in the past  but because of what I think is going to be a persistent shortage of labor  we really view this as a new opportunity to do something different Alan Ratner    Zelman   Associates    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  Ryan  And second question  maybe for Bob  Just kind of thinking about the capital allocation thinking at this point here  your net debt to cap is at the lowest level we ve seen in many years  and at the same time buybacks decelerated this quarter and then for the year were down fairly meaningfully from the prior few years  So how are you thinking about the balance sheet  the capital allocation at this point  Is there another kind of use of that cash that s being earmarked at this point  or is it a function of where the stock price is  And any commentary you can give there Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  It s going to sound a little bit redundant and boring but it s kind of the same playbook we ve been working from for the last several years  We pulled every lever this year  We bought stock  we increased our dividend  we retired some debt  we ve invested in the business  We ve indicated we ll be investing more this year  Obviously  we ve got an investment we just made in ICG  And I think you ll continue to see all of those things be in our windshield We obviously expect pretty strong cash generation in fiscal  20  What we ve highlighted and been consistent with I think is we ll report the news on the share repurchase activity  but I think any and all of those are still run of mine but nothing new or different to report beyond that OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Jack Micenko    SIG    AnalystHi  good morning  First one  a little bit bigger picture for Ryan  Thinking about this pivot toward the entry level    and it seems this may be occurring a little bit faster than maybe you d expect the success or the uptick    on the entry level side  you ve got a real gamut of competition  You ve got bare bones product  you ve got everything included on the other end and then somewhere between  you ve got built to order  Curious how you see Pulte really positioning and competing in entry level from a product standpoint as that business gets to be a bigger part of your mix Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Good morning  Jack  I appreciate the question  You are going to see us play on the higher end of the entry level price point  We have made some modifications to our typical built to order model and you heard that in Bob s prepared comments that we are building more specs in that business to kind of meet the demand that s there  And so you saw a little bit of an uptick in our specs as a percentage of total inventory  and it s largely reflective of more specs in that entry level business We are limiting the choice within our Centex model to drive some of the efficiencies that we are in turn passing on to the consumer which really creates the affordability and the value that the first time buyer desires  So less choice  less ability to customize  but you re getting a really nice home and a lot of home for the money  and we think that s where the magic is  We ll continue to deliver the great customer experience  the high quality    the quality location of community that I think all of our brands have been known for I don t think you ll    well  you won t see us probably go with the bare bones model  the really small square footage model  We just don t think that s part of the offering that we give to the consumer Jack Micenko    SIG    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  And then that 5 points of pivot  Given the uptake that you ve seen in    I think last quarter you said that the margins in the entry were healthier perhaps than the move up  And does that 5 point number expand  leaving the door open for that to expand  Or you can say  hey  look  we want to be a balanced business and a third of the book is all we really want on the entry side Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Jack  I think that the key message that I d emphasize is we want a balanced business  I think you ll see it maybe    it may go down a few points  it may go up a few points as opportunities arise  Our overall focus is going to continue to be to drive through cycle return on investment within the residential housing space  And so  as we see trends emerge  we ll certainly take opportunities where they present themselves  But  with the focus on being more balanced  I don t think you re going to see us place outsize bets in anticipation of some future trend  So  we re pretty close to probably where we want to be  is probably the message that I d leave with you And as far as margins go  to your other question  we like the margin profile that we re getting out of the entry level space  They are attractive margins  and it s really reflective of what Bob shared which is  that s the place where we ve seen the ability to get some price expansion  What I would emphasize  Jack  to the comment I made a minute ago about our focus is on return  we really look at the underwriting of that business as the same as we look at move up and the same as we look at active adult  So  certainly gross margins are part of the story  but the real prize is return on invested capital  and we look at all of our consumer segments the same when it comes to return OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Ken Zener    KeyBanc    AnalystGood morning  gentlemen Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerKen Ken Zener    KeyBanc    AnalystSo your entry level    a few years ago  people were so concerned around the Del Webb  You seem to be putting that to rest  My question is this  If you re moving in entry because that s where demand is  it makes sense  you re building more spec homes  Why is that approach given your hesitancy to do it in other categories  What is the risk return that you re seeing there  Is it because you re controlling more labor like some other builders I ve talked to  What is it that gets you over that risk profile that you have for your other categories in short Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Ken  It s Ryan  Risk is just part of it  It s really about value in the eyes of the consumer  And so  as we ve looked at what the consumer is willing to pay for  we believe that we re more efficient  more profitable and manage risk better with the move up and active adult buyer when they get the opportunity to choose the things that they value  And that s part of our strategic pricing model that has contributed to the margin profile that we have today that we re very proud of We think with this entry level consumer  they value different things  and affordability and access is probably the biggest driver  And so by limiting the amount of choice that we give  building a few more specs  having those homes quicker to deliver    because this buyer  in theory  is coming out of an apartment  they just operate on a little bit different buying cycle than our move up and our active adult buyer  And so it s less about risk and more about maximizing value and given the consumer  the things that they want and need Ken Zener    KeyBanc    AnalystUnderstood  I think it s a good move  Second question  Could you expand a little bit since you mentioned it as the gross margin drag with California  Could you just talk about it being north  south  coastal  inland  etc  Just give us your perspective since that was something you called out specifically  Thank you very much Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Ken  I think California as a whole  it s been no secret  has been a drag and has had    it s been a tougher selling environment for really the last 12 months  south and north  coastal and inland  In order of severity  I think Northern California Coastal probably being the hardest hit and the slowest  It also happens to be the place where we re starting to see some strength start to come back into the market  and so we re cautiously optimistic as we ve got a very strong business or a nicely positioned business in Northern California  in the Bay Area in particular  So  probably the drag more on discounts and incentives that were given to continue to sell homes in Northern California over the last 12 months OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystHi  Good morning  guys  Thanks for taking my questions  First  just wanted to follow up on the move up market  get a little bit more color on that  Our field research recently has revealed a healthy move up market  which I ll just say has been ahead of our expectations  quite frankly  But what do you really think is driving that  Is it lower rates kind of breaking up the prior rate lock  Are you starting to see the leading edge and the millennials purchase in earnest in the move up market  Really what do you think is driving that improvement Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think like everything else  it is the health of the economy  first and foremost  So you ve got wage inflation  you have relatively slower price appreciation there  Rate certainly helps  if it s benefiting  So all those things coupled together  One of the earlier questions talked about sort of the big move for a lot of the builders to the entry level  which has to a degree thinned out the competitive set  So supply is in pretty good shape both from a new build perspective  and we ve got a healthy supply in just about every market where we re operating today in terms of days on market for resale  which is our biggest competitor So I think all those things together have lent themselves to a pretty nice business for us  29  absorption increase  4  price appreciation is pretty nice  So we like the business  and I ll parrot what Ryan said earlier  It s the reason we re not making a big bet one way or the other  We think through time being able to serve in each of the markets where we operate the set of consumers that are there  and it s going to be different for instance in some parts of Florida than what it is in some parts of the Midwest  right  so that we re looking at each market and investing to serve a balanced portfolio in the market where we re operating Truman Patterson    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  Okay  I absolutely agree with that  On the cost inflation outlook for 2020    I know you guys mentioned 1  stick and brick was likely to occur  what you were expecting  Could you just break up your outlook for land  labor and materials and whether or not you think this accelerates versus 2019 Robert T  O Shaughnessy    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  it s interesting  On the land side    it s a competitive market  You ve heard us say this before  It always is  I think you ll see certain parts of the country and certain asset classes be more competitive than others  But I think we re going to see continued land pressure  We see it in the land coming through and closings today  And I don t think land is on sale In terms of the labor and materials  on the material side  we ve got a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year  reflective of the decreasing price of lumber and lumber package in the back half of last year which will affect our closings now  But we ve seen lumber tick up a little bit  Not bad  but a little bit  So we think that will moderate through the year  All the other real    other than concrete  which is always local to a market  we see a pretty benign material inflation rate Labor is    as you ve heard us talk about and the reason for the ICG investment is always a little bit of a wildcard    it s been better the last 12 months  And so our expectation is that we don t see a lot of pressure on labor rate  That s going to vary by market  But obviously we think about 1  up overall  Once again  that s going to largely be labor  just given the way the materials market is behaving OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG  Go ahead  please  Your line is open Carl Reichardt    BTIG    AnalystThanks  Good morning  guys  Jack and Truman got a couple of mine  So I just have one for you  With move ups looking better  first time mix has moved that way that the old cruise ship Del Webb stuff has kind of come off  I m curious what you re thinking about inventory turns in the next couple of  three years  How important that metric is to you  You turn your inventory about out one time a year by my numbers  Are you expecting that to pick up meaningfully and how important is that metric to you as a driver of returns Ryan R  Marshall    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Carl  look  it s a big driver of return  And so    I think the way that we look at inventory turns is  breaking down what do you get on the house side and what do we get on the land side  With 80 some odd percent of our balance sheet being in land  that s the lever that can really move the needle on overall inventory turns  and it s a big reason why you ve heard us talk about doing shorter duration land deals with more options because it drives right at the heart of the inventory turn equation  So the hope would be that we can continue to grow that as we roll in more options  as we roll off some of the cruise ship Del Webbs that you mentioned  we d look for opportunity to accelerate our land inventory turn On the house side  that s a balance between really cycle time  how much labor is available and delivering a high quality product  And I think it s another reason why we ve made the investment in ICG is because it speaks to all of those  You ve got an opportunity to build with more precise components that aren t sitting out in the rain and the snow  You ve got the ability of the BIM modeling and some of the technology that factors into that  And we think we can cut cycle time as well  So we think there is an opportunity to kind of pull all the levers there with more efficient labor  higher quality materials  being more cost efficient  So we think there s a lot of goodness Carl Reichardt    BTIG    AnalystGreat  I appreciate that  Ryan  Thanks OperatorHello  ladies and gentlemen  that s all the time for questions that we have today  So I d like to turn the call back to Jim Zeumer for some closing remarks James P  Zeumer    Vice President  Investor Relations and Corporate CommunicationsGreat

197005,418521,PHM,A Big Acquisition Overshadows PulteGroup s Q4 Earnings Weakness,news,"Residential homebuilder PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  reported Q4 and full year 2019 earnings on January 28  Results were mixed  with strong order numbers balanced against poor adjusted quarterly income and earnings numbers   
The market didn t seem to know what to make of the results  Shares  which opened slightly higher  plunged 3  as the market had its first glance at the numbers  However  they immediately rebounded  recouping all of their losses and then some as investors digested the big news from the earnings report  Pulte is acquiring Jacksonville based Innovative Construction Group  ICG   an offsite manufacturer of framing shells  By the end of the day  shares were up a healthy 6 4  
Here s why this seemingly small purchase overshadowed the underwhelming numbers 

By the numbers

YOY   year over year  EPS   earnings per share  Data source  PulteGroup  Inc  earnings releases  Chart by author 
Annual numbers  including revenue  net income  and average selling price per unit  were essentially flat year over year  The exceptions were diluted EPS  which was up 3 1   and new orders  which rose 9 4   thanks in large part to the big Q4 increase 
Look who s buying
Growth in orders  both during the quarter and for the year  was strongest in Texas and the company s West region  which includes California  According to CFO Robert O Shaughnessy on the Q4 earnings call  though  the most important factor in the big orders growth wasn t where people were buying  but who was buying  first time homebuyers  
Pulte divides its residential home offerings into three categories 

 First time  or  starter  homes  which are smaller  less expensive  and geared toward younger homebuyers 
 Move up  homes  which are larger and more expensive to accommodate growing families and higher budgets 
 Active adult  homes  located in communities that focus on senior citizens 

In April 2019  Pulte indicated that it was changing its strategy  which had been geared toward the  move up  and  active adult  markets  Instead  Pulte would target more  first time  homebuyers with offerings at lower price points  Indeed  on the call  O Shaughnessy referenced  the ongoing and purposeful expansion of our entry level business  particularly in the Southeast  Florida  and Texas   an effort which  according to him  seems to be paying off 

For the quarter  our first time buyer orders increased 57  to 1 743 homes     while pricing for first time homes decreased by 8  to  342 000      This successful expansion of our first time business is also demonstrated in the mix of our fourth quarter closings  By buyer group  closings in the quarter were comprised of 32  first time  45  move up  and 23  active adult as compared with 26  first time  47  move up  and 27  active adult in the fourth quarter last year      Given the increased investment we have been making in assets that serve this buyer group  we believe we are well positioned to continue expanding this element of our business 

Fast  cheap  and good
Of course  an 8  decrease in pricing in a company s hottest product isn t necessarily a good thing  But that s where the company s other announcement comes in  the purchase of offsite builder ICG 
Based in Jacksonville  ICG primarily pre assembles wooden wall frames and roof trusses  which are then delivered to construction sites in lieu of crews building them onsite  This can save valuable time on construction sites and reduce overall costs  especially labor costs 
However  what s especially exciting to Pulte s management is the prospect of branching out into additional offsite construction  CEO Ryan Marshall noted that ICG also offers pre assembled floor systems and wants to look into expanding ICG s scope to include  installed windows and wall prep for mechanical  electrical  and plumbing  
He went on to add 

This acquisition has the potential to benefit our Jacksonville operations through faster cycle times  precision structural components and savings on lumber and other materials  More importantly  we see this facility as a model for integrating increased offsite production in other PulteGroup divisions  While likely a few years down the road  the opportunity is there to develop comparable production plants in areas where our scale in adjacent markets can support a dedicated factory 

In other words  Pulte is doubling down on its focus on first time homebuyers and is looking for ways to cut costs to be able to make more money while keeping its price point affordable  This is something of a gamble  and as Q4 s results showed  in the short term  it may result in lower  or  as in Q4  nonexistent  revenue and net income growth  But management should be applauded for picking a strategy it believes can win over the long term and doubling down on it  Smart investors should keep an eye on Pulte to see if its new strategy can lead it to outperformance ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pph09,2073043
197006,418522,PHM,Is PulteGroup a Buy on Strong Order Growth ,news,"PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  announced fourth quarter earnings and guidance that beat Wall Street estimates and sent the stock up 6   At first glance  the numbers seem like nothing special  Revenue growth was unspectacular at 1 4   driven by a 2  increase in unit growth and a drop in average selling prices  Adjusted earnings per share rose  but primarily due to a lower share count 
So why all the hoopla  Order growth 

A steep increase in orders outweighs flat growth
Pulte reported a 33  increase in orders to 5 629 units  from a depressed prior year level of 4 267  The dollar value of new orders rose 35  to  2 5 billion  Backlog increased 20  to 10 507 units or about  4 5 billion  Finally  foot traffic was up 14  
The fourth quarter has historically been a seasonally slow period for the real estate industry in general  as buyers tend to move based on the school year  Some builders have even noted that the seasonal slowdown builders typically see in the fourth quarter never materialized  Management noted that the strength was across all geographies and products 

Data source  PulteGroup 
The first time homebuyer is becoming a bigger part of the business
Pulte announced an adjustment in its product mix to increase its share of starter homes  Pulte s bread and butter has historically been the move up homebuyer  but there is such pent up demand in the first time homebuyer demographic that just about everyone is allocating more resources there  Pulte s niche will be the more expensive first time homebuyer properties  which fit more naturally with its core move up buyer 
First time homebuyers accounted for 32  of Pulte s unit volume in the fourth quarter  which is about in line with national averages  In terms of order growth  Pulte saw increases across the board  however  the first time homebuyer segment grew 57   compared to a 27  increase for move up and a 22  increase for active adults 
Can manufacturing techniques control costs and boost margins 
The company also announced an acquisition of Innovative Construction Group  ICG   which is an offsite manufacturer of component parts for houses  such as framing  roof trusses  wall panels  and floor systems While offsite construction is not necessarily a new idea  it dates back to the 1980s   it never really caught on due to high transportation costs and breakage 
The rationale was labor  Construction workers are hard to find these days  especially skilled construction labor  This purchase is a way to streamline the process  and hopefully allow the company to lower construction costs and increase efficiencies  Pulte doesn t envision the acquisition making an immediate impact on earnings    it will be more of a learning exercise at first before a nationwide roll out 
The homebuilding sector has the wind at its back
After homebuilders under built for most of the post bubble recovery  the supply demand imbalance is stark  Policy makers are struggling to find levers to encourage more home construction  and the demographics are supportive as the millennial generation enters its prime homebuying years 
Historically  homebuilding has been a highly cyclical  feast or famine business  and homebuilder stocks have behaved accordingly  Typically  they trade at lower price to earnings ratios during boom periods  since investors invariably fret that a recession could be around the corner  But with Pulte trading at 10 8 times expected 2020 earnings  it seems that the market isn t giving it credit for what should be a multiyear boom in the entire homebuilding sector  One way to play that would be to buy the SPDR S P Homebuilder ETF  NYSEMKT XHB   however the index includes non homebuilding stocks  Pulte is one of the leaders in the sector and would make a good investment for someone who wants a pure play on housing  along with some potential upside if the ICG merger and offsite manufacturing bears fruit ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps0id,2078071

197021,418537,PHM,Low Mortgage Rates To Boost Housing Market  5 Stocks To Buy,opinion,The Federal Reserve s three consecutive interest rate cuts during the second half of last year and decision to hold rates steadily throughout 2020 have aided the U S  housing market Moreover  in the last few weeks  fears about the coronavirus pandemic made investors rush for treasury bonds as a safe haven

s Analyst Blog  January Jobs Data Validates Strength in Labor Market  5 PicksThe non farm payroll data for January has reaffirmed the robustness of the U S  labor market barring some minor fluctuations  Notably  the labor market has been the best driving force for the historically longest expansion of the U S  economy  which is growing for more than eleven and half years  Notably  the

2 000 to 147 000  Consequently  the economy added more than 211 000 jobs on average in the past three months The unemployment rate increased slightly from 3 5  to 3 6   primarily due to 0 2  increase in labor force participation rate  which stood at 63 4  in January   its highest level since June 2013  Moreover  the average hourly wage rate grew 0 3  in January  in line with the consensus estimates  Average wage rate improved 3 1  year over year  reflecting the 18th successive month of 3  or above wage rate growth  In another report on Feb 6  the Department of Labor reported that non

300  1 400 and 1 000 jobs Among the sectors that gained jobs in January  the construction sector is the most important one  The U S  housing market witnessed an uptick in second half 2019  due to the Federal Reserve s three consecutive interest rates cuts from July to September  With interest rates low  mortgage rates also remain low  which in turn helps consumers to borrow more easily  Notably  the housing market constitutes around 3  of the U S  GDP The Association of Equipment Manufacturers has estimated that the U S  construction market will grow 1 5 2  between the period of 2020 to 2025

197038,418554,PHM,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook PulteGroup  PHM ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank

Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this homebuilder a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for PulteGroup is 32 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 13 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 12 2  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  PulteGroup has an S TA ratio of 0 99  which means that the company gets  0 99 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 97  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And PulteGroup is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 3  this year versus the industry average of 4 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for PulteGroup  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 28  2020  PulteGroup reported EPS of  1 14 versus consensus estimate of  1 08 
For the current fiscal year  PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of  3 91 per share on  10 96 billion in revenues  This represents a 12 03  change in EPS on a 7 27  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 21 per share on  11 59 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 81  and 5 82   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
PulteGroup may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
PulteGroup has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12X versus its peer group s average of 9 9X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 45  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to consider the stock s Zacks Rank  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if PulteGroup passes the test  Thus  it seems as though PulteGroup shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pultegroup-phm-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200502657,200502657
197051,418567,PHM,PulteGroup  PHM  Is Up 4 59  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PHM that show why this homebuilder shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For PHM  shares are up 4 59  over the past week while the Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry is up 4 25  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 18 58  compares favorably with the industry s 13 65  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of PulteGroup have risen 18 49   and are up 68 91  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 8 27  and 26 25   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to PHM s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  PHM is currently averaging 3 582 805 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with PHM 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost PHM s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 90 to  3 96 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that PHM is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep PulteGroup on your short list ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pultegroup-phm-is-up-459-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200503331,200503331

Zacks Industry Rank with the 11th spot out of more than 250 spaces And one of the biggest reasons for the success is PulteGroup  PHM   which has gained more than 50  this year and has put together 12 straight quarters of positive surprises It reported third quarter earnings per share of  1 01 late last month  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 10   The company hasn t missed in over 4 years The past four quarters have seen an average surprise of more than 10  Total revenues climbed to  2 7 billion  or 2 3  better than last year and more than 4  atop our expectations Orders jumped 13  with growth across all buyer groups and reporting segments  It s the largest percentage increase since the end of 2017  showing how this company  and its space  is recovering from a rough second half of 2018 One of PHM s strengths is its focus on first time or entry level buyers  A low interest rate environment is great  but it also takes lower priced homes to convince younger potential buyers to make a move  literally and figuratively  It s been working for PHM  as 31  of orders and 29  of closings in the third quarter were first timers  Also  the 13  growth in orders included a 39  surge in first time buyer orders Earnings estimates have been on the rise since the quarterly report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is up 3 5  in the past 30 days to  3 54 As for next year  analysts have boosted earnings by 5 1  in that time to  3 91  Therefore  we currently expect 10 5  growth for 2020 over 2019 Crocs  CROX You can t keep an ugly shoe down  Especially when its comfortable and just old enough to be considered retro by teenagers Such is the case right now for Crocs  CROX   which is in the midst of its second renaissance of the past 20 years as kids are loving the therapeutic look once again while the older folks get to pretend that they re still cool  if they ever were in the first place  The company jumped more than 36  this year and has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 10 of the last 11 quarters Late last month  CROX posted earnings per share of 57 cents for the third quarter  which stomped last year s 7 cents and topped our consensus by 39  It was the seventh straight quarter with a beat  amassing an average surprise of 38  over the past four Revenue jumped nearly 20  from last year to  312 8 million  The result also eclipsed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 3  The first wave was a fad  and we all knew it at the time  But this new resurgence feels more substantial as CROX is a much better run company these days and has diversified away from its classic clog offering Revenue for 2019 is expected to grow 11  to 12  over 2008  which would mark record annual sales for the company  Revenue for 2020 is then expected to grow an additional 12  to 14  over this year Earnings estimates are reflecting this growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is up 12 5  in the past 30 days to  1 62 per share Analysts have boosted next year s consensus by nearly 33  in that time to  2 10 per share  In other words  earnings are expected to grow nearly 30  in 2020 over 2019  Now that s way more than a fad Fortinet  FTNT When an investor talks about security  he or she probably doesn t mean house alarms and mall cops  It s all about cybersecurity these days  which is the Top 4  of the Zacks Industry Rank with a year to date gain of 25  By the way  we just call the space  Security   no  cyber  needed According to Gartner  worldwide spending on IT security is expected to grow 10 5  in 2019 from  114 billion last year Fortinet  FTNT  plans to get a good sized piece of that action  The company provides network security appliances and Unified Threat Management  UTM  network security solutions to enterprises  service providers and government entities worldwide Shares of the company have climbed more than 42  so far this year  which easily beats its highly ranked industry FTNT has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 13 straight quarters  Late last month  it reported earnings per share of 67 cents for its third quarter  which improved upon last year s 44 cents and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 20  If you average all of its positive surprises over the past four quarters  it comes to a little over 18  Revenue jumped 21  from last year to  548 million  which also topped our expectations  This performance was driven by strong growth in Fortinet Security Fabric  cloud and SD WAN offerings FTNT has a lot of potential pushing forward  especially product launches  deal wins  strategic acquisitions and  of course  that strong industry  Therefore  it makes sense that the company would raise its outlook for 2019 It now expects revenue between  2 135 billion and  2 15 billion this year  instead of  2 1 billion to  2 12 billion  Earnings are now seen at  2 39 to  2 41  compared to the prior outlook of  2 23 to  2 26 Based on the strong quarter  positive outlook and solid space  analysts have raised their expectations in the past 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year is up 6 7  in that time to  2 40 For 2020  we re expecting  2 64 per share  which is up 7 3  from a month ago and suggests year over year growth of 10

197127,418643,PHM,Is PulteGroup  PHM  Stock A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PulteGroup has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 86  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 54  If we focus on the long term PE trend  PulteGroup s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 10 38  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that PulteGroup has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 30  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates indicate that the company s share price will likely appreciate in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PulteGroup has a P S ratio of about 0 96  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 27 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  PHM is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PulteGroup a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though PulteGroup might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives PHM a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  if we look at the company s recent earnings estimates  the current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and four downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PulteGroup  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though PulteGroup has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePulteGroup is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a solid industry rank  among the Top 12    PulteGroup looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this stock a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleZacks experts released their picks to gain  100  or more in 2020  One is a famous cutting edge food company that is  hiding in plain sight

197147,418663,PHM,Why PulteGroup  PHM  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Home Builders industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This homebuilder has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 13 68  
For the last reported quarter  PulteGroup came out with earnings of  0 59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 47 per share  representing a surprise of 25 53   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 09 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 11 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 83  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for PulteGroup  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PulteGroup currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 84   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 23  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pultegroup-phm-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200440234,200440234
197148,418664,PHM,PulteGroup  PHM  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 47 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PulteGroup 
For PulteGroup  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 84  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that PulteGroup will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PulteGroup would post earnings of  0 47 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  25 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PulteGroup appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pultegroup-phm-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200440161,200440161

197165,418681,PHM,Shares in Pulte Group inch up after James Grosfeld resigns from Board,news,"Investing com    Shares in PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  inched up on Tuesday in after hours trading after board member James Grosfeld announced his resignation from the Board of Directors in the latest setback for the embattled homebuilder  
The nation s third largest homebuilder is currently embroiled in a bitter fight between company founder William Pulte and CEO Richard Dugas over the direction of the company  Last week  Dugas announced plans to resign later next year due to irreconcilable differences with Pulte  Tensions between the two executives reached a boiling point in recent days  as Dugas has expressed extreme discontent with the company s stock price  which has tumbled 20  over the last 12 months  The dispute stems from a decision by the Dugas led company to move its headquarters from Detroit to Atlanta two years ago  
 In my opinion  for the Board of Directors to even consider letting Richard Dugas stay another year as a lame duck CEO puts the personal interests of Richard Dugas ahead of the interests of the company and works to the detriment of the shareholders  the employees  and our customers  who are watching a board protect a failed CEO   Pulte said in a statement on Monday  
Grosfeld  who served as the CEO of Pulte Holmes for more than 15 years beginning in 1974  has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1997  Grosfeld  78  is also a member of the Board of Directors at BlackRock and a trustee of Lexington Realty Trust since 2003  Grosfeld had served as an independent director with Pulte Group since early December 
Grosfeld wrote in a letter to the U S  Securities and Exchange  SEC  Commission on Tuesday that since the Board last met on March 22 he has been  excluded from a number of subsequent meetings  and therefore  sees  no useful purpose of remaining on the Board

197166,418682,PHM,Aecom  ACM  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of AECOM  ACM   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  35 76 in the previous session  AECOM has gained 32 7  since the start of the year compared to the 23 9  move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 19 8  return for the Zacks Engineering   R and D Services industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 8  2019  Aecom reported EPS of  0 69 versus consensus estimate of  0 61 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3 2  
For the current fiscal year  Aecom is expected to post earnings of  2 78 per share on  20 65 billion in revenues  This represents a 3 73  change in EPS on a 2 46  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  3 18 per share on  21 13 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 14 57  and 2 32   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Aecom may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Aecom has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8X versus its peer group s average of 10 2X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Aecom currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Aecom meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Aecom shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Aecom Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Aecom have been rising  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also looking good  including Quanta Services  NYSE PWR   PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   and NVR  NVR   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Aecom  Still  the fundamentals for Aecom are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-06-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aecom-acm-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200432565,200432565

197193,418709,PHM,U S  new home sales at six year high  recovery still fragile,news,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    Sales of new U S  single family homes rose to a six year high in September  but a sharp downward revision to August s sales pace indicated the housing recovery remains tentative 
The Commerce Department said on Friday that sales increased 0 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467 000 units  the highest reading since July 2008  August s sales rate was revised down to 466 000 units from 504 000 units 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales at a 470 000 unit pace last month 
U S  Treasury debt prices held on to gains after the data  U S  stocks were slightly up  while the dollar edged down against the euro 
The housing sector index  HGX  was down 0 78 percent  U S  homebuilder PulteGroup Inc  N PHM   which on Thursday reported a 4 percent rise in quarterly revenue from home sales  was trading more than 1 percent lower 
 We expect the housing market recovery to remain relatively gradual over the coming months   said Gennadiy Goldberg  an economist at TD Securities in New York 
New home sales  which account for about 8 percent of the housing market  tend to be volatile month to month and large revisions are not unusual  Compared to September last year  sales were up 17 percent 
Housing is slowly regaining its footing after activity stalled in the second half of 2013 as mortgage rates soared  With the 30 year fixed mortgage rate falling this week to its lowest level since June of last year  sales could pick up 
Mortgage rates have declined in tandem with a sharp fall in U S  Treasury debt yields as slowing global growth and a sharp sell off in international stock markets prompted traders to push back expectations for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve 
Slow wage growth  however  remains a constraint for an acceleration in home sales  Data this week showed sales of previously owned homes touched a one year high in September 
Last month  new home sales fell 8 9 percent in the West  handing back some of August s 28 1 percent surge  In the populous South  sales rose 2 0 percent  while they increased 12 3 percent in the Midwest  Sales were flat in the Northeast 
With sales rising modestly  the stock of new houses available on the market rose 1 5 percent to the highest level since July 2010  Builders have been ramping up construction and the improvement in inventory should provide buyers with more choices and temper house price increases 
At September s sales pace it would take 5 3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market  unchanged from August  Six months  supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand 

The median new home price fell 4 0 percent to  259 000 from a year ago

Here Are 5 Stocks with Remarkable Relative Price Strength
Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock s ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also essential in determining whether a stock s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average 
If a stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong 
It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning 
Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy 
Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains

 NEW YORK  Aug 4  Reuters    U S  stock futures fell on
Tuesday as caution prevailed ahead of reports on June personal
income data and pending home sales  a day after Wall Street
rallied to a fresh nine month closing high 
 Investors are looking for more definitive clues about the
economic recovery prospects after a spate of corporate earnings
helped spur hopes that the recession is abating 
 But some profit taking was likely to set in  as in European
markets  where bank stocks weighed following a solid run up
over the past few weeks after UBS AG  a major bank  reported a
large second quarter loss 
  The market is obviously pausing for a profit taking after

percent in June after a 0 3 percent gain in May  Personal
income is forecast to have fallen by 1 percent in June from a

government stimulus money 
 The median of forecasts from economists polled by Reuters
is for June pending home sales to have risen by 0 6 percent

it will be the fifth straight monthly gain

197211,418727,PHM,Earnings Preview  PulteGroup  PHM  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"PulteGroup  NYSE PHM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 97 billion  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PulteGroup 
For PulteGroup  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PulteGroup will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PulteGroup would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 11  delivering a surprise of  1 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PulteGroup doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-pultegroup-phm-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200407231,200407231

better than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2018  The decline is due to lower contribution from its Composites and Roofing business  along with tepid outlook for 2019 The company reported adjusted earnings of  1 38 per share in the fourth quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 by 7   Also  net sales of  1 72 billion surpassed analysts  expectation of  1 68 billion by 2 4  in the reported quarter Owens Corning Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The company s adjusted earnings increased 24 3  year over year due to solid pricing momentum  offsetting inflationary and transportation cost pressure Its top line grew 7  on a year over year basis  courtesy of contributions from Insulation acquisitions  as well as successful pricing actions in both Roofing and

taxes  EBIT  margin contracted 300 basis points  bps  to 12   The downside was mainly due to lower volumes in several core markets The Roofing segment s net sales dipped 3  year over year to  546 million  EBIT margin fell 400 bps to 15  in the quarter  The weaker performance in the segment was due to reduced growth in the U S  asphalt shingle market  The positives from remodeling and new construction markets were more than offset by lower storm demand Nonetheless  net sales from the Insulation segment came in at  732 million  up 23  year over year  EBIT margin in the quarter under review also surged 300 bps to 16   The upside was driven by the acquisition of Paroc and price improvement of  128 million  mainly in the North American residential fiberglass insulation business Operating HighlightsDuring the fourth quarter  Owens Corning s adjusted EBIT increased 6  to  228 million from  215 million in the year ago period  However  adjusted EBIT margin declined 20 bps to 13

Insulation business Insulation segment s net sales grew an impressive 36   adding 38 5  to total net sales  However  net sales from both Composites and Roofing segment declined 1  and 2   respectively Full Year 2019 OutlookIn Roofing  the company expects the U S  asphalt shingle end market to be relatively flat on slightly lower industry shipments  assuming average storm demand  Moreover  it anticipates favorable geographic mix along with a higher share of shipments In Composites  it expects growth in the glass fiber market  consistent with global industrial production improvement  The company projects increased volume and improved operating performance  However  higher inflation is likely to hamper its positive performance In Insulation  the company s expectation for the North America residential fiberglass insulation business is in line with the prior year  It anticipates continued positive pricing momentum to be offset by lower volumes and production curtailments   In the technical and other building insulation units  earnings are likely to grow on improved operating performance  and global construction and industrial insulation markets Owens Corning estimates an

take a look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is currently pegged at  1 09 per share  having declined 0 9  over the past 30 days  Nevertheless  the said figure reflects an increase of 28 2  from the year ago earnings of 85 cents per share  Revenues are expected to be  2 93 billion  up 4 7  year over year Let s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementPulteGroup s annual land acquisition strategies bode well for the company s overall top line performance  as is evident from its nine month revenue growth figure of 24 3   The company s land acquisition strategy stresses on investing in shorter lived smaller land assets and increasing land options  thereby mitigating market risk  Notably  its land sale revenues grew an impressive 163  year over year in the first nine months of 2018  The company remains optimistic about land acquisition spend  which is likely to enable it to grow nearly 10  in full year 2018 That said  affordability concerns and gradually rising mortgage rates are plaguing the U S  housing industry of late  Although buyers  interest remains high  rising interest rates and affordability concerns mar the growth prospects of the company  Meanwhile  rising land  labor and material costs are also a major cause of concern  These ongoing market headwinds are expected to have impacted the quarter to be reported Nonetheless  the company remains positive on ongoing traffic trends  Notably  buyer traffic increased year over year to 15  in the last reported quarter  This indicates higher inclination of buyers  It continues to experience strong demand  courtesy of solid economic fundamentals and financing availability  For the to be reported quarter  the company expects deliveries to increase within 6 500 6 800 homes from 6 632 in the year ago period  Moreover  the consensus estimate for fourth quarter deliveries is pegged at  6 67 billion  up 0 6  year over year The consensus estimate for Homebuilding revenues of  2 85 billion also reflects growth from  2 74 billion a year ago and  2 6 billion in the last reported quarter  The consensus mark for Financial Services revenues of  60 million also reflects a year over year increase of 7 1  Meanwhile  PulteGroup has undertaken various cost saving initiatives to improve operating and financial performance  These initiatives include improving overhead leverage  increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies  which are expected to boost profits in the quarter to be reported Homebuilding SG A expenses  as a percentage of home sale revenues  contracted 190 basis points  bps  over the last three quarters  Also  adjusted gross margin increased 310 bps in the said period Considering higher revenue expectation as well as prudent cost saving initiatives  the company s bottom line is expected to increase significantly in the soon to be reported quarter What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not show that PulteGroup is likely to beat estimates in the quarter to be reported  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Earnings ESP

What s Next for PulteGroup 
While PulteGroup has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Toll Brothers and PulteGroup are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  This means that TOL s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
TOL currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 84  while PHM has a forward P E of 8 57  We also note that TOL has a PEG ratio of 0 50  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PHM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 27 
Another notable valuation metric for TOL is its P B ratio of 1 15  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  PHM has a P B of 1 57 
These metrics  and several others  help TOL earn a Value grade of A  while PHM has been given a Value grade of C 
TOL sticks out from PHM in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that TOL is the better option right now ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tol-vs-phm-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200384316,200384316

197235,418751,PHM,Pulte Homes  Staying Confident Despite Challenging Operating Conditions,opinion,"PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  reported Q3 2018 earnings on October 23rd  The stock responded favorably with a 7 3  one day gain  That same day  the S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   gapped down and sold off for four more trading days  The index now sits at a near 7 month low while PHM is holding an impressive 24 1  total post earnings gain  This relative out performance is consistent with the seasonal strength of home builders  running from November to March   but the behavior is quite contrary to the habitual post earnings selling the plagued home builders for much of the year  Even after the market returned to post earnings punishment in response to earnings from KB Home  KBH   PHM recovered all its sympathy losses and then some the very next trading day  Together  these performances make PHM one of my prime targets for buying into the seasonal trade on home builders  I now own shares  and I am looking to accumulate call options 

Q3 earnings helped Pulte Homes  PHM  carve out a V shaped bottom from a 22 month low 
The headline numbers in the earnings report showed strong financial performance 

 For the quarter  the Company reported net income of  290 million  or  1 01 per share compared with prior year net income of  178 million  or  0 58 per share  The higher net income for the period was primarily the result of a 25  increase in homebuilding revenues  in combination with a 190 basis point expansion of operating margin  

PHM tried to address growing concerns about the housing market head on and assuage those fears 

 While buyer concerns around affordability and rising mortgage rates appear to have impacted near term market dynamics  traffic trends indicate that buyer interest levels are still high and that the overall housing recovery remains on track  

We now know the commentary on traffic trends directly contradicts the sentiment of builders in general in November  so this part of PHM s confidence is on watch for confirmation in the next earnings report  In fact  these claims form a large part of the investing thesis in PHM in spite of deteriorating housing data 
PHM also expressed confidence in the value of the company by purchasing 2 4M shares for  67M during the third quarter  The average price of  28 14 share of course turned out to be a significant premium with the stock still trading comfortably below that level

The concerns over the health of the housing market are clearly palpable for PHM management as the CEO tried to address these worries at the very start of the conference call  He even referenced the weakness in the stocks of home builders as evidence of the concerns 

 I would typically focus my opening comments on the strength of our Q3 numbers  But when housing stocks drop over 20  during that same period  it may be more useful to start with the review of market conditions as this seems to be an area of focus for our investors  Based on industry dynamics  we maintain our positive view on the housing market and the overall sustainability of the current housing recovery  We fully appreciate  however  that operating conditions have changed over the past several months 
In what we view as a good operating environment  but one that is arguably more challenging than 6 to 9 months ago  we are well positioned to deliver ongoing financial success  

Those were the bookends of the summary  The summary was laced with some very real blemishes  Moreover  the summary leaned heavily on the same macroeconomic trends and strengths that are well known and have yet to reverse the slowdown in the housing market  Here are my key bullet points from the CEO s summary  in between the bookends  
Buyer interest high  Q3 buyer traffic  15  year over year  accelerating through the quarter 
Affordability becoming a bigger issue  absorption pace conversion rate down  feedback from sales teams  Talked about lower conversion rate in last earnings call when mortgage rates started increasing in May 
Market conditions more competitive 
Macro economic data are strong and housing supply remains tight 
Period of adjustment will smooth over current challenges    some combination of adjustments in price and or income or simply even just the passage of time should help consumers to get over these hurdles  
During the Q A  management pointed to year over year gains in website traffic as a leading indicator of strong customer demand  Management also saw encouraging signs for the start of Q4   Demand conditions through the first few weeks of October are consistent with trends that we saw in Q3 as high levels of traffic demonstrate ongoing buyer interest  but with consumers taking longer to make their purchase decision  
The quality of customers also remains high  they are not over stretching to buy a home 

 Our can  cancellation  rate was just under 15   That s actually slightly lower than where we were prior year  ARM usage sits at 5   which is down from where we were in the prior quarter  So we haven t seen a huge increase in ARMs  I think that has to do with the yield curve  There s not enough differential on the long part of the yield curve  Loan to values are still well within kind of the range that we ve been operating in for the last couple of years  And credit scores for us  the loans that we actually financed through our mortgage company remain high  

Having said all this  PHM still had to soften its margin guidance for the fourth quarter  This action sets up a lot of suspense for full year 2019 guidance in the Q4 earnings call  emphasis mine  

 Given the composition of our production pipeline  we expect fourth quarter deliveries to be in the range of 6 500 to 6 800 homes  which would put us within our guidance for full year closings of 22 500 to 23 500 homes  Based on our backlog and current production schedule  we expect our Q4 average sales price to be in the range of  420 000 to  430 000  This is a slight adjustment from our prior guidance of  415 000 to  425 000 
Given that overall market conditions have gotten more competitive  we expect Q4 gross margin will likely come in towards the lower end of our previous guidance range of 23 8  to 24 3   

I am surprised this reduction alone was not enough to clobber PHM s stock  Margin slippage has often undermined home builders  like KBH   During the Q A  management provided additional color on its approach to margins in this new competitive environment 

 We re not going to overreact by giving away all of the margin that we ve worked so hard to earn  but we re going to make the decisions that we need to make to make sure that we re continuing to turn the inventory I think you saw our gross margins in Q3 come in near the lower end of our guide  and that s reflective of the fact that we did put some additional incentives in place to help move order growth 
So one of the reasons we moved our guide down on margin in Q4 was that s when we ll feel the real brunt of that push up in pricing early in the year  

So far  PHM is talking about relatively minor margin pressure  The company is staying optimistic because it thinks it has options before resorting to more significant margin hits  First of all  customers have options for getting their pricing down 

 We do feel like we ve got good offerings in the product portfolio that we have that allows consumers to make changes either in the structural options that they add to the home or maybe don t add to the home  They also have the ability to move up and down within the square footage range that we build within that community  So I think we re pretty well positioned there  

The company has prioritized its own options by putting margin hits at the bottom of the list of actions it might take to respond to market pressures 

 As far as things that we can do  there are clearly incentives that we can offer as it relates to option packages  lot premiums  There s financing incentives that we can offer to help alleviate some of the pressure that we re feeling around overall affordability  And then  of course  the easiest thing potentially to do and sometimes the most painful from a profitability standpoint is just absolute base price adjustments  and we tend to go there last  is kind of the order of magnitude of change that we would typically make 
With traffic in our stores  we believe it s a matter of effectively responding to buyer concerns  real and perceived  to generate stronger sales in future periods  

The brightest spot in PHM earnings  by far  is the robustness of demand for the  active adult buyer  market segment  This segment consists of older adults who do not want need to live in assisted living communities but do want to live among neighbors in their similar age group and activity level  These customers clearly have a lot of money to spend  and their demand for housing is growing  I assume these dynamics are a result of baby boomers selling homes in expensive markets and buying comfortable  retirement pads  with cash to spare to support their active lifestyles 

 All of the conversation has kind of moved to the millennials and to the entry levels  but there is still a lot of boomers out there  they have high homeownership rates  And this is a buyer group that  for us anyway  40  of them pay cash  and so they re much less interest rate sensitive  which works to our advantage 
Signup trends by buyer group in the third quarter were similar to what we experienced in Q2 of this year  as first time orders declined 13  from last year to 1 373 homes  while move up orders were down 1  to 2 456 homes  Demand among active adult buyers remained exceptionally strong in the third quarter as orders increased 22  over 2017 to 1 521 homes 
By buyer group  absorption pace among first time buyers was down 21   which reflects the impact of slower sales pace  as I referenced in our Southeast and Northern California markets  While pace decreased 7  among move up buyers and increased 9  among active adult buyers  

Obviously PHM cannot thrive solely on the robust demand of its active adult buyers  but it is a source of business that gives PHM an advantage over other home builders 
In the end  PHM is putting on the typical brave face as the company stares down deteriorating conditions in the housing  This quote summarizes the attitude 

 We still think that the underlying fundamentals of the market are strong  we re certainly in a little bit of a tougher period of time right now  But I don t know that I would expect that to continue for an extended period of time  

This brave face looks good paired with an out performing stock  My bet on PHM presumes this out performance equates to a lower risk profile  The valuation is not rock bottom  but I missed those levels directly ahead of Q3 earnings  PHM s price book ratio is still at 1 6  rock bottom valuation would be 1 0 and lower  PHM s earnings and sales ratios are essentially rock bottom though  trailing P E is 8 8  forward P E is 6 9  and price sales is 0 7  From here until the most recent low  I will buy the dips with call options  I set my upside price target on PHM around the summer highs from  30 to  31 share  I do not expect PHM  or any other builders  to make more progress than that without notable improvements in the housing data and the stock market in general 
Be careful out there

197236,418752,PHM,Toll Brothers  A Slowdown Continues In November  Guidance Holds Hope,opinion,"It was the soundbite on the U S  housing market heard from near and far 

Despite a healthy economy  we are seeing a moderation in demand  Fourth quarter contracts declined 15  in dollars and 13  in units compared to a difficult comp from 1 year ago  Fourth quarter demand flowed to a per community pace more consistent with fiscal year 2016 s fourth quarter  which was still strong 
In November  we saw the market further soften  which we attribute to the cumulative impact of rising interest rates  rising home prices and the effect on buyer sentiment of well publicized data of a housing slowdown  We saw similar consumer behavior in late 2013 when a rapid rise in interest rates temporarily tempered buyer demand before the market regained momentum 
Toll Brothers Q4 2018 Transcript  December 4  2018 
The second paragraph  the portion seemingly most referenced  from the Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  Q4 earnings call sounded like the housing slowdown is itself he cause of the slowdown  That is  if not for bad sentiment getting reinforced by bad press  the housing market might be a lot better  After all  the fundamentals of the economy remain strong 

Household formations are increasing  The economy is growing  The nation is experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in many decades  and consumer confidence is near an all time high  In the past few years  many of our customers have enjoyed wealth creation through the stock market  home price appreciation and salary increases 
30 year mortgage rates remained quite low compared to historical norms and have come down a little bit in the past few weeks  And the 30 year jumbo rate is currently about 0 375  below the conforming rate  The credit policies of mortgage lenders are much more disciplined than in the last cycle 

The logic makes sense except investors have ignored this same logic almost all year as home builders like TOL have suffered tremendous selling pressures  The immediate reaction to TOL s earnings swiveled all over the place  from a 10  gap down to a 2 4  gain at the intraday high to a 1 6  loss to end the day  Since then  TOL tried and failed two more times to break through the resistance from the post earning intraday high  Sellers have taken over the last two days  closing TOL below its downtrending 50 day moving average  DMA  

Toll Brothers  TOL  is starting to lose its brief post earnings momentum as the 50DMA downtrend starts to reassert itself Source  FreeStockCharts com
The good news from a technical standpoint is that a breakout above recent resistance should be VERY bullish for the stock  Still  the hesitancy is understandable  Despite delivering one more confirmation of the housing slowdown  TOL did not express alarm on the conference call  Indeed  management even insisted that nothing has changed operationally because the slowdown should be short lived 

 it s business as usual here I m not here to predict how long these current market conditions will continue  except to say that it just doesn t feel like a slowdown that will have a long duration because of the fundamentals are strong both with the macro U S  economy and with the housing business we are continuing business as normal 

November represented a first bump in the road for TOL  The prior two months showed a good trend 

 the trend throughout the fourth quarter was that September was better than August and October was better than September  But I wouldn t read too much into that since that trend that I just mentioned has not and did not continue into November 

Turning to the earnings release  here are some key highlights of TOL s strong performance for the year compared to fiscal year 2017 
Net income  40 
Earnings per share  53 
Revenues  23 
Home building deliveries  16 
Gross margin   20 6  versus 21 3  for FY2017
Adjusted Gross Margin   23 7  versus 24 8  for FY2017
Guidance for FY2019 was OK but carried a wide girth to account for a range of potential scenarios 
Home building deliveries between 1 350 and 1 550 units  a  5 1  to  8 9  change from the 1 423 units delivered Q2 of FY2018 and  17  to  35  above the 1 190 units delivered Q1 of FY2017  with an average price of between  850 000 and  880 000 
Adjusted gross margin  23 5 
This guidance clearly holds out hope that the housing slowdown ends in very short order but maintains the reality of a potential continuation of the housing slowdown 
The end result is a company with a record low book value ratio according to TOL  TOL s 1 0 book value ratio nearly prices the company for a recession  The company s P E of 6 6  forward P E of 6 6  and 0 7 price sales ratio are all bargain basement levels 
Here are some other key points I found interesting from the conference call 
Internet traffic at all time highs  like PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM   TOL claimed this traffic is a strong sign of demand 
California s slowdown is particularly pronounced driven by price appreciation  reduced foreign demand  especially from China for Orange County   and higher interest rates  The rate explanation is particularly interesting since builders like TOL long claimed that the historically relatively low level of rates meant that buyers would not mind the increases  especially TOL s more affluent customer base 
TOL spent about  503 2M buying 12 1M of its shares at an average price of  41 56 share  Only 15  of this money was spent in the 4th quarter 
Softening housing demand will relieve pressures on the supply of labor in the industry 
The share of cash buyers increased from 21 8  in 2017 to 25 0  in 2018  50  of  active adult  buyers are cash buyers 
Lower lumber costs will benefit margins starting in late Q2 2019 
Tariffs are creating uncertainty for the business   We have seen the threat of tariffs would be greater than the actual impact of tariffs to date  but we don t know how long that may continue  
TOL was very careful to avoid giving full year guidance  TOL  and other home builders  will enter 2019 with more uncertainty and less confidence than they have had in many years  I know this swoon is creating a great buying opportunity  but I am acting with restraint given the bearish pressures weighing on the overall stock market and despite the seasonally strong period for home builders being well underway

197248,418764,PHM,Within Beaten Down Sector  3 Homebuilder Stocks Poised For Big Comebacks,opinion,"Housing related stocks  especially homebuilders  have taken it on the chin this year  Blame rising mortgage rates and a string of releases showing US home sales falling to multi year lows  All of which has prompted investors to flee the sector 
Since the start of 2018  the SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF  NYSE XHB  has plummeted  down 20 1   compared with a 2 4  gain in the S P 500 Index 

But in recent weeks  some of the individual names within the sector have finally started showing signs of recovery  Indeed  the Homebuilders ETF is up 8 2  since October 25  as mortgage rates have come back down from recent highs 
As well  as the current earnings season has progressed  the outlook for the industry has also turned less dire  Overall  home construction companies have framed the recent slowdown in sales as a momentary pause rather than the beginning of a sustained downturn 
Below we highlight the three most attractive names in the sector  which we believe are most likely to stage a turnaround in the months ahead 
1  PulteGroup Inc 
PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   the third largest home builder in the United States  has been on a tear since the release of its latest quarterly earnings report on October 23 

The company  which mainly sells single family homes  has seen shares climb 16  since reporting better than expected third quarter earnings late last month  as it reined in rising building costs  It also raised its forecast for the fourth quarter average sales price to between  420 000 and  430 000  That s up from its previous forecast of  415 000 to  425 000  easing investor concerns that rising mortgage rates would hurt affordability and pressure the company s chances of raising prices 
Chief Executive Ryan Marshall said on the conference call post PulteGroup s earnings release that though buyer interest remains high  inventories are low  with land and labor constraints helping to reduce the risk of overbuilding  PulteGroup shares looked poised for further capital appreciation  The company s top and bottom lines are expected to grow considerably  courtesy of higher revenues and margin improvement 
2  Meritage Homes Corporation
The seventh largest homebuilder in the US  Meritage Homes  NYSE MTH  sells single family houses for a variety of customers  everyone from first  time buyers  to move up  luxury and active adult customers across the Western  Southern and Southeastern United States 

Shares have jumped 17 7  since it reported third quarter earnings on October 24  despite missing estimates by a wide margin  Expected to report profits of  1 37 per share on  899 6 million in sales  the Arizona based homebuilder instead turned in a  1 33 profit on  884 6 million in its fiscal third quarter 
However  earnings were still 30  higher than in the same period a year earlier and revenue grew 10  year over year  despite lower average sales prices on the homes closed in the quarter  CEO Steven Hilton noted that Meritage closed on  the second highest number of homes we ve delivered in more than a decade  this past quarter 
Meritage looks set to continue its strong performance in upcoming quarters as its big bet  focusing on entry level housing  pays off  During the company s last earnings call Hilton said 

 The combination of higher home prices and interest rates have clearly impacted recent home buying activity  especially at higher price points  which we anticipated two years ago when we undertook our strategy to build more affordable homes to cater to the expanding entry level and move down markets  

3  LGI Homes
Currently the 15th largest homebuilder in the US  LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  is a Texas based  entry level builder of housing developments in the southwestern United States  Most of its projects are in the Texas  Arizona  Florida and Georgia markets  Shares have gained 18  since October 23 

During its Q3 2018 release on November 6  the company reported earnings per share of  1 52  which beat forecasts for  1 48  Revenue came in at  380 4 million  beating expectations of of  378 9 million 
The company also announced it had closed on 468 homes in October  Year to date  the company closed on 5 128 homes  a 13 2  increase for LGI over the 4 532 home closings figure for the first ten months of 2017 
Similar to Meritage Homes  LGI has positioned itself as a dominant player in the affordable  entry level segment of the housing market  The average selling price for LGI houses is expected to be between  220 000 and  230 000 this year  versus the national median of  328 700  placing the company in a prime position to benefit from strong demand for entry level homes ",2018-11-07,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/within-beaten-down-sector-3-homebuilder-stocks-poised-for-big-comebacks-200355993,200355993
197253,418769,PHM,Home Sales Data Show The Bubble Is Bursting,opinion,"There s no question in my mind now that the housing  snowball  has started downhill and it won t take long to develop into an avalanche  In addition to all of the  for sale  and  for rent  signs I m seeing with my own eyes popping up around Denver  I ve been receiving emails from subscribers describing the same thing in their area    Short Seller s Journal  July 22nd issue

The existing and new home sales reports this week were worse than even I expected  Given the statistical manipulation tools used by the National Association of Realtors  existing home sales  and the Census Bureau  new home sales    both entities use the same regression software   one can only wonder about the true rate of home sales decline 
Yesterday  CNBC com featured a report titled  Southern California home sales crash  a warning sign to the nation  I was surprised to see CNBC issue a bearish report on anything  This report is similar to what s occurring in New York City   rising inventory and falling sales  Apartment rents in NYC are also dropping  It s similar in nearly all  bellwether  markets 
The Housing Bubble Blog  thehousingbubble com   which was around during the mid 2000 s housing bubble  posted an article on Friday titled   Discount sales can create a snowball effect   The article featured articles from different cities  Portland  Dallas  Ft Collins  Colorado  and Minnapolis St Paul which described rising inventory and falling prices 
This explains why the homebuilder stocks are in an official  bear market   with some homebuilder stocks down over 30  since late January  I have yet to hear or read about this fact from the mainstream financial media or Wall Street 
Today s new home sales report  along with the serial decline in the housing starts data  disproves the  low inventory  narrative  Affordability  rising rates and a shrinking pool of potential homebuyers who can qualify for a conforming mortgage has torpedoed demand  The latest U of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report featured this chart on homebuying sentiment 

As you can see  the consumer  sentiment  toward buying a home is at its lowest reading since 2008  This is not a fact that would ever show up in the mainstream financial reporting on the housing market 
As for the low inventory narrative  The California Association of Realtors reported that June existing home sales plunged 7 3  from June 2017 and inventory is up 8 1   A subscriber of the Short Seller s Journal showed me an email in which PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM  was offering up to an unprecedented  20 000 bonus to realtors who sold Pulte homes in new developments in northern Florida 
Housing starts for June reported last Wednesday came in at 1 17 million  SAAR   The Wall Street brain trust was looking for 1 32 million  This was a 12 3  plunge from May  May s original report was revised lower  Starts for both single family and multi family homes were down sharply across the entire country  If inventory were  low   housing starts would be soaring  not falling 
I m sure northern Florida is not the only market in which Pulte is offering large selling bonuses and I m sure Pulte is not the only homebuilder offering large broker incentives  I look at the inventory numbers across homebuilders every quarter  A lot of the inventory is  work in process   But finished a new home does not necessarily show up in the MLS system unless the builder lists it  This is why  on the surface  new home inventory might look relatively low but the builders are showing huge inventory levels in their SEC filed financials 
Because of the nature of the asset  and the relative illiquidity of the market relative to actively traded financial assets  change in the direction of the momentum in the housing market is like turning a large ocean freighter around  The manic phase of the housing bubble is over  The momentum has been turning in the opposite direction since late 2017  Flippers who bought homes in the last 3 6 months will soon become desperate to sell  Some will look to rent and  wait for the market move through this valley and head up again  only find that rental prices in many areas are now below the cost of carry  They forget to tell you that part in flipper seminars advertised on local radio stations 
Soon the  discount effect  of falling prices will snowball into an avalanche  If you think this is wrong  take another look at homebuilder stock charts ",2018-07-26,David I. Kranzler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/home-sales-data-show-the-bubble-is-bursting-200333340,200333340
197254,418770,PHM,Lumber Off Peak Prices But Still Strong As U S  Home Buyers Absorb Costs,opinion,"After hitting the roof in May  US lumber hasn t exactly plunged to bargain basement prices just yet  Clich s aside  however  a near 30 percent drop from the commodity s peak is indeed disastrous for anyone who bought at the highs 

The question for those individuals  and for would be buyers of lumber  is whether the slide will continue 
Is it advisable to cut losses and exit  or just stay away for now  Or will the market remain volatile in the near term  In other words  can lumber be considered as a hold or even a cautious buy  And is it also possible that prices have bottomed 
Should this be the case  it would mean  of course  that lumber is now a clearer buy than it was before  At Tuesday s settlement of  467 90 per thousand foot board  mbf   lumber for September delivery on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME  was nearly  200 below the record high of  659 set on May 14 
But on Investing com s daily technicals  it s deemed a  Strong Buy   with sell indications only emerging beyond the 50 day moving average of  504 65  Fibonacci patterns peg Level 3 resistance for September lumber at  498 87  suggesting the contract has an upside of  30 before running into serious headwinds 
Commodity To Watch Rather Than Trade
When all is said and done though  this isn t a market for the typical day trader or hedge fund  It s debatable if even family offices and institutional funds are keen in taking long  passive positions here 
That s because of the low volume and open interest that lumber suffers from   In the wood futures market  these metrics are even lower than in the frozen concentrated orange juice market   says veteran commodities trader Andrew Hecht  He describes lumber as  a commodity to watch rather than trade  
While the CME values the North American physical lumber market at over  10 billion  lumber futures by open interest are worth less than  250 million  Each futures contract represents 110 000 board feet of wood  and the contract quote represents the wholesale price for 1 000 board feet 
Total open interest  a measure of liquidity from the number of open long and short positions  stood at 4 582 contracts as of August 20  The all time high was set a decade ago at 14 403 contracts 
Daily volume in lumber futures has been around 1 300 contracts lately  For perspective  the average daily volume in US crude oil is around one million contracts  while open interest is above two million 
The reason lumber futures are more watchable than tradable is because those invested in them are primarily mills and producers and marketers of lumber and lumber products looking to minimize the risk of price fluctuations in construction grade wood  Consumers  including homebuilders  furniture manufacturers and retailers  make up the other side of the market  as they seek fixed prices for their wood supplies 
Housing Market Harbinger
But lumber is also a harbinger of the US housing market  which  in turn  is a pillar of the world s No  1 economy  That makes it as important a commodity as any to watch  This year  particularly  wood futures have come under investors  radar after the US imposed anti dumping and anti subsidy duties of 20 percent or more on lumber imports from Canada  lighting a flame under CME lumber that led to a 30 percent price hike on the year 
While softer US housing starts in July and August have forced lumber futures to retreat from those highs  investors in housing portfolios remain positive on the outlook for timber in general  given wood s indispensable status as a building material and expectations for higher inflation from at least two more US rate hikes this year   The housing market credits have been doing very well  the ones we invest in specifically   said Matt Kennedy  portfolio manager at the Angel Oak High Yield Opportunities Fund  which owns the debt of several home builders  suppliers  and distributors of home building materials 
Kennedy said home builders in Angel Oak s portfolio experienced strong sales despite this year s pricier lumber 

 The communities they are selling in  there seems to be quite a bit of demand  Average home selling prices continue to grind higher with the higher lumber market  and they ve been able to factor the higher costs into new home prices  

At least two major US home builders have said that materials costs weren t a major hindrance this year meaning lumber prices could still rise   Everyone knows the story behind lumber and its fluctuations  which are currently on the decline   David Messenger  chief financial officer at Century Communities  NYSE CCS   said during the company s second quarter earnings call in early August 

 We focus on mitigating these increases through home price appreciation  national purchasing agreements  process efficiencies and long term supplier and trade relationships  As we start new homes and underwrite new land acquisitions  we factor in cost inflation and higher interest cost into our assumption  

Ryan R  Marshall  president of PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   had a similar message to share at the company s quarterly call with analysts last month   When market dynamics include sustained demand and limited supply  prices will typically increase   Marshall said   This has certainly been the situation in housing for a number of years and has only continued as builders seek to pass through higher labor and material costs  ",2018-08-22,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lumber-off-peak-highs-but-still-strong-as-us-home-buyers-absorb-costs-200339930,200339930
197260,418776,PHM,LGI Homes Delivers Solid Earnings And Gets Back A Vicious Fade,opinion,"Management for LGI Homes  NASDAQ LGIH  set aside an hour for   They only needed 37 minutes  including 23 minutes spent on Q A  Perhaps they should have used the entire hour 

In just two days  LGI Homes  LGIH  is down 22 9  from its post earnings high  With extremely high volume and 200DMA support directly below  a major washout event could be in the works or the prelude to a major breakdown 
As the chart above shows  LGIH has had a wild two days following its earnings report  The first day alone shocked me given the wide range falling from a new intraday all time high  The second day of violent selling made me buy some shares even as investors and traders in home builders went into automatic sell mode as the 10 year U S  Treasury bond  again  LGIH is right back to support at its 200 day moving average  DMA   This trend line has held for a year and a doubling in the stock price 
Critically  given LGIH remains one of the hottest builders in the sector  I think of this stock move as a major test of the durability of builders going forward  If LGIH cannot hold support here  and even worse makes a new low for the year  then I will have to conclude that the market has truly nailed the top in builders as a whole  I have gone back and forth on this issue in the past several   Right now  I am back to hoping that I do not have to wait until the seasonally strong period starts up in November to see builders regain at least some of the momentum they lost after the January peak 
I decided to check out the conference call to look for clues that upset the market so much  LGIH reported its typical exceptional revenue and earnings growth  The company also reaffirmed guidance   from the press release 

  the Company reaffirms the following guidance for 2018  The Company believes it will have between 85 and 90 active selling communities at the end of 2018  close between 6 000 and 7 000 homes in 2018  and generate basic EPS between  6 00 and  7 00 per share during 2018  In addition  the Company believes 2018 gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 24 0  and 26 0  and 2018 adjusted gross margin  non GAAP  as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 25 5  and 27 5  with capitalized interest accounting for substantially all of the difference between gross margin and adjusted gross margin  The Company also believes that the average home sales price in 2018 will be between  220 000 and  230 000  

I listened instead of reading the transcript because I also wanted to hear whether the tone during Q A would provide additional clues to sentiment  The tones were not revealing  but the questions and responses were 
The first analyst to ask questions wasted no time addressing the elephant on the call  This analyst pointed out that the stock was selling off and surmised that investors were disappointed that LGIH failed to lift the range of its guidance  Management acknowledged that it purposely delivers conservative guidance  they want to make sure to hit the numbers  I think this consistency hikes expectations and creates  resistant  analysts and investors who are no longer impressed by hitting the numbers 
That dynamic is important for LGIH because expectations are likely high given its relatively  expensive  valuation with a high price book ratio at 2 8  Builders like KB Home  KBH  are still scraping by at 1 2  PulteGroup  Inc   NYSE PHM  is at 2 1  LGIH s other metrics are toward the high end of builders but reasonable  price per earnings at 13 4 trailing and 8 6 forward  and price sales at 1 1  LGIH also has a large crowd waiting for the stock to implode  shorts have sold short a whopping 38 9  of the float  In other words  the deck is stacked against LGIH when it  only  meets high expectations 
LGIH provided some additional moments of clarity for participants looking for excuses to sell  Management acknowledged the need to spend more on marketing to offset the potential demand suppression of higher rates  They explained this need to spend even as they tried to reassure the crowd that demand has been strong  LGIH also claimed that the impact of rates to date has been neutral to positive  The positive impact comes from the pressure of rising rates pushing people to buy now rather than later in order to save money  LGIH also reassured the crowd that the conservative guidance gives them room to spend more on marketing  Translation  LGIH is not likely to deliver an upside surprise 
LGIH had a dual story on costs  On the one hand  LGIH said that the rising costs of materials and labor have been  less impactful  over the last 3 to 4 months in terms of frequency and amount   I found this surprising given that lumber futures have been hitting records and tripping circuit breakers on the way up   Yet  rising costs going forward will force more price increases even as affordability issues are a headwind  LGIH raised prices in 80 to 90  of its communities in April   As a result  margins will stay consistent rather than  ramp up in the back end  of the year  Translation  LGIH is not likely to deliver an upside surprise 
Home builders continue to be a tough slog  Around every corner there is a negative catalyst to capture imaginations and deliver reasons to sell  For this trade  I am looking at a defined window of opportunity between the low and highs of the year  In the shortest term  even a 5 point rebound to 50DMA resistance would be a satisfying  victory  
Be careful out there

197261,418777,PHM,Is PulteGroup  Inc   PHM  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  PulteGroup  Inc  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts PulteGroup  Inc  s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 13 7  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that PulteGroup  Inc  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 0  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for PulteGroup  Inc  s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PulteGroup  Inc  has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  PulteGroup  Inc  currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes PHM a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for PulteGroup  Inc  is just 0 5  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0 7  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  PHM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though PulteGroup  Inc  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of A  This gives PHM a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen nearly 5 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 6 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below PulteGroup  Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  PulteGroup  Inc  is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LinePulteGroup  Inc  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 11  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2018-05-20,Zacks Investment

the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Winning Stock Picks from the Best Industries for Job GrowthEvery week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy   from retail sales to housing  to international trade to consumer sentiment In fact  on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports And while the financial media does cover them  they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading For example  in the Employment Situation report  it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion  and which ones contracted I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them In fact  I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible  But  after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report  I knew the housing market had turned  And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery   for those who knew where to look But the headline number and the obligatory one or two sentence

197317,418833,PHM,Zacks com Featured Highlights  Chemours  First Data  PulteGroup  Raymond James Financial And United Rentals,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL  July 26  2017   Stocks in this week s article include Chemours Co   NYSE        First Data Corp   NYSE        PulteGroup  NYSE PHM   NYSE        Raymond James Financial  NYSE       and United Rentals  NYSE       

PEG Ratio vs  P E Ratio

	Which valuation metric is better  the PEG ratio or the P E ratio 
	Before we answer that question  let s first start with some basics 

Definitions

	The P E ratio is simply  Price   Earnings

	Essentially  this tells you how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit  year  of earnings  If a stock is trading at a P E ratio of 30  it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings 

	In general  the lower the P E ratio the better  A common threshold for many investors is a P E of 20 or less   For the record  at the time of this writing  the S P 500 Index was trading at a P E  using F1 Estimates  of 15 33  

	A PEG ratio is the  P E Ratio divided by the Growth Rate

	Conventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good  at par or undervalued to its growth rate   while a value of greater than 1  in general  is not as good  overvalued to its growth rate  

	Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P E ratio   The S P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1 93  

Comparison

	Let s take a look at both of these in action 

	For example  a company with a P E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20  would have a PEG ratio of 1 25  25   20  1 25  

	While a company with a P E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50  would have a PEG Ratio of 0 80  40   50  0 80  

	Traditionally  investors would look at the stock with the lower P E ratio and deem it a bargain  undervalued   But looking at it closer  you can see it doesn t have the growth rate to justify its P E 

	The stock with the P E of 40  however  is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower  0 80  and is trading at a discount to its growth rate 

	In other words  the lower the PEG ratio  the better the value  That s because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth 

	So which one is better 

	They both have their usefulness  I do like how the PEG positions the P E ratio in relation to its growth rate to put everything into perspective 

	Quite frankly  I use both  so I m going to say it s a tie  Plus  you couldn t even create the PEG ratio without the P E 

	But  you don t have to choose one or the other  You can use both  And that s how we re using it in this week s screen 

Screen Parameters

	Let s first start with 

	  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2
	 Only stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy or  2 Buy can get thru  

	  Projected One Year Growth Rate greater than S P 500
	 Market outperformers are what we re looking for  The 1 year projected growth rate for the S P is currently 7 94   So only those above that will qualify  

	   P E Ratio  using F1  less than or equal to 20 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median 
	 Not only do we want our P Es to be below their classic valuation threshold  but we want them to be below the median for their industry as well  

	   PEG Ratio less than or equal to 1 AND less than or equal to X Industry Median 
	 P E divided by its  F1  projected growth rate  This one also has to be below its classic valuation marker and have a PEG ratio below the median for its industry  This ensures that they are considered undervalued on an absolute basis as well as undervalued relative to its group of peers  

	  Price greater than or equal to  5

	  Avg  20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000

	This screen will find stocks with market beating growth rates  yet still be considered undervalued on two of the most effective valuation markers  And of course  with the Zacks Rank added to it  each one of these picks will be experiencing upward earnings estimate revisions  which provides a timely catalyst for the stock to move 

Results

	Here are 5 stocks from this week s list  along with their P E ratio  using F1 Estimates  and their PEG ratio  using F1 Projected Growth Rates

197329,418845,PHM,Lumber Issues Loom Over Another Series Of Strong Data ,opinion,"The last Housing Market Review covered data reported in March  2017 for February  2017  At that time  the iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  was at the bottom of what turned out to be a very shallow pullback from a near 10 year high  The subsequent recovery has been grinding and slow  but ITB now trades above where it was at the last rate hike from the Federal Reserve  The bullish breakout for the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   in the past week translated into minimal gains for ITB 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  has spent over a month SLOWLY churning out a recovery from the last dip  This slow motion action COULD form a solid base for a fresh rally 
In general  the housing data once again looked strong  However with the Spring selling season in full gear  I am not surprised to see momentum in ITB slow to a crawl  The market tends to price in most of the positive lift from the Spring selling season months in advance  An upgrade of Toll Brothers on April 11th seemed to breath new life into ITB and extend the momentum of the seasonally strong period  However  ITB trades just fractionally higher than that point  and Toll Brothers Inc  NYSE TOL  trades a bit below that point now  Per my rule  I almost sold TOL once it closed the gap  but a successful test of support at its 50 day moving average  DMA  gave me fresh encouragement yet again 

Toll Brothers  TOL  is in a 7 week long period of consolidation that is now bumping up against critical  uptrending 50DMA support 
   March  2017 Single family housing starts for February were revised upward from 872 000 to 895 000  March starts dropped month over month by 6 2  to 821 000  This change did not break the on going uptrend  On an annual basis  single family housing starts gained 9 3  which was below the year over year increases of 11 1  in January and 13 5  in February 

The solid uptrend in housing starts continued in March although momentum may be slowing a bit 
Across the regions  starts varied widely  The Northeast took the  1 spot with a 19 0  gain  The South jumped a healthy 14 5   The West continued its gains with a 6 2  increase  The Midwest was a notable laggard with a drop of 8 6  
For January  existing home sales returned to gains and hit levels not seen since February  2007  For February  existing home sales dropped sharply from the previous month s post recession high and served up a reminder of the month to month volatility in this series  For March  existing home sales made a sharp rebound and set a new post recession high  the highest in over 10 years   Right on cue  the National Association of Realtors  NAR  sounded a bit more upbeat than it did after reporting on the sharp month over month drop in sales in February 

 The early returns so far this spring buying season look very promising as a rising number of households dipped their toes into the market and were successfully able to close on a home last month Although finding available properties to buy continues to be a strenuous task for many buyers  there was enough of a monthly increase in listings in March for sales to muster a strong gain  Sales will go up as long as inventory does 
Bolstered by strong consumer confidence and underlying demand  home sales are up convincingly from a year ago nationally and in all four major regions despite the fact that buying a home has gotten more expensive over the past year  

The seasonally adjusted annualized sales of 5 71M were up 4 4  month over month from a downwardly revised 5 47M  from 5 48M  in sales for February  Year over year sales increased a healthy 5 9   compare to November s 15 4  year over year pop  December s 0 7  increase  January s 3 8  rise  and February s 5 4  increase   February sales dropped to levels last seen September  2016 while March sales jumped to levels last seen February  2007  A continued trend higher from here would be very significant for confirming the underlying strength of existing home sales 

Month to month volatility is partially distracting from the very strong overall uptrend for existing home sales 
Putting aside the NAR s swings with the monthly volatility in the data  the main headline for existing sales remains that they have consistently trended upward despite all the reported and now well known headwinds  The jump in sales in January demonstrated the strength in the housing market despite scarce inventory and the resulting increase in prices  The monthly decline in February did not erase that strength  especially considering year over year sales were up  The resurgent sales in March confirms the strength  First time buyers are also still hanging in there  In March  first timers were 32  of sales  same as in February  down just one percentage point from December and January  and up two percentage points from a year ago  The average for 2016 was 35  
The absolute level of inventory of existing homes has fallen year over year for 22 straight months  The 1 83M homes for sale represented a 6 6  decrease from the previous March  The recent year over year declines have been remarkable  August  10 1   September  6 8   October  4 3   November  9 3   December  6 3   January  7 1   February  6 4   In December  inventory hit a new absolute low measured from 1999 when the NAR began tracking  Now  inventory has managed to increase month over month for the third month in a row with a 5 8  increase in March   So it is odd to see the NAR correlate higher inventory with higher sales when that relationship failed for February   At 3 5 months of sales  inventory stayed flat with February  In December  inventory was at 3 6 months of sales 
Investors purchased 15  of existing homes in March  down from 17  of existing homes in February  and the same as January and December  2016  A year ago  investors bought 14  of existing homes for sale  Clearly  investor appetite is far from satiated even as the month to month share of sales has demonstrated significant volatility 
The West was the only region to experience a monthly decline in existing home sales  All regions logged year over year sales gains  Northeast 4 1   Midwest 3 1   South 8 5   West 5 2   All regions logged year over year price jumps  Northeast 2 8   Midwest 6 2   South 8 6   West 8 0   The price surges in the South and West make the strong annual sales increases in those regions even more impressive again given the NAR has a habit of blaming high prices for lower sales in the national numbers 
March s 6 8  year over year increase in the overall median price of an existing home represents the 61st consecutive month of year over year increases  The median price of  236 400 is a healthy jump from February s  228 900  Yet  the all time record continues to fade into the distance   247 700 set in June  2016   Thus  it is quite possible that a year over year DECLINE in price may finally occur this year even with inventory at such extreme lows  watch how the housing bears growl over THAT headline   
Single family sales increased on a monthly basis  4 3   and increased on a yearly basis by 6 1   November s 16 2  year over year surge was definitely an anomaly  The median price of  237 800 ended a string of monthly declines and left February s  229 900 in the rear view mirror  The median price was also up 6 6  year over year 

 Single family home sales climbed 4 3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 08 million in March from 4 87 million in February  and are now 6 1 percent above the 4 79 million pace a year ago  The median existing single family home price was  237 800 in March  up 6 6 percent from March 2016  


New home sales were the big headline last August as July sales soared to 622 000 and a fresh post recession high  I predicted that post recession peak would not get challenged until the 2017 Spring selling season  That prediction came through right on time as March s new home sales hit 621 000 for a 5 8  month over month gain and a whopping 15 6  year over year surge 
New single family home sales for February were revised slightly downward to 587 000 from 592 000  Recall that December brought an end to an impressive streak of year over year gains  The streak may have resumed with February  12 8  and now March s  15 6  

The uptrend on new home sales is firmly back on track and headed to a new post recession high 
Source  US  Bureau of the Census  New One Family Houses Sold  United States  HSN1F     April 27  2017 
New home inventory stayed level at 5 2 months of supply  This level continues to sit in  surprisingly  sharp contrast with the much more scarce inventory of existing homes  As a result  I do not think the relatively slow pace of home building can explain much of the strain on the inventory of existing home sales  Recall that a market for homes is in balance at 6 months of supply 
New home sales again exhibited a large range of year over year changes across regions  all positive  The Northeast gained 21 9   The Midwest cooled down from February s 50 8  gain with a 23 3  increase  The West led the pack with a 32 6  surge  The South was a major laggard at 5 9  
The Housing Market Index  HMI  was the most impressive data point of my Housing Market Review to end 2016  I thought the story for early 2017 would be a cooling of this red hot confidence  Instead  in March  builder confidence soared to a new 12 year high  In April  the HMI pulled back a bit by 3 points to 68 
The Housing Market Index  HMI  registered at 71 for March  That was a 6 point surge from February and a 2 point hurdle over 2016 s historically strong close  I stated in December that I did not expect confidence to get much higher than that 69 reading because sentiment was last that high at the top of the last housing bubble  Despite April s small pullback  I now think builder confidence could set another 12 year  high in the coming months  President Trump s 20  tariff on  imported from Canada represents a strong headwind to that prediction  more on this action in the parting thoughts section  
The National Association of Home Builders  NAHB  implied in November that the HMI might drop in the wake of the election  In December  the NAHB gave credit to the election for a surge in the HMI  The NAHB took the two month pullback  January and February  in stride by implying that sentiment had overheated  With sentiment heating up again  the NAHB took a familiar cautionary tone 

 Builders are buoyed by President Trump s actions on regulatory reform  particularly his recent executive order to rescind or revise the waters of the U S  rule that impacts permitting 
While builders are clearly confident  we expect some moderation in the index moving forward Builders continue to face a number of challenges  including rising material prices  higher mortgage rates  and shortages of lots and labor  

So understandably in April the NAHB called March s reading  unusually high   Yet  the NAHB also noted that  even with this month s modest drop  builder confidence is on very firm ground  and builders are reporting strong interest among potential home buyers   Indeed  all three components of the HMI are still in strong uptrends rebounds 


Like consumer confidence  the components of the Housing Market Index  HMI  sit just off decade  highs  Extended uptrends remain in place 

There was a wide disparity in the regional changes in HMI  Surprisingly  the West stayed relatively flat for the fourth month in a row  The sequence of 75  76  77  and 77  from January to April  confirm that the 86 from December was a huge anomaly  The South dropped only one point from 71 to 70  The Midwest dropped 5 points from 72 to 67  The Northeast was the big drag with a plunge from 53 to 45  The Northeast has been particularly volatile with a sequence of 47  57  51  39  53  and 45 from November to April 
Parting thoughts Earnings season did not deliver any dramatic headlines  The biggest mover was a gap down for PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM   Stock broke down below 50DMA support for a 3 8  loss  The stock quickly rallied back to its 50DMA 

Pulte Homes  PHM  is struggling to recover from a post earnings setback
I saw little in the headline numbers to explain the pullback  Perhaps sellers panicked on a slightly lower than expected Q1 gross margin   Our gross margins reflect the ongoing impact of anticipated land  labor  and materials cost increases  Margins in the quarter were also impacted by the mix of homes closed as we deliver fewer active adult homes which typically carry our highest gross margins   from the Seeking Alpha transcript of the earnings call   However  PHM reaffirmed 2017 guidance for gross margin  PHM also delivered a very bullish outlook on housing demand for 2017 

 As we closed out 2016  there was concern in and around the housing industry about the potential impact the rising interest rates would have on buyer demand heading into the 2017 spring selling season  With the first quarter complete  it is clear that higher rates have not dampened buyer interest  In fact  it looks like the housing recovery may be picking up steam  

Material costs have been rising for quite some time for home builders  Lumber prices in particular have moved upward strongly  The rally came to a head when on April 24th the Commerce Department announced a tariff on softwood lumber imported from Canada 

 Today  U S  Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced the preliminary determination in the countervailing duty  CVD  investigation of softwood lumber from Canada 
Commerce preliminarily determined that exporters of softwood lumber from Canada received countervailable subsidies of 3 02 percent to 24 12 percent 
In 2016  imports of softwood lumber from Canada were valued at an estimated  5 66 billion 
As a result of today s determination  Commerce will instruct U S  Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits based on these preliminary rates  Also  since Commerce determined that critical circumstances exist  certain companies will be subject to the retroactive collection of cash deposits  

The dispute between the U S  and Canada over lumber stretches back decades  The current regulatory action followed on the heels of Canadian action against U S  dairy products  President Trump was strident in his commentary when he claimed that  Canada has outsmarted our politicians for many years   The riffs prompted the Commerce Department to issue the following statement on U S  Canada trade relations immediately following the lumber announcement 

 It has been a bad week for U S  Canada trade relations  Last Monday  it became apparent that Canada intends to effectively cut off the last dairy products being exported from the United States  Today  in a different matter  the Department of Commerce determined a need to impose countervailing duties of roughly one billion dollars on Canadian softwood lumber exports to us  This is not our idea of a properly functioning Free Trade Agreement  

Perhaps anticipating trouble  the NAHB released a statement in mid April pleading with the U S  government to step carefully on the lumber issue  Apparently  Canada is now looking to China as a potential export market which might help drive up lumber prices further as the U S  competes with Chinese buyers 

 The fact that Canada is seeking alternative sources to the U S  for its lumber exports should serve as a wake up call to Washington policymakers  More than one third of the lumber used in the U S  last year came from exports because the U S  does not produce enough lumber to meet the nation s needs  Home builders need a consistent  reasonably priced supply of lumber to keep housing affordable for hard working American families 
 it would be in the best interests of the U S  and Canada to achieve a long term solution to the ongoing trade dispute that ensures U S  lumber consumers have access to a stable supply of lumber at competitive prices  

PHM addressed the lumber issue in its earnings report  Management believes that the market anticipated the impact of a lumber tariff with the price rally over the last 10 12 weeks  This explanation could help explain why home builder stocks did not react much to the announcement and also explains how Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross can claim that this tariff will have little impact on prices going forward  Coincidentally  PHM reported earnings the next morning so some market observers mistakenly thought the drop in PHM was a result of the lumber dispute  If they had noted ITB closed near flat on the day  they would have avoid such a casual and careless mistake  Again from the Seeking Alpha transcript of PHM s earnings call 

 I guess on the lumber tariffs  you ve seen lumber prices move over the last 10 or 12 weeks  I think most people would suggest that s really been in anticipation of this  And I don t think that the announcement last night was any more significant  it might even be a little less significant than people were expecting  So volatility drives change and I m not sure what will happen  But at this point it looks like the market has been expecting this so we don t expect anything dramatic from that  Obviously  how it plays out over time can have an influence on our cost structure 

Nightly Business Report and the PBS Newshour produced good segments on the lumber dispute that provide background and estimated costs to the building industry 


Ironically  a few days after the dairy and lumber issues raised fresh alarms about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   the Trump administration materially softened its stance on NAFTA by stating it wants to renegotiate rather than destroy the agreement 
The bottom line  higher lumber prices are already baked into home builders for now  Still  the higher prices for lumber are an unwelcome headwind and exacerbation of the lumber dispute could slow down the housing market at the margins  The tariff prevents U S  home buyers from enjoying the subsidies from Canada s government and in turn transfers money from home buyers to the U S  lumber industry 
Be careful out there

197381,418897,PHM,Advanced Energy  Hain Celestial  Nobilis Health  PulteGroup And Semiconductor Manufacturing International Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   September 15  2016    highlightsAdvanced Energy    as the Bull of the Day and  Hain Celestial    as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Nobilis Health Corp    PulteGroup Inc  NYSE PHM     andSemiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation      

Here is a synopsis of all the five stocks  

  

Today s Bull of the Day is a little bit of a misnomer  Not that it s not a bullish idea  but it s the very name of the company that can throw people off  The company is called Advanced Energy    but surprisingly it s not an oil company  Advanced Energy is a leader in the development and support of technologies critical to high technology  high growth manufacturing processes used in the production of semiconductors  flat panel displays  data storage  solar cells  architectural glass and other advanced product applications  The company creates solutions that maximize process impact  improve productivity and lower the cost of ownership for its customers  This portfolio includes a comprehensive line of technology solutions in power  flow  thermal management and plasma and ion beam sources for OEM manufacturers 

If all that seems a little bit confusing  don t worry about it  What s clear as day is the way analysts feel about their business  Over the last 60 days  three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year and next year  The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  2 26 to  2 51 for the current year  and jumped up next year s numbers from  2 38 to  2 53  The bullish estimate has the company clocking in at a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  



  



Things have been less than heavenly over at Hain Celestial      A rough month has seen shares go from  56 to the mid  30s  What caused all this drama  The reasons why are enough to make this today s Bear of the Day here 

The Hain Celestial Group  Inc  manufactures  markets  distributes  and sells organic and natural products in the United States  the United Kingdom  Canada  and Europe  Its grocery products include infant formula  infant  toddler  and kids foods  diapers and wipes  rice and grain based products  flour and baking mixes  breads  hot and cold cereals  pasta  condiments  cooking and culinary oils  granolas  granola bars  and cereal bars  canned  chilled fresh  aseptic  and instant soups  Greek style yogurt  chilies and packaged grains  and chocolates and nut butters  as well as plant based beverages and frozen desserts  such as soy  rice  almond  and coconut 

There s nothing Wall Street hates more than a delayed earnings report  The company delayed its annual filing because it s investigating certain revenue arrangements with distributors  Some of these concessions may have an impact on their revenues and bottom line  That  added to lowered guidance  was enough to set off a huge selloff in the stock and cause several analysts to drop their earnings estimates 

Seven analysts have dropped their earnings estimates for the current quarter and current year  while six have followed suit for next year  The bearish attitude was enough to drop our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 60 cents to 55 cents and cut next year s number from  2 25 to  2 11  While it wasn t the most dramatic drop in estimates  the overall magnitude and agreement among analysts was enough to drop it down to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

197383,418899,PHM,4 Homebuilder Stocks To Buy On Upbeat Data,opinion,The National Housing Association of Home Builders or NAHB Wells Fargo Housing Market Index or HMI scaled to 65 in September    the highest since Oct 2005  This reading mainly reflects builder perceptions of current single family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months Prospects BrightSo are the builders shaking off global economic worries as well as volatile financial markets concerns  At least the latest reading hints at renewed strength in the sector NAHB Chairman Ed Brady has shown confidence in many markets across the nation as builders are seeing more buyers  given the rise in household income  Brady added   The single family market continues to make gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017  Current sales expectations rose six points to 71 and the gauge charting sales expectations in the next six months grew five points to 71  Again  the index measuring traffic of prospective buyers reported a four point gain to 48  This positive sentiment may be pointing toward the fact that the housing market has been cushioned against some of the dampeners such as a relatively strong dollar and economic discord in nations like China That said  concerns surrounding the availability of land and construction workers continue to raise concerns  Again  low interest rates and growing rents have made a home purchase more logical Interest Rate Hike Around the Corner Now  one factor that could be dampening investors  sentiments is the possibility of an interest rate hike  On Sep 21  the Federal Reserve or Fed will hold a policy meeting where officials take a decision on whether to elevate short term interest rates  It is to be noted in this regard that a rate hike could make mortgages more expensive   However  as per a Reuters poll of economists  the Fed will likely leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two day meeting on Sep 21  The Fed has not raised rates this year even after signaling at four rate hikes in 2016  last December  That number has since been scaled down to two this year  with another three hikes scheduled for 2017  owing to a global slowdown  financial market volatility and tepid U S  inflation Overall  steady economic growth  along with increasing household formation  favorable demographics  low interest rates  and the attractiveness of owning versus rent is fueling demand In late Aug 2016  the Commerce Department reported new home sales increase of 5 4  in July  after the sudden fall in June  The National Association of Realtors also reported a rise in sales of existing homes to their precession levels in July  Meanwhile  all eyes

197394,418910,PHM,EMCOR  EME  Posts Striking Q2 Earnings Beat  Guidance Up,opinion,EMCOR Group Inc    NYSE EME   posted an incredible beat in its second quarter 2016 results  as its adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 95 cents per share  exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents by nearly 34   The figure also fared impressively in year over year comparison  surpassing the year ago tally of 74 cents by 28 4    The robust bottom line performance was driven by an impressive organic growth across the company s segments  coupled with streamlined costs and superior operational execution  The company raised its 2016 guidance for the second time  on the back of impressive backlog levels and an increasing traction in the U S  construction and industrial services markets Net income from continuing operations came in at  56 5 million  up 20 2  compared with  47 million in the prior year period Inside the HeadlinesRevenues for the quarter rose an impressive 16 9  year over year to  1 933 million  and also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 770 million  significantly  Strong revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by broad based  robust organic performance across the company s domestic segments  coupled with solid contribution from its recent acquisitions The U S  Mechanical Construction segment  up 14  year over year  sustained its robust momentum and delivered double digit revenue and operating income growth  The industrial  water  and hospitality market sectors contributed strongly to the impressive growth The company s Industrial Services business also had a great quarter  up 48  year over year   led by increased field service activities and higher demand for services like specialty welding services  Also  the U S  Electrical Construction segment  up 22  year over year  benefited from the Ardent acquisition as well as greater project activity within the hospitality  commercial transportation and hospitality market sectors The U S  Building Services segment also performed well  rising 5 3  year over year driven by significant contribution from acquisitions Geographically  revenues from total U S  operations jumped 18 1  year over year to  1 842 8 million  However  revenue growth from the United Kingdom building services was much less impressive  inching down 1 1  year over year to  90 6 million As of Jun 30  2016  EMCOR s backlog stood at a record level of  3 81 billion  up 5 1  year over year  driven by the continued recovery of the non residential construction market  A rise in the backlog of U S  Mechanical Construction and Building Services segments more than offset the dip in backlog for U S  Electrical Construction and U S  Industrial Services segments  resulting in overall growth  The backlog in the U K  Building Services segment  down  16 7 million year over year  was hurt by the negative impact of foreign currency translation From an end market perspective  the company saw growth in backlog for the industrial  water and wastewater  commercial and hospitality markets  which more than compensated for the decline in healthcare  transportation and institutional sectors EMCOR s non GAAP operating income in the first quarter rose 22 3  year over year to  95 million  Operating margin for the quarter expanded 10 basis points year over year to 4 8  Liquidity   Cash FlowEMCOR s cash and cash equivalents totaled  443 million as of Jun 30  2016  compared with  486 8 million as of Dec 31  2015  Long term debt and capital lease obligations stood at  289 8 million  declining from  297 6 million recorded on Dec 31  2015 Cash flow generated from operating activities for the three months ended Jun 30  2016 came in at  47 8 million  up from usage of  6 1 million in the year ago quarter Acquisition During the quarter  EMCOR completed the acquisition of Ardent Services  L L C  and Rabalais Constructors  LLC  collectively called Ardent  for a purchase price of  205 million in cash  Ardent is an established provider of electrical and instrumentation services to the energy infrastructure market in North America EMCOR integrated Ardent into its U S  Electrical Construction and Facilities Services segment Ardent will fortify EMCOR s market leading position in electrical construction and services  and will also serve to expand its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors  particularly in the gulf coast  western and mid continent regions The company expects the Ardent acquisition to be marginally accretive to EMCOR s 2016 earnings  with the accretion increasing to at least 10 cents per share in 2017 GuidanceEncouraged by its solid top line performance  accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U S  construction and industrial services space  EMCOR s management raised 2016 guidance  with adjusted earnings from continuing operations now expected in a range of  2 90  3 10  up from previous projections of  2 75  3 00 per share  Also  encouraged by the current size and mix of its backlog and overall positive market conditions  EMCOR raised its 2016 top line guidance  For full year 2016  the company now expects revenues to be roughly  7 4 billion  up from prior projections of a range of  7 2 billion  EMCOR GROUP INC Price and EPS Surprise   Our TakeThis was a solid first half of 2016 for EMCOR  as the company set new records for revenues  operating income and net income  Outstanding performance in the industrial segment  building services and UK segments set the tone for strong future growth  as is reflected in the company s raised guidance Also  a healthy balance sheet position and increasing backlog added to the company s strength  indicating bright future prospects  Moreover  increasing traction in the U S  construction and industrial services markets bode well for the company Apart from this  we believe the company s diversified business structure  along with its concerted efforts to explore beyond traditional shop related operations for tapping other profitable areas like food processing and power  will drive long term growth EMCOR currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Better ranked stocks

a decade  Such sales account for roughly 90  of all the purchases in the U S Thanks to solid housing starts and permit numbers  niggling concerns about supply constraints have also subsided  Add to this a steady rise in the U S  housing market growth and we all know why it will be judicious to invest in stocks exposed to such a market Existing Home Sales Climb to 9 Year HighFirst time buyers have made a return as seen by rising sales of previously owned homes last month  According to the National Association of Realtors  sales of existing homes rose 1 1  in June from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5 57 million  its highest level since Feb 2007  This was in sharp contrast to the consensus estimate of sales falling to 5 46 million from May s figure of 5 51 million Shares of first time buyers touched 33  in June  the highest level since July 2012  This is yet another evidence that the housing market is on a solid growth curve in spite of the much talked about supply constraints   Moreover  it runs against analysts  predictions that the pace of home sales would moderate this year  Sales outperformed expectations and the reasons can well be traced to lower mortgage rates and strong jobs report  Read    Low Mortgage Rates  Strong Jobs DataBritish voters opted to leave the European Union  which stoked concerns about volatility in the financial markets worldwide  But  the housing industry wasn t particularly concerned about the global ramifications of a Brexit  Brexit induced volatility had pushed investors to seek safe haven assets such as bonds instead of riskier assets like equities Higher bond prices led to lower yields  This came as good news for home borrowers as mortgage rates also dipped  as they tend to follow the trajectory of the yield on the 10 Year Treasury bond  The average mortgage is paid off within 10 years  even though most are packaged as 30 year products  Hence  the 10 year bond acts as an indicator to measure interest rate change  According to Freddie Mac  the 30 year fixed rate mortgage averaged 3 45  last week ending on Thursday  down 4 04  from year ago levels  Read    Improvement in jobs numbers and wages also boosted the housing market  Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics  the U S  economy created a total of 287 000 jobs in June  significantly higher than the consensus estimate of 177 000  Domestic economy added higher than expected new jobs for the first time in the last four months  Average hourly earnings also gained 0 1  or 2 cents in June from May to  25 61 per hour Housing Starts  Permits ReassuringReturning to supply constraints  an uptick in new home construction is also helping to address the issue  U S  housing starts rose 4 8  to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1 189 million in June from the previous month  according to the Commerce Department  Starts on single family homes climbed 4 4  in June from May  to 778 000  Starts on multifamily buildings that include apartments and condominiums also advanced 1 6  to 392 000 in June from May  Read    A bellwether for upcoming construction  building permits too rose 1 5  to 1 153 million in June  May s permits were downwardly revised  A rise in the indicator of future housing activities bolstered optimism about the state of the housing industry since a permit is filed before construction begins  Even though the National Association of Home Builders reported that home builder sentiment slipped to 59 in July from 60 in June  it is still roughly in line with the earlier readings this year  Notably  June s figure touched the highest level

	Shares of PulteGroup  Inc     rose 4  on Tuesday on rumors that hedge fund  Elliott Management Corp  has bought a stake in the homebuilder amid a public battle between the board and the founder 

The Public Battle

	In April  the company s largest shareholder  William J  Pulte  made public a letter he had sent to the board of directors that recommended the immediate removal of the long time CEO  Richard Dugas  and a change in the company s direction  Pulte expressed his displeasure over the company s announcement that Dugas will retire as Chairman and CEO in May next year and requested the board to accelerate the process  Bill Pulte  his grandson  and another board member  Jim Grosfeld  criticized Dugas  decision to move the company s headquarters to Atlanta as well as change its overall performance or strategy 

	In another letter  Pulte demanded that lead independent director  James J  Postl  should resign immediately from all his positions in the company  In response  James J  Postl  issued an open letter to shareholders stressing the board s strong support for Dugas and the company s value creation strategy which  has produced significantly higher profitability and shareholder returns  

	Not paying heed to Pulte s requests  shareholders overwhelmingly re elected Mr  Dugas as chairman and chief executive  along with all 10 director nominees  at Pulte s annual meeting in May

197456,418972,PHM,Long Setups And Uncertainty,opinion,"What looked like an impossible endeavor on Sunday night when the futures started trading  is near reality now as the S P 500 has managed to recover 30 points off of the lows from the ES futures Sunday night and 16 points since the market opened Monday 
It may be a simple gap fill before the market resumes with a move lower  or another legitimate dip buy that gets investors talking about a new challenge of all time highs 
For now though  there is no  right  direction to be trading    the short term direction is unclear  but testing the market with a one or two positions is just fine  What you want to avoid is being heavily long or heavily short at this juncture because the script could go in either direction 
Below I ve put together my initial watch list for the week  There are plenty of gems in there  particularly with Facebook  NASDAQ FB   which sill looks solid and ready to resume its climb higher  or there is Pulte Homes  NYSE PHM   which is sporting a perfect inverse head and shoulders pattern
