135438,356953,ROST,Top 5 Things to Know In the Market on Thursday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Thursday  May 19 
1  Odds for Fed rate hike in June surge
Odds for a June rate hike by the Federal Reserve surged following the release of hawkish Fed minutes  which indicated that  most  of the central bank s members are ready to raise rates if economic data points to stronger second quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment 
Fed funds futures were signaling a 34  chance of a June rate hike by Thursday morning  compared to 16  before the release of the Fed minutes Wednesday afternoon and up sharply from just 4  a week ago 
Market players will pay close attention to comments from a pair of key Fed officials later Thursday  Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer speaks at 13 15GMT  or 9 15AM ET  at an event at Columbia University  while New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley will hold a press briefing on the economy at 14 30GMT  or 10 30AM ET 
Besides the Fed speakers  traders will be watching closely when weekly jobless claims are released at 12 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET  after last week s surprising jump  The Philadelphia Fed survey is also released at 8 30AM 
2  Dollar climbs to 7 week highs
The growing possibility of a June rate hike lifted the dollar to a seven week high against its major counterparts  The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  hit 95 33  the most since March 29 and was last at 95 15 
The greenback dipped against the yen but held near a three week high of 110 38 hit overnight  while the euro traded near 1 1220  after falling to 1 1206  its lowest since late March 
3  Global stocks sink amid Fed rate hike jitters
U S  stock futures pointed to a lower open on Thursday  as market players scrambled to factor in the possibility of another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve as early as June 
Major U S  companies reporting Thursday include Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   Dick s Sporting Goods Inc  NYSE DKS  and  Advance Auto Parts  Inc  NYSE AAP  before the bell  while Gap Inc  NYSE GPS   Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  and Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  will report after the bell 
Elsewhere  European stock markets fell sharply  with Germany s DAX down almost 1 5   as renewed expectations for a June rate hike by the Federal Reserve weighed and as declining oil prices also affected the energy sector 
Earlier  shares in Asia closed mostly lower  as many investors grow cautious about the stronger chance that U S  interest rates will rise in June 
4  Oil prices pull back from 7 month highs
Oil prices were under heavy selling pressure on Thursday  pulling back from the prior session s seven month highs  as a broadly stronger U S  dollar and an unexpected rise in U S  crude inventories triggered selling 
U S  crude was down  1 00  or 2 08   to  47 19 a barrel by 9 55GMT  or 5 55AM ET  while Brent dropped  1 17  or 2 39   at  47 76

5  Metals sell off
Gold futures sank to a three week low on Thursday  after the minutes of the Federal Reserve s latest policy meeting suggested a rate hike could come in June  The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U S  rates  as a rise would lift the opportunity cost of holding non yielding assets such as bullion 
Gold was down  19 20  or 1 5   to  1 255 25 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York

 Even though we faced our strongest prior year comparisons  sales performed at the high end of guidance  while earnings per share were slightly above our targeted range   Ross Stores CEO Barbara Rentler said in a statement   Operating margin for the period of 15 4  was down from last year  but slightly above plan  mainly due to higher merchandise margins that partially offset the expected impact from the unfavorable timing of packaway related costs  
Rentler also noted that Ross Stores repurchased 3 1 million shares of common stock on the quarter for an aggregate price of  176 million  The buybacks keep the company in line to purchase as much as  700 million in common stock in Fiscal Year 2016  capping a two year   1 4 billion program authorized by its Board of Directors in February  2015 
Moving forward  Ross Stores lifted its annual guidance slightly from a range of 2 59 to 2 71 a share to 2 63 to 2 72  The full year outlook just missed analysts  per share earnings forecasts of 2 73  Over the second quarter  Ross Stores anticipates that same store sales will increase 1 to 2  on the period

Markets were also pressured by comments from Jackson Hole  Wyoming  where Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi delivered remarks on the labor market  Yellen did not give a timeline for Fed interest rate hikes  saying that with slack remaining in the labor market   there is no simple recipe for appropriate policy  
The comments  were more hawkish than what the market was anticipating  because Yellen kept the Fed s ability to hike interest rates sooner than expected on the table  said Karyn Cavanaugh  senior market strategist with Voya Investment Management

135503,357018,ROST,UPDATE 2 US holiday weakest since 1970  more retail cuts seen,news," Recasts  adds analyst comment  stock price 
 By Nicole Maestri
 NEW YORK  Dec 30  Reuters    Not since at least 1970 has
holiday shopping in the United States posted such dismal
numbers  according to data released on Tuesday that was likely
to prompt retailers to curtail their business even more in
2009 
 The International Council of Shopping Centers said sales
fell even in the week that included Christmas Day  It expects
November and December sales to be down 1 5 percent to 2
percent  which would be the first decline since the ICSC began
tracking holiday sales in 1969 
 While there is still some time for retailers to capture
holiday sales   I don t have a lot of hope that it gives you a
surprise lift   said ICSC Chief Economist Michael Niemira   The
discounts are so great and demand is so uncertain and uneven  
 In similarly grim news  U S  consumer confidence fell to a
record low in December  while prices on U S  single family
homes in October sank 18 percent from a year ago  according to
new data 
 Once the holiday ends  weak spending in the first half of
2009 could pressure retailers into additional store closings 
said Kim Picciola  an analyst with Morningstar  The sector has
already tried to cut its spending  with some retailers even
seeking bankruptcy protection 
  The first half of 2009 is going to be another difficult
period for retailers   Picciola said  Morningstar does not
expect retail sales to improve until 2010 
 Investors took the gloomy figures with a grain of salt and
selectively purchased retail stocks  betting a bottom may be
forming for the beaten down sector  The Standard   Poor s
Retail Index rose 1 percent in early afternoon trading 
  Consumer stocks have bottomed out and we believe that this
is one of the better areas for upside opportunity during the
next six months   said Richard Hastings  a consumer strategist
at Global Hunter Securities LLC 
 According to the ICSC Goldman Sachs Weekly Chain Store
Sales index  sales at U S  chain stores fell 1 8 percent in the
week ending Dec  27  compared with the previous year  while
sales fell 1 5 percent compared with the prior week 
 RECESSION HOLIDAY
 The U S  economy has been suffering from a recession since
December 2007  with diminished access to credit and rising job
losses whittling consumer budgets this holiday season 
 To appeal to cash strapped shoppers  retailers started
cutting prices well before the U S  Thanksgiving weekend  which
marks the official start of the year end holiday sales rush 
 But the economic outlook darkened as the holiday season
progressed and sales trailed expectations  Retailers  initial
price cuts of 20 percent to 30 percent quickly turned into
discounts of 60 percent to 70 percent 
 Winter storms in the U S  Northeast and Midwest also kept
shoppers from stores during the last weekend before Christmas 
one of the busiest shopping periods of the holiday season  In
response  retailers introduced more discounts and online offers
in a last ditch effort to win sales and clear merchandise 
 But the markdowns will eat into profits  Stifel Nicolaus
cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast for many retailers 
including American Eagle Outfitters Inc  Abercrombie   Fitch 
Casual Male Retail Group  Gap Inc Nordstrom Inc  Limited Brands
Inc  Ross Stores Inc and Urban Outfitters Inc 
 Casual Male s shares fell 8 percent on Tuesday  while
American Eagle dropped 1 3 percent 
 BETTING ON A BOTTOM
 Hastings said a positive sign for retailers is the easing
of the credit markets  which could make it easier for companies
to borrow money and finance the purchase of inventory 
  We really have become more comfortable     about some of
the heavy borrowing names that we were much more worried six
weeks ago   Hastings said  referring to retailers like Sears
Holdings Corp and Bon Ton Stores Inc 
 But Hastings said he would be cautious on companies like
Liz Claiborne Inc or Jones Apparel Group Inc that sell their
merchandise in department stores  Apparel makers could face a
tug of war with the retailers that slashed prices more than had
been planned  but still expect their suppliers to swallow some
of the cost 
 The ICSC weekly U S  retail chain store sales index
measures nominal same store sales  excluding restaurant and
vehicle demand  and represents about 75 retail chain stores

over the next three years  What s more  the retail organization will slash another 2 000 corporate jobs  Macy s also plans to abandon its dual headquarters in Cincinnati but has assured to keep nearly 400 of its namesake locations running  Nonetheless  the closing of the stores is mostly due to the drastic rise in online shopping Other department store chains like J C  Penny and Sears have also lost customers in recent times to e commerce giants Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   Only the smart ones like Walmart  NYSE WMT  survived by investing profusely in technology to deliver an enriching shopping experience for customers  However  e commerce players can t be solely blamed for the dismal performance by department chains  Unreasonable expansion of shopping malls  rising rent  collapse of leveraged buyouts and cash strapped consumers have played a role in squeezing brick and mortar retailers  revenues and profit margins Fed s policies  by the way  have impacted brick and mortar retailers as well  Since 2008  the Fed helped retailers borrow a lot of money at almost zero interest rates and that resulted in an enormous retail bubble  No doubt  many private retail chains have gone bankrupt since 2012  And with weaker wage growth in the last couple of years  there are far more problems retailers have to face than just structural issues But those eager to invest heavily in brick and mortar retailers  shouldn t lose hope  Take Macy s for instance  The 161 year old retail chain is expected to open smaller stores in open air shopping centers  which are seeing more footfall nowadays  Macy s also expects to save almost  1 5 billion annually by 2022  much of which will be reinvested in upgrading technologies And talking about the bigger picture  American consumers continue to be confident about their well being  Per the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index jumped to 131 6 in January from 128 2 in December  Consumer confidence touched the highest level in five months  indicating the economy s regaining momentum  Americans  assessment about the economy for the next six months is also promising  The expectations index edged up to 102 5 from 100 Lynn Franco  director of economics at the Conference Board  added  optimism about the labor market should continue to support confidence in the short term and  as a result  consumers will continue driving growth and prevent the economy from slowing in early 2020  Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been  historically  good at predicting future consumer spending for the next three to six months  More the confidence household generates  more will they spend and in the process benefit brick and mortars 5 Brick And Mortar Retailers to Snap UpWe have

135533,357048,ROST,DG Vs  ROST  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Retail   Discount Stores sector might want to consider either Dollar General  DG  or Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Both Dollar General and Ross Stores have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
DG currently has a forward P E ratio of 23 39  while ROST has a forward P E of 25 40  We also note that DG has a PEG ratio of 2 29  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  ROST currently has a PEG ratio of 2 42 
Another notable valuation metric for DG is its P B ratio of 5 89  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  ROST has a P B of 12 81

What s Next for Ross Stores 
While Ross Stores has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

135560,357075,ROST,Beating Bezos  Dividends That Grow 155  To 163  With Amazon,opinion,"If you flip on the financial news this Friday  or click over to your favorite stock website  you re going to see headlines about retail stocks  After all  they can t have a Black Friday without weighing in on immediate winners and losers 
In recent years  the retail sector has produced many more losers than winners  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is blamed as the brick and mortar killer  taking down not only unimaginative retailers but also the landlords that rent to them 

The carnage even extends to shopping center rentiers like Macerich  NYSE MAC   It promises a 10 2  yield  but this inflated payout is due to a stock that split  the wrong way  halving in price without the increase in sales  This double digit yield probably won t last long  It is living quarter to quarter as tenants  and the rents they pay this REIT  or real estate investment trust  are being bombarded by free shipping courtesy of Bezos   Co  
These Token Dividend Hikes Don t Fool Mr  Market




On the whole I would lump most retail REITs into Macerich s troublesome bucket  Problem tenants are going to make consistent payouts a problem 
So does this mean that we income seekers should ignore retail entirely  No  There are actually select  savvy firms that are benefitting from Bezos   Co  taking down their competitors 




One of my favorites is a good one for anyone who prefers their stocks to be  recession proof   Below is a chart of its sales  black line  and profits  dotted orange line  since the 1982 recession  The firm has sailed through the last five recessions  in fact  with barely a hitch 
With results like this  you d probably think this recession proof growth stock is priced for perfection today  It isn t  Because it is actually one of the best companies in a challenging industry  it is still a discounted stock today  Yet for reasons we ll discuss  these industry fears are misplaced for the firm  which means its cheap shares are a screaming bargain 
Why would we want to fish in a turbulent pond   Other than the fact that we can do so cheaply  After all  the cheap can always become cheaper   We re combing through this out of favor industry because we can own the top companies that are easily gaining market share at their failing competitors  expense 

As mentioned  retail has been an increasingly tough place to make a buck in recent years  The big bad Internet has huffed  puffed and blown down many brick and mortar business plans  Why go to a store when Amazon com can deliver it to your doorstep in days or hours 

And it s hard to blame investors for wanting to own Amazon  The e commerce giant is in a constant state of gobbling up and digesting traditional retailers  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services  the firm s cloud hosting solution  prints money too  Bezos   Co  use these profits to subsidize their online domination of retail  mowing down all who dare get in their way 

But not all  it turns out  Some brick buildings are still standing  In fact  their businesses are actually getting stronger and stronger thanks to the smackdown that Amazon is laying on their competitors 
Firms like Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  and TJX Companies  NYSE TJX  are able to buy their discounted merchandise at even bigger discounts  Being the last stores standing  they can name their price  Plus the online world still can t compete with the thrill of finding a bargain in person 
The shoppers inside a Ross store and TJX s T J  Maxx aren t merely combing through clothes racks so that they can buy the same item from their phones  They re going to make their eventual purchase in store  to the benefit of these shareholders  In fact  these two stocks have returned 50  to 100  more year to date than the bandwagon riding shareholders of Amazon 
The Last Stores Standing are Thriving




The rise of online shopping is actually helping these Internet resistant retailers  As competitors have dropped off  TJX s profit margins have improved by 41  over the last decade to 7 7    If you re scoring at home  this towers above Amazon s current 4 3  margins  
Thank You  Bezos  for Bankrupting Our Competitors




We like higher profits when they translate to higher payouts for us  And boy  do they ever with this dynamic duo  Over the last five years these two timeless discounters have shrugged off Amazon s domination and delivered 155  to 163  dividend growth to their investors 
Dividend Growth Up to 163 




This dividend growth is why these stocks have beaten up on Bezos   Co  year to date  As long as these firms continue to increase their payouts  there should be more triple digit stock price gains to come 
With the interest rates plunging  the best move you can make is buy dividend growth  Because if there s one thing we can count on  it s this  as long as so called  safe  investments pay less than inflation  fast growing payouts will be in high demand 
Zero in on those stocks with accelerating payouts backed by soaring cash flows  and you ll be well on your way to doubling your nest egg  and your income stream  fast

You know me  I ve got 7 perfect buys for our new plunging rate environment  7  hidden  stocks I ve handpicked to pay you up to 163  in gains and dividends 
That s more than DOUBLING your money in just a few years 
Imagine turning a retirement  pot  of  250 000 into  500 000  or  500 000 into  1 million  And on it goes 
Plus  these 7 dividend wonders are growing payouts at an accelerating pace  That sets you up to earn 10   13   even 15  yields on your initial buy in just a few years just like the lucky folks who bought Ross and TJX  NYSE TJX  a few years back 
And even if the market does take a tumble  these stocks  soaring dividends give you downside protection as more yield seekers spot their surging income streams and buy in  eager to hedge their own downside with dividend cash

	A disappointing result from a retail giant and more concern on signing a trade deal were blamed for today s sluggishness  though it could also be that the market needed a break after its slow but steady record breaking course 
	The NASDAQ is still on that trajectory as it gained 0 24   or nearly 21 points  on Tuesday to 8570 66  That s its third record close in a row

	The big blow for the index came from home improvement giant Home Depot  NYSE HD   which was up approximately 42  this year heading into the session 
	However  the stock slipped 5 4  on Tuesday after disappointing same store sales and a reduced forecast for 2019 
	It should be noted  though  that the company blamed its reduced guidance on benefits from certain investments taking  longer to realize than our initial assumptions  and not on weakness from the consumer 
	Other brick and mortar retailers didn t have an excuse for their performance though  including Kohls and its nearly 20  plunge

135591,357106,ROST,Ross Stores  ROST  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 97 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 6  
Revenues are expected to be  3 77 billion  up 6 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores 
For Ross Stores  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 14  delivering a surprise of  1 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

135650,357165,ROST,Will Ross Stores  ROST  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   This company  which is in the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this discount retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 1 34   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Ross Stores was expected to post earnings of  1 12 per share  but it reported  1 14 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 79   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 12 per share  while it actually produced  1 13 per share  a surprise of 0 89  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Ross Stores  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ross Stores has an Earnings ESP of  4 03  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 21  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-11-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-ross-stores-rost-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200481848,200481848

Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at the financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are all five stocks that made it through the screen

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if ROST is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this discount retailer holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ROST  shares are up 1 78  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry is up 1 94  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 45  compares favorably with the industry s 4 77  performance as well

Investors should also pay attention to ROST s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ROST is currently averaging 2 348 958 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ROST 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ROST s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 50 to  4 51 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period

135789,357304,ROST,3 High Quality Stock Picks Using DuPont Analysis ,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  can be considered one of the most reliable metrics when investors set out to select quality stocks  That said  we would like to note that the basic ROE calculation doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might get misled by picking stocks based on this number  
Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DD  technique seems to be an intriguing idea

Inside the Strength of DuPont
The DuPont analysis allows investors to evaluate the elements that are the driving factors in any change in ROE  It can help investors to separate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  In fact  it also focuses on the company s leverage status  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  If this is the case  the strength of a company can be uncertain if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor relying solely on basic ROE may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins while finding out the better stock

135816,357331,ROST,Ross Stores  ROST  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates,opinion,"Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 12 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 11 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Ross Stores shares have added about 13 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 9  
What s Next for Ross Stores 
While Ross Stores has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Ross Stores was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

135817,357332,ROST,Is Ross Stores  ROST  Stock Outpacing Its Retail Wholesale Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Retail Wholesale space have likely heard of Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Retail Wholesale sector should help us answer this question 
Ross Stores is one of 224 individual stocks in the Retail Wholesale sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  5 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  ROST is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROST s full year earnings has moved 0 65  higher within the past quarter  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Based on the most recent data  ROST has returned 15 58  so far this year  In comparison  Retail Wholesale companies have returned an average of 11 26   This shows that Ross Stores is outperforming its peers so far this year 
To break things down more  ROST belongs to the Retail   Discount Stores industry  a group that includes 10 individual companies and currently sits at  29 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 19 98  so far this year  so ROST is slightly underperforming its industry in this area

135818,357333,ROST,Casey s  CASY  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Caseys General Stores  CASY   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  153 54 in the previous session  Caseys General Stores has gained 18 8  since the start of the year compared to the 15 9  move for the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector and the 17 8  return for the Zacks Retail   Convenience Stores industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on June 10  2019  Casey s reported EPS of  0 68 versus consensus estimate of  0 42 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 15  
For the current fiscal year  Casey s is expected to post earnings of  5 71 per share on  9 74 billion in revenues  This represents a 3 63  change in EPS on a 4 18  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 07 per share on  10 64 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6 33  and 9 19   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Casey s may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Casey s has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 26 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 12 4X versus its peer group s average of 7 5X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 66  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Casey s currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Casey s fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Casey s shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Casey s Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Casey s have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   Lithia Motors  LAD   and Dollar General  DG   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 7  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Casey s  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-06-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/caseys-casy-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200431659,200431659
135833,357348,ROST,Ross Stores  ROST  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise

This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 12 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 80 billion  up 5 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 15  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores 
For Ross Stores  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 59  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of  1 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of  6 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ross-stores-rost-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200422099,200422099

135892,357407,ROST,Why Ross Stores  ROST  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry 
This discount retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 04  
For the most recent quarter  Ross Stores was expected to post earnings of  0 90 per share  but it reported  0 91 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 11   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 01 per share  while it actually produced  1 04 per share  a surprise of 2 97  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Ross Stores  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ross Stores currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 68   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on March 5  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ross-stores-rost-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200383284,200383284

135968,357483,ROST,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Ross Stores  ROST ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   This company  which is in the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this discount retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 84   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Ross Stores was expected to post earnings of  1 01 per share  but it reported  1 04 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 97   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 06 per share  while it actually produced  1 11 per share  a surprise of 4 72  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Ross Stores  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ross Stores currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 32   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 20  2018 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

135994,357509,ROST,Here s Why Ross Stores  ROST  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Ross Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ROST that show why this discount retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ROST  shares are up 3 41  over the past week while the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry is up 2 89  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 46  compares favorably with the industry s 2 45  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Ross Stores have risen 9 29   and are up 56 63  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  2 87  and 8 29   respectively 
Investors should also take note of ROST s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  ROST is averaging 2 632 835 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ROST 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ROST s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 11 to  4 15 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ROST is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Ross Stores on your short list ",2018-11-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-ross-stores-rost-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200356147,200356147

opening bell  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is pegged at a profit of 18 cents on revenues of  683 9 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported has been revised upward by 6 cents over the past two months  The consensus estimate reflects a massive turnaround from a loss of 13 cents incurred in the corresponding quarter of the previous year  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is also higher than  532 million generated in the year ago quarter Notably  in the preceding three month period  the company reported net operating loss per share  excluding special items  of a penny  vis a vis the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of 3 cents  Lower than expected average rig margin in the offshore segment resulted in the weaker than anticipated results Nevertheless  the company has a decent earnings surprise history  It has not missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters Helmerich   Payne  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayHelmerich   Payne s industry leading drilling fleet  including advanced FlexRig  along with term contracts with well capitalized oil majors bode well The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues of Helmerich   Payne s largest segment   U S  Land   is pegged at  570 million  higher than about  439 million recorded in the year ago quarter and  537 million in the last reported quarter  Higher rig utilization in the sector is expected to back its results  The segment s rig utilization is expected at 65   up from 55  in the year ago period and 63  in fiscal third quarter 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of the U S  Land segment is pegged at  60 million  reflecting a turnaround from the year ago quarter s loss of  4 2 million  The segment s expected operating income for the to be reported quarter also compares favorably with  34 34 million recorded in the year ago quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter s revenues from Helmerich   Payne s other two segments   Offshore and International Land drilling   is also pegged at higher levels compared with the prior year quarter  Fourth quarter revenues for International Land and Offshore segments are estimated at  65 million and  37 57 million  respectively  compared with  55 million and  32 51 million generated in the year ago period  In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of both international and offshore operations is pegged higher than the year ago quarter However  declining rig margin in International Land remains a concern and may dent its overall earnings  For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average rig margin at the International Land unit is pegged at  9 080 compared with  12 390 in the prior year quarter While we are optimistic about the company s overall results  tepid margins from International Land drilling segments along with pipeline constraints in the Permian region may limit earnings to some extent Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Helmerich   Payne is likely to beat

135997,357512,ROST,Ross Stores  ROST  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 20  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 90 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  3 56 billion  up 6 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 29  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ross Stores 
For Ross Stores  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Ross Stores will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ross Stores would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 04  delivering a surprise of  2 97  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ross Stores appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ross-stores-rost-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200358758,200358758

136025,357540,ROST,Are Strategies Safeguarding Ross Stores  Long Term Growth ,opinion,"Ross Stores Inc s   NASDAQ ROST   off price business model  commitment toward better price management  merchandise initiatives  cost containment efforts and store expansion plans have been its key growth drivers  Moreover  the company s robust surprise trend  for both top and bottom lines  has boosted investors  confidence in the stock This has led to an upsurge in the stock price  which is trading close to its 52 week high  The stock has rallied 47 2  in the past year  outperforming the  s growth of 35 5  
Factors Supporting Ross Stores  GrowthRoss Stores  proven off price business model  which provides competitive bargains  continues to make its stores an attractive destination for customers  The off price model also offers strong value proposition and micro merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins  Further  as part of its merchandising initiatives  the company constantly upgrades systems and processes to enhance productivity and improve its merchandise assortments for driving the top line We observed that the company s total sales increased 8 5  in first quarter fiscal 2018  with comparable store sales  comps  growth of 3   Historically  sales have increased 7   7 9   7 8  and 16  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017  respectively  while comps increased 3   4   4  and 5  in the respective quarters Moreover  the company has a positive record of earnings and sales surprises in the trailing eight quarters  In first quarter fiscal 2017  both top and bottom lines beat estimates and improved year over year  Earnings gained from ongoing success in delivering broad assortments of compelling bargains to value focused customers  Meanwhile  sales growth was driven by broad based strength across major merchandise categories and robust comps growth Additionally  Ross Stores remains on track with its store expansion program that targets operating 2 500 stores over the longer term  comprising 2 000 Ross and 500 dd s DISCOUNTS stores  Notably  Ross Stores opened 23 Ross and six dd s DISCOUNTS stores in first quarter fiscal 2018  which was in line with the company s target  As of May 5  2018  Ross Stores operated 1 651 outlets  including 1 432 Ross Dress for Less stores and 219 dd s DISCOUNTS stores In second quarter fiscal 2018  Ross Stores plans to open 30 stores  including 22 Ross and eight dd s DISCOUNT outlets  For fiscal 2018  total store openings are estimated to be 100  with 75 Ross and 25 dd s DISCOUNTS locations Why Stock Growth Slowed After Q1 Earnings We note that this Dublin  CA based company has gained just 2 4  since May 24  mainly due to its softer than expected view for second quarter fiscal 2018  Meanwhile  the industry witnessed an increase of 4 3  
Though strong earnings and sales trends are encouraging  the company believes that challenging multi year comparisons and the competitive retail landscape can be a threat to performance  The company s earnings per share projection of 95 99 cents for the fiscal second quarter was significantly below analysts  expectations  Earnings are anticipated to be negatively impacted by the shift in packaway related expenses 
Further  operating margin is likely to disappoint  with a projection of 13 3 13 5   reflecting a decline from 14 9  in the year ago quarter  This decline is mainly attributed to the unfavorable timing of pack away related costs  and the company s already announced wage and benefit investments Furthermore  Ross Stores projects higher freight costs  which is likely to weigh on its operating performance  Notably  higher freight costs have been a headwind for the company for over a year now  The increase mainly stemmed from significant rise in market rates due to a very tight capacity  Driver shortages  impacts of increased regulation and the stronger economy were the reasons behind the tight capacity 
Diesel costs increased nearly 20  in the fiscal first quarter compared with the prior year quarter  Consequently  the company expects headwinds  related to higher freight costs  to persist throughout fiscal 2018  which is also reflected in its guidance Estimate RevisionsDriven by the soft near term view  analysts  projections for the next two quarters have moved south  However  estimate revisions for fiscal 2018 and 2019 remain encouraging  In the last 30 days  the company s Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 00 and 87 cents for the fiscal second and third quarter declined by 2 cents and a penny  respectively  On the other hand  estimates for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 improved by 2 cents each to  4 05 and  4 47  respectively Bottom LineWhile the company s near term outlook surely reflects softness in the upcoming quarter  the above mentioned strategies clearly profess that Ross Stores still has significant growth potential in the long term  Further  a  of A and long term earnings growth rate of 10  reflect the growth potential of the stock  Thus  we would suggest holding on to this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Looking for More Trending Picks  Look at TheseSome better ranked stocks in the retail space are Burlington Stores Inc    NYSE BURL    The Buckle Inc    NYSE BKE   and Fossil Group Inc    NASDAQ FOSL    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Burlington Stores has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 17 8  in the last four quarters  The company has long term earnings growth rate of 18 1  Buckle  which has returned 58 2  in the past year  has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9 7  in the trailing four quarters Fossil Group has long term earnings growth rate of 5   Further  the company s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with the average beat of 54 1  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2018-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-strategies-safeguarding-ross-stores-longterm-growth-200326212,200326212

136074,357589,ROST,Top Stock Reports For Coca Cola  Eli Lilly   Occidental Petroleum,opinion,"Friday  March 9  2018
 
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Coca Cola  KO   Eli Lilly  LLY  and Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
 
You can see 
 
Coca Cola s shares have underperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry in the last one year    5 1  vs   6 6    Coca Cola reported better than expected fourth quarter 2017 results  ending the year on an impressive note  
 
Despite reporting flat soda volumes  the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and re structuring efforts  Organic revenues grew 6  with growth across the board  driven by price mix growth of 4  and concentrate sales growth of 1   Again  lower SG A expenses  down 21    higher gross margin  up 480 basis points or bps  and higher operating margin  up 540 bps  helped it come up with better numbers  
 
However  total sales decreased 20   marking the 11th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues  Although top line needs to show sustained improvement  the Zacks analyst is encouraged by the company s strategic efforts in making its portfolio much like that of a total beverage company with improved marketing and innovation  focus on driving revenues by improved price mix  digital focus  and productivity initiatives toward driving margins 
 
 You can   
 
Eli Lilly s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the last one year  down  6 5  vs   8 9    Lilly s new products like Trulicity  Taltz  Basaglar  Cyramza  Jardiance and Lartruvo have been driving revenues and the trend is expected to continue in 2018 
 
Lilly expects to launch 20 new products between 2014 and 2023  including at least two new indications line extensions on an average every year  The decision to sell or spin off the Animal Health segment  which has underperformed in 2017  is a prudent decision  according to the Zacks analyst  Also  competitive pressure on Lilly s drugs is expected to rise this year  
 
Meanwhile  challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis and the impact of generic competition for Strattera  Effient and Axiron  U S  pricing access pressure will also remain a headwind in 2018 
 You can   
Strong Buy ranked Occidental Petroleum s shares have underperformed the Zacks Domestic Integrated Oil industry over the last six months  gaining  4 2  vs   11 5   However  Occidental Petroleum s fourth quarter earnings per share and total revenues both came in above expectations  
 
As oil prices continue to improve  Occidental Petroleum gains from more oil production in the Permian Resources and concentrating on high margin production region  The ongoing capital investment fundamental strength of the company will help it overcome the adverse impact from natural disasters  
 
The company generates stable cash flow and its Chemical plant will further improve its cash flow  Occidental Petroleum  like other oil and natural gas companies  faces the risks of cost overruns and development interruptions due to delays in drilling and other approvals  property or border disputes and equipment failures

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ROST due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Ross Stores Tops Q4 Earnings  Gives Cautious ViewRoss Stores reported solid fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein both the top and bottom lines beat estimates and improved year over year  However  the company retained a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018 as it continues to anticipate challenges from strong multi year comparisons and a competitive retail landscape Ross Store posted adjusted earnings of 98 cents a share that surpassed its guidance of 88 92 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents  Earnings also improved 27 3  from 77 cents reported in the prior year period Total sales for the quarter rose 16  to  4 067 8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 953 4 million  driven by a 5  increase in comparable store sales  comps   Notably  sales and comps growth were also ahead of the company s expected rise of 11 14  and 2 3   respectively  Top line growth was also driven by broad based strength across major merchandise categories with children s on the top  Further  sales were the strongest in Florida  Comps growth can primarily be attributed to the rise in traffic and increased average basket size Cost of sales increased 15 1  to  2 922 6 million and 50 basis points  bps  as a percentage of sales  The increase was driven by a 40 bp rise in merchandise margin as well as a 45 bp decline in occupancy costs  However  these were partly offset by higher freight expenses and volume costs  Additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses contracted 45 bps due to the leverage on comps gain and impact of the 53rd week Operating margin expanded 95 bps to 14 6   which was better than the company s expectation of 14  and 14 2   This outperformance stemmed from improved merchandise margins  lower expenses on better than expected comps growth and gains from the 53rd week Store UpdateAs of Feb 3  2018  Ross Stores operated 1 627 outlets  including 1 409 Ross Dress for Less stores and 213 dd s DISCOUNTS stores In first quarter fiscal 2018  Ross Stores plans to open 29 new stores  including 23 Ross and 6 dd s DISCOUNT outlets  For fiscal 2018  total store openings are estimated to be 100  with 75 Ross and 25 dd s DISCOUNTS locations  This guidance does not include the company s plans to close or relocate nearly 10 older stores FinancialsRoss Stores ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of  1 290 3 million  long term debt of  312 million and total shareholders  equity of  3 049 3 million During the reported quarter  the company bought back 3 million shares for  226 million  In fiscal 2017  the company completed its share repurchase target by buying back a total of 13 5 million shares for  875 million Moreover  the company increased its share repurchase authorization for 2018 to  1 075 billion  from  875 million targeted earlier  Additionally  the company also approved a 41  increase in quarterly cash dividend to 22 5 cents per share  The increased dividend is payable Mar 30  to shareholders with record as of Mar 19 GuidanceThough Ross Stores remains encouraged by strong earnings and sales in the recent quarter  it believes challenging multi year comparisons and the competitive retail landscape are concerns  Thus  the company retains a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018  Notably  the company s guidance for fiscal 2018 includes impacts from plans related to competitive wage and benefit related investments  which will increase its minimum wage to  11 00 per hour The company projects earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of  3 86  4 03 compared with  3 55 per share reported for fiscal 2017  For the 52 weeks ending Feb 2  2019  the company anticipates comps to increase 1 2  compared with a 4  growth registered in each of last three years In addition  the company expects sales growth of 3 4  in fiscal 2018  which will be impacted by benefits from the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017  Operating margin for the quarter is projected between 13 3  and 13 5  compared with 14 5  recorded in fiscal 2017  The decline is likely to stem from flat merchandise margin and the impact from the aforementioned wage and benefit related investments Net interest expenses are estimated at  600 000  Further  the tax rate is projected at 24 25  due to the tax reform legislation  The company estimates capital expenditure of nearly  475 million in fiscal 2018 For first quarter fiscal 2018  the company expects comps to increase 1 2   Further  the company projects earnings per share in the range of  1 03  1 07  versus 82 cents reported in the prior year quarter Other assumptions include sales growth of 6 7  in the fiscal first quarter  Operating margin is projected in the range of 14 6 14 8  compared with 15 2  in the year ago quarter  Net interest expenses are estimated at about  600 000  while the tax rate is expected to decline to nearly 23 24  Notably  the company s earnings guidance for both first quarter and fiscal 2018 includes a benefit of about 16 cents and 69 cents  respectively  from the recent tax legislation

technological advancements  the mix impact from growing e commerce operations and Walmart s compelling pricing strategy have been weighing on its margins  Evidently  these factors caused the company s gross margin to contract 11 bps and 29 bps in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018  respectively  Apart from this  the company has also been spending more on store labor to enhance customer service  which can hinder profit margins While these factors and intense competition raise concerns  management s increased earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 and favorable comps view for the fourth

136259,357774,ROST,Tapestry s Multi Brand Strategy To Play A Major Role In 2018,opinion,"Tapestry  Inc    NYSE TPR   looks quite disciplined in its approach when it comes to tackling prevailing headwinds in the retail landscape   sluggish store traffic  stiff competition from online retailers and aggressive pricing strategy  The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products  stores and marketing  These are going to play a major role in 2018 
Despite the tough retail scenario  shares of Tapestry have surged 22 3  so far in the year  against the  that declined 3 9   Further  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock s long term earnings per share growth rate of 11 3  portray its inherent strength 
Catalysts
As one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts  Tapestry boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation  a compelling pricing strategy  new merchandise assortments and a cost effective global sourcing model 
We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable store sales and operating margins in the long term  The company s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under penetrated markets 
Tapestry is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets  The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step toward becoming a multi brand company  Management now expects to attain run rate synergies of approximately  100  115 million from Kate Spade buyout in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior view of  50 million  Management expects fiscal 2018 revenue to increase approximately 30  year over year to  5 8  5 9 billion 
Additionally  the company is aggressively expanding e commerce platform  The company also plans to undertake strategic measures involving  upgrading of core technology platforms and enhancement of international supply chain 

Obstacles
Although  Tapestry reported 15th straight quarter of positive earnings surprise when it reported first quarter fiscal 2018 results  bottom line declined 6 7  year over year due to higher SG A expenses  Even an increase in the top line failed to act as a savior  We also noted that total sales fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth successive quarter 
Analysts pointed that drop in comparable store sales at Coach brand was the culprit behind lower than expected sales  Net sales for Coach declined 3  year over year  Comparable store sales fell 2  due to shift in timing of the Chinese Mid Autumn festival into October  inventory challenges and disruptions caused by hurricanes 
Given the pros and cons embedded  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

136291,357806,ROST,3 Discount Retail Stocks To Buy As Industry Evolves ,opinion,"The retail industry has gone through an immense amount of change over the last few years  as many publicly traded brick and mortar stores now fight to stay in business through the online shopping revolution Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   helped start 
In 2017  more than 8 600 stores are expected to close their doors  according to   This number  the number of brick and mortar locations that closed during the 2008 recession 
In these turbulent times for the retail industry  many investors have stayed away  But the potential for a GOP tax code overall  which would cut the corporate tax rate from 35  to 20   could help the industry immensely 
A recent National Retail Federation  titled  Why Passing Tax Reform Is Good For Retail   highlighted why a Republican tax bill could greatly benefit the retail industry  The post noted that both the Senate and House bills benefit retailers for three major reasons   They address retail s high  unequal tax burden  They enable reinvestment  They provide tax relief to consumers  
Still  if the GOP bill isn t passed  one retail sector the discount segment is already experiencing a boom in a more traditional brick and mortar manner  Discount retailers have capitalized on their core customers and started to expand their footprints 
With all of this said  let s take a look at three discount retail stocks that investors might consider right now

In November  Ross reported Q3 net earnings of   274 million  up from  245 million in the year ago period  On top of that  the off priced clothing retailer s third quarter sales climbed 8  
For the current quarter  based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates  Ross  revenues are projected to surge 12 56  to hit  3 95 billion  The company s earnings are expected to climb 19 48  
What s more  within the last 60 days  Ross has received 11 positive full year earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades  The discount retail power has also beat or matched earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters 
2        Dollar Tree  Inc   NASDAQ DLTR

own program  on its website under which customers are allowed to personalize their own charm bracelets With nearly half of the total sales generated internationally  we believe that the company is well diversified from a regional perspective as well  Tiffany is also focusing on enhancing omni channel platform  Previously  it had notified that its long term objective is to attain ROA of at least 10  and ROE of at least 15  The company is focused on opening smaller stores that offer selected collections of lower priced higher margin product  which in turn boosts store productivity  Tiffany

136320,357835,ROST,Can Walmart s Solid Expansion In Online Grocery Boost Stock ,opinion,Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   has been taking numerous initiatives to augment its online presence and fend off competition from the e commerce giant Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Among its various strategies  it is worth noting that Walmart has been proactive in expanding in the fast growing online grocery space  Notably  this business is likely to account for nearly 20  of total grocery sales by 2025 Progressing on these lines  the supermarket giant recently extended its alliance with last mile logistics entity  Deliv  to support same day delivery for groceries in San Jose and much of Silicon Valley   as reported by various sources  Customers at Walmart can buy online and schedule deliveries anytime between 8 am 8 pm on all days  which will be concluded by a Deliv driver Notably  Walmart s splendid e commerce endeavors  including expansion in the online grocery space  have been fueling results for quite some time now  This  in turn has helped this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock surge 44 4  over a year  outperforming the  s growth of 33 9   So  we believe that strategies like the aforementioned one is most likely to drive the stock higher  Walmart s Expansion in Online Grocery Likely to be Fruitful Walmart  which competes with Amazon Fresh  has been testing same day deliveries with Deliv for quite some time now  Evidently  both companies partnered with smart lock door maker  August Homes this September to test in home and direct to fridge delivery  Per this deal that was being tested in Silicon Valley  users of August Home devices like door bells or security cameras could opt for deliveries by Deliv and monitor the whole delivery process on their smart phones Other than this  Deliv also served as one of Walmart s partners when the latter was testing last mile grocery deliveries with Uber and Lyft  These initiatives highlight the solid ties between Walmart and the last mile logistics company  with both focusing on enriching consumers  convenience  Notably  Deliv has a strong presence in the United States  with operations spread over cities like Atlanta  Austin  Boston  Chicago  Miami  Las Vegas  and Washington  DC among others Apart from entering into deals with third party delivery services  Walmart also acquired delivery start up company  Parcel Inc  to extend same day deliveries in New York  Given consumers  rising preference for online shopping  we believe that the extended partnership with Deliv is likely to strengthen Walmart s online grocery category Online grocery sales played a vital role in boosting Walmart s e commerce sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  Incidentally  U S  comps  excluding fuel  rose 2 7  in the quarter  largely driven by 1 5  improvement in comp traffic  Moreover  e commerce sales positively impacted comp sales at Walmart U S  by 80 bps  Walmart s U S  e commerce sales increased 50   owing to Walmart com s performance  Notably  this includes significant contributions from Walmart s online grocery service  which has now expanded to over 1 100 locations and is expected to have 1 000 additions next year Apart from this  management stated that its food categories performed exceptionally well and recorded the highest comps in about six years  Walmart s international sales also delivered growth  mainly fueled by strength in food and staples categories E Commerce Initiatives Remain a Growth DriverAmazon s rising dominance and expansion in the grocery space has made most retailers trepidatious  thus compelling them to take efforts to combat the intense competition  In order to keep pace with the evolving consumer demand and stand strong amid a tough environment  Walmart s has been taking several e commerce initiatives  including buyouts  alliances  and improved delivery and payment systems Evidently  Walmart s buyouts of ShoeBuy  Moosejaw  ModCloth and Jet com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio  The company s Walmart Pay mobile payment system  and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping

136324,357839,ROST,Can TJX Companies  Growth Efforts Help To Offset High Costs ,opinion,The TJX Companies  Inc    NYSE TJX   is one of those retailers that is performing well even amid a tough retail landscape  This can be mainly attributable to the company s robust initiatives to boost sales and its off price business model  Both these factors have helped TJX companies attract solid consumer traffic  which has been aiding its performance for a while now However  the company has been incurring high wage costs for quite some time now and also expects it hurt bottom line growth in fiscal 2018  It looks like these headwinds have dented the company s stock performance  Evidently  shares of this leading off price retailer have lost 4 6  so far this year  as against the  s growth of 6    So  let s analyze both sides of the story and see if the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s growth drivers can combat these hurdles and continue to fuel results Strategic Initiatives to Boost SalesTJX Companies  aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums  TV  radio and social media  have been boosting traffic at stores  Its gift giving initiatives  unique among off price retailers and loyalty card program  which offers consumers a non credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours  also help the company to improve customer engagement  Further  the company remains focused on innovation and has been introducing new products to drive sales  Incidentally  the company s newly launched U S  home concept  HomeSense  will offer consumers a

main target consumers  TJX plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick and mortar stores  However  TJX Companies also remains committed to its solid store opening strategy  During the third quarter  the company opened 139 stores  taking its total count to 4 052 stores as of Oct 28  2017  Notably  TJX plans to take the store count to 5 600 over the long term  with plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018 While many retailers are struggling with soft traffic  TJX Companies  off price model and aforementioned sales driving efforts help it draw considerable traffic  Another retailer which is benefiting from an off price model is Ross Stores   NASDAQ ROST    which boasts a solid top line growth trend Q3 Retails Solid TrendComing back to TJX Companies  the company has been witnessing year over year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now  Notably  this trend was retained in third quarter fiscal 2018 despite the adverse impact from hurricanes  The top line growth can be largely attributable to solid customer traffic  which is backed by the company s impressive merchandise mix  along with the other sales driving efforts  Further  strong merchandise margins reflect the company s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off price business model  Further  management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note  with its solid inventory position and other sales driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season TJX Companies  Inc   The  Price and Consensus    What s Weighing on TJX Companies TJX Companies has been reeling under high wage costs for a while now  In third quarter fiscal 2018 higher wages dented the company s bottom line growth by 1   with its pre tax margin going down by 10 basis points  Also  selling  general and administrative costs  as a percentage of sales  inched up 0 5 pp to 18 1  due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes  Unfortunately  wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2  in fiscal 2018 The company also posted flat comparable store sales in the quarter  with results being affected by hurricanes  with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States  Nonetheless  trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized  keeping it well placed for the fourth quarter Thus  we believe that TJX Companies strategic initiatives are most likely to offset the barriers and continue

136332,357847,ROST,Count On DuPont To Pick 5 Top Ranked Healthy Stocks,opinion,"Return on equity  ROE  is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity  Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock 
However  delving a little deeper into the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns  Here is where the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis excels It is an analytical method  which examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Importance of Using DuPont
Although one cannot brush off the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always portray a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies with higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
And one of the ROE components   equity multiplier  explained below    can help you judge how burdened a company is with debts  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at a company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen

the Dow were boosted primarily by the Tax Bill being passed in the House  a surge in the shares of Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   and Wal Mart   NYSE WMT   helped the blue chip index post a brilliant show

Inc  reported first quarter fiscal 2018 non GAAP earnings of 61 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  However  the figure remained unchanged on a year over year basis  Acquisitions have negatively impacted earnings by a penny in the quarter  Revenues declined 1 7  year over year to  12 14 billion and were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate    Whereas the shares of Wal Mart gained almost 11  after posting third quarter 2017 earnings which surpassed the expectations  The Arkansas based retailer posted  123 18 billion in quarterly revenues and adjusted EPS of  1 00 per share  which both beat Wall Street expectations  Wal Mart also raised its full year earnings guidance to help its stock price hit a new intraday trading high of  98 01 per share    Such gains also boosted the S P 500 which surged 21 02 points  Of the 11 major sectors of the S P 500  nine ended in the green  with tech shares leading the advancers  The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLK  surged 1 4   Such gains were made possible by a surge in the shares of Cisco after posting an earnings beat  Moreover  this rally in tech shares also bolstered the Nasdaq

136375,357890,ROST,Herbalife  HLF  Stock Down On Q3 Earnings Plunge   View Cut ,opinion,Herbalife Ltd    NYSE HLF   delivered third quarter 2017 results  wherein both top and bottom lines declined year over year  Further  earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  after beating the same for 11 consecutive quarters  Management curtailed its outlook for 2017  which weighed upon investors  sentiment  Evidently  shares of this nutritional products company dropped about 6  in yesterday s after market trading session However  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has surged 46 3  so far this year  largely attributable to its impressive earnings surprise history  Further  Herbalife s stock price performance fared better than the   which declined 16 5  in the same period  Thus  let s delve deeper and see if yesterday s outcome can turn the tables for the stock  or will Herbalife s growth initiatives keep it going Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of 82 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  though it slumped 32 2  year over year  Also  the quarterly figure was close to the lower end of the company s recently updated guidance of 80 90 cents for the third quarter  On a GAAP basis  earnings came in at 66 cents per share  down from  1 01 reported in the year ago period Herbalife LTD  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Increased interest expense  lower volumes and shift of certain promotional event related expenses from the second quarter to the second half of the year weighed upon the bottom line  Further  currency had a negative impact on the bottom line and margins  Evidently  gross margin contracted 120 bps to 80 2  on account of the aforementioned expense shift and unfavorable currency translations Owing to soft volumes  net sales of  1 085 4 million slipped 3 3  year over year and came slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 086 million  The sales shortfall was within management s updated guidance range of 1 9 3 4

America suffering the maximum plunge of 16 1   Volumes at Mexico tumbled 9   while South   Central America and China witnessed volume declines of 6 8  and 3 5   respectively While the company anticipated that results in the United States and China would be drab  Mexico s volume was lower than expected yet again  This mainly stemmed from the fact that Mexico generates significant business from the areas that were affected by earthquakes  Management stated that this natural disaster hurt Mexican volumes by 200 bps in the quarter and the impact also lingered into early fourth quarter As for the United States  volume decline improved on a sequential basis  thanks to the implementation of its strategic plan earlier this year  including programs to boost activity  Management expects these efforts to lead to volume growth in North America in the second quarter of 2018  once the changes are annualized  In China  volumes continued being troubled by government s limits on firms to conduct meetings  thus restricting distributor activities  Other Financial UpdatesHerbalife ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  1 636 3 million  long term debt of  2 176 6 million and

technologies  shifting its distributors  focus toward learning latest tools and business methods  undertaking innovations and launching new products  The company is progressing well with this strategic plan  and expects to witness improved trends this year  and attain growth in 2018 2017For full year 2017  management trimmed its sales and earnings outlook  Herbalife now expects sales to

We note that this leading off price retailer s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters  with a trailing four quarter average beat of 3 2  
Let s now look into some factors that are likely to impact third quarter results 
What to Expect 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has been stable in the past 30 days at  1 00  Further  estimated earnings depict a year on year growth of 9 9   Moreover  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  8 885 million for the said quarter  reflecting an improvement of 7 2  from the prior year period 
Factors Influencing the Quarter
Higher store traffic has been benefiting TJX Companies  comps for the last 33 quarters   In order to maintain sales momentum in stores  the company has been adhering to aggressive store openings and brand enhancing initiatives  Evidently  TJX Companies plans to open approximately 260 stores during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018  Further  the company s HomeSense store concept  launched during the second quarter  is expected to aid comps this season 
In order to support store traffic growth  TJX Companies has been undertaking strategic marketing and advertising campaigns  Its gift giving initiatives and loyalty card program have aided improved customer engagement  TJX Companies has also been ramping up e commerce business and plans to add more categories to the online shopping site 
The company is aiming to invest categorically to differentiate e commerce business from its brick and mortar stores  Such efforts are likely to augment TJX Companies  business and thereby benefit top line performance in the to be reported quarter 
TJX Companies  Inc   The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   However  the company has been struggling with rising costs and expects pre tax margins to be under pressure during the third quarter  thanks to an increase in employee payroll  Further  the company expects incremental investments  additional supply chain costs and pension costs to dent performance  So let s see if TJX Companies  growth endeavors can counter these hurdles in the third quarter 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil  
Our proven model does not conclusively show that TJX Companies is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen 
Although TJX Companies carries a Zacks Rank  2 its Earnings ESP of  1 20  makes surprise prediction difficult

136382,357897,ROST,Will E Commerce Decide Walmart s  WMT  Fate In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,Supermarket giant Wal Mart Stores  Inc    NYSE WMT   has been making aggressive efforts to expand in the e commerce space  which is dominated by Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    Efforts to enhance physical and digital operations has been fueling Walmart s top line and U S  comparable store sales  comps  for quite some time now  helping it surge about 30  over a year  faring better than the  s 19 6  jump Also  the company s bottom line has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight straight quarters now  So  let s see how things are placed for the company  which is slated to release third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16 Wal Mart Stores  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Factors Setting the Stage for Q3While Walmart s constant efforts to expand in the e commerce space is likely to fuel its top line  investments associated with these expansions may weigh upon its margins  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained stable over the past 30 days at 97 cents  The estimate is pegged a penny lower than the year ago period earnings figure  Nonetheless  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  121 1 billion  up over 2  from revenues reported in the year ago quarter Robust E Commerce Initiatives   A Major Growth DriverAs Amazon s growing dominance has created intense competition for retailers  Walmart has been undertaking significant efforts to boost its e commerce sales  This was evident in the company s last reported quarter  wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Results were largely driven by strength in the company s e commerce business  as evident from a 67  surge in its U S  e commerce GMV  with sales up 60   including acquisitions    Well  Walmart is likely to continue gaining from its efforts to expand its e commerce presence across all three divisions  In this regard  the buyouts of Moosejaw  Shoebuy and Bonobos have solidified its product assortment  and are likely to continue fueling sales  Also  the company is set to benefit from its rollout of online grocery  which delivered robust results in the second quarter Sam s Club   International Businesses Bode WellWalmart s Sam s Club division has also been performing well  as witnessed in the last quarter  Incidentally  Sam s Club comps  excluding the impact of fuel sales  rose 1 2  compared with 0 6  growth in the prior year quarter  This was mainly attributable to a 2 1  rise in traffic and 0 8  contribution from e commerce sales  As for the International segment  results were somewhat impacted by the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia  Nonetheless  Walmart s initiatives to serve customers better  in store and e commerce  helped its International sales climb 2 5  on a currency neutral basis  Notably  nine out of 11 regions posted positive comps  with Walmex continuing to outperform as comps here advanced 7  We believe that all aforementioned factors  along with strong back to school season offerings are likely to drive Walmart in the quarter to be reported  In the third quarter  management expects U S  comp sales growth in the range of 1 5 2 0   Sam s Club comp sales  without the impact of fuel sales  are expected to increase 1 1 5  Heavy Investments May Pressurize MarginsWhile the aforementioned factors bode well for the company  costs associated with investments in e commerce expansion and technological advancements  the mix impact from growing e commerce operations and Walmart s compelling pricing strategy remains a threat to margins  This  in turn may dent Walmart s bottom line in the quarter to be reported  Adjusted earnings for the third quarter is envisioned in a range of 90 98 cents per share Segment Estimates for Q3The consensus mark for Walmart U S  net sales is currently pegged at  76 7 billion  representing a 2 8  upside from

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    The Home Depot Inc    NYSE HD    Ross Stores Inc    NASDAQ ROST    Dollar General Corporation   NYSE DG   and Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  These Retailers Will Steal the Show with Q3 Earnings BeatsThe earnings results are usually the corner stone of gauging a company s performance  The third quarter 2017 earnings reporting cycle is drawing closer to an end where we already have a reasonably good picture of the winners and losers in this quarter  This gives investors a hands on data to re evaluate their portfolios and take on board stocks that promise handsome returns Among all the sectors  our focus here will be upon the  sector  A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to struggle in an Amazon dominated market  With market share growing for Amazon Prime  Marketplace and Prime Air  as well as the launch of drone delivery  Amazon is poised for exceptional growth  which undoubtedly presents fierce competition for traditional retailers The rise of e tailers has left the retail sector struggling with lower footfall at stores as all the brands are looking to directly sell to consumers through the expansion of digital stores  Further  these retailers are heavily investing in e commerce and omni channel functionalities  which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term As the holiday season  which accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits for retailers  is just around the corner  analysts remain optimistic about the sector s performance on grounds of gradual wage growth  lower inflation  low unemployment rate  an uptick in the U S  consumer sentiment and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes  Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop  alongside early hour store openings  huge discounts  promotional strategies  price matching and free shipping on online purchases  the holiday season this November and December is likely to be a huge success The nation s largest retail trade group  National Retail Federation   NRF   rightly projects   excluding autos  gas and restaurant sales  to improve 3 6 4  to  678 75  682 billion  up from  655 8 billion  or 3 6  growth  last year and better than the five year average sales growth of 3 5   Additionally  the NRF projects online holiday sales to rise 7 10  to nearly  117 billion in November and December compared with a 9  improvement to  105 billion in 2015 The NRF predicts sales for the period to benefit from a longer holiday season as Christmas is falling on Monday this year and 32 days after Thanksgiving  This will give retailers one extra day of sales from usual  as well as benefit last minute shoppers in the weekend before Christmas While the holiday season is likely to impact the fourth quarter of 2017  we bring our focus back to the third quarter  which is in its climax Q3 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S P 500 Index so far  about 436 S P 500 members that together represent 87 2  of the Index s total market capitalization have released third quarter earnings results  Total earnings for these companies were up 6 8   on 6 2  revenue growth  Further  about 73 4  delivered positive earnings surprises and about 67  beat revenue estimates Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods  Further  the quarter has witness an above average proportion of positive surprises  reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter  Additionally  the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable  with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods Among the 16 Zacks sectors  results for the Finance sector have been below average this quarter  However  this earnings season has been favorable for the Energy  Industrial Products  Technology  Construction  Business Services  and Medical sectors Coming to expectations  total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6 2  year over year  with a 5 7  jump in revenues  Here  the strength in the Technology and Energy sectors are likely to balance the soft Finance sector results For the retail sector  in particular  earnings in the third quarter are expected to inch up 0 6   with 6 2  revenue growth  Notably  the retail sector still has a sizable chunk of earnings to be reported  Only 47 4  of the S P 500 members have reported results so far  Of these  83 3  beat earnings estimates  while 66 7  topped revenue estimates  The sector has seen earnings for the quarter rise 2 9  thus far  with revenue growth of 10 9  The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest  report published on Nov 8 That said  we bring to you seven retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is

A look at the current portfolio shows a surprising amount of retail names of all types  The three stocks below are all retailers of one type or another that recently passed the tough criteria of this screen  Make sure to click the link above to see all the current stocks on the list  RH

The company reported fiscal second quarter earnings per share of 65 cents  which was up 47 7  from last year  The result soared past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents by 38 3   contributing to a four quarter average beat of 21 7   It was the fifth straight quarter with a positive surprise 
RH is part of the retail   home furnishing space  Therefore  it is in the top 18  of the Zacks Industry Rank  putting it in the 47th spot out of 256  It s not too much of a stretch to say that RH is probably one of the big reasons why the space is so high on the list  It reported revenues of  615 3 million in its latest quarter  improving 13 2  from last year and beating our consensus of  612 7 million  Comparable brand revenue was up 7  
Those numbers are all great  but it doesn t account for the 50   gain in the stock since the beginning of September  Instead  the analysts were most impressed with RH s outlook for the full fiscal year  It now expected earnings per share of  2 43 to  2 67  compared to the earlier guidance of between  1 67 and  1 94  It also sees revenues at  2 4 billion to  2 5 billion 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this  ending January 2018  is now at  2 46 per share  which is up 24 2  in the past 30 days  It is also advanced 14 4  in just the past 7 days thanks to that strong quarterly report  For next fiscal year  ending January 2019   earnings should jump as much as 43  to  3 52 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved 23  over the past month and 13 9  in the past week

The company also stated that comparable store sales rose 4   Ross Stores expects to earn between  0 64 and  0 67 per share during the third quarter

Ross owes its success partially to its strategy of being an off price retailer  The company offers designer and brand name products at deeply discounted rates  This has attracted consumers to its 1 340 U S  stores  allowing Ross to succeed despite e commerce retailer threats  like from Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN   
TJX Companies Inc   NYSE TJX    which owns T J  Maxx  Marshalls  and the popular HomeGoods  also reported second quarter earnings this week that beat our estimates  The success of both these off price companies demonstrates that department stores like Macy s   NYSE M   and Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   aren t doing well just because of online competition  but because consumers want quality products at low prices

NYSE   NYSE BBY      5 Stock Picks from Analyzing ROE the DuPont  NYSE DD  WayReturn on equity  ROE  is one of the most coveted metrics among investors in search of profit generating stocks  Delving into the basic ROE  with the help of DuPont analysis  before shortlisting stocks could lead to even better returns  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierInside DuPont s EffectivenessAlthough one can t stress the importance of ROE enough  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  But the DuPont analysis allows investors to assess which of the elements is dominant in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having high margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden So  an investor looking at two stocks only from an ROE perspective will be impartial if the values are the same  However  DuPont analysis will help to differentiate between the two stocks and find the better one  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three ratios   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring DuPont analysis is not very difficult  as the required numbers are available in the company income statement and balance sheet of a company However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

ROST Technical Analysis

ROST opened trading yesterday at  53 92 which was down from the previous day s trading close of  54 37  ROST closed trading yesterday at  53 33 and spiked up after market to  59 55  equivalent to a 12  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time ROST traded above these levels we have to go back to June 19th when it traded at lows of  60 65

For trading purposes  I would like to see ROST open trading on Friday above  57 50 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My  would be  0 40 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity However  delving into the basic ROE and analyzing it at a deeper level  with the help of DuPont analysis  could lead to better returns  The DuPont technique takes investors to a bunch of more wining stocks Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierImportance of Du PontThe importance of ROE can t be ignored  but still it doesn t give investors the entire picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials  However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2

136576,358091,ROST,As Retail Sales Are Expected To Rise  Online Retailers Could Be The Big,opinion,"Consumer spending is expected to rise this holiday season  but the benefits won t be evenly spread  Mainstream retailers  under pressure from Amazon and off price stores  are shifting risk to brands 
U S  retailers are fast approaching the most important part of their year   starting with Black Friday and Cyber Monday and then rolling on to the rest of the holiday season  It s always a critical period  but the stakes are arguably even higher this year after a disappointing performance in 2015  If projections pan out  this year could be a much better one 
Retailers Are Taking Less Risk This Year
Last year  retailers underperformed because of the unseasonably warm weather in November and December   it was 72 degrees on Christmas Eve in New York City  a full 32 degrees higher than the historical average  The warm weather across much of the country led to underwhelming foot traffic at malls and particularly weak demand for cold weather clothing  This resulted in retailers being left with excess inventory   well into 2016   that they were forced to discount in order to clear 
This year retailers have reacted by being far more conservative with their inventories   a key part of their efforts to shift more business risk onto brands  With lower inventories  retailers won t be left as exposed if sales disappoint once again this holiday season  This strategy puts more pressure on brands to provide extra inventory if and when sales are strong   brands  in effect  are being forced to carry more of the risk  and cost  of matching consumer demand or are faced with leaving potential revenue on the table 
Retailers Should Be In Better Shape
Despite the conservative approach  this year could turn out to be better for retailers  The National Retail Federation forecasts that consumer spending will rise by 3 6  this holiday season  well above the 10 year average of 2 5  and slightly ahead of the seven year average of 3 4   since the economic recovery began in 2009  Consumer confidence surveys are also heading in the right direction  with higher levels in 2015 and 2016 than in the previous four years

Online Sellers Are Poised To Dominate
Growing consumer appetites are welcome news for apparel retailers in the short term  but pressure from online competition continues unabated  Amazon is taking an increasingly larger share of consumer spending  notably in the apparel sector  where it is predicted to become the market leader next year  surpassing Walmart and Macy s  As part of Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  push into fashion  the online retail giant has revamped merchandise display on its website and has launched a fashion advertising campaign in the U S  and Europe 

 Amazon is taking an increasingly larger share of consumer spending  notably in the apparel sector  where it is predicted to become the market leader next year     Daniel Kurland  retail analyst

Brick and mortar retailers continue to feel pressure from the change in Americans  buying habits and the move online  Macy s  NYSE M   for example  has announced plans to shut 100 stores  or about 15  of its storefronts  by early 2017 as store level profitability has suffered and the justification to keep these stores open has become more difficult  Traditional retailers are being forced to continue to invest in their own ecommerce initiatives or face the hard fact that they could lose an online sale to a competitor  The purchase of Jet com by Wal Mart StoresNYSE WMT  for  3 billion in August highlights the high cost a traditional retailer is willing to pay to position themselves to effectively compete in the evolving and challenging environment 
There are some bright spots in the brick and mortar world  though  Off price retailers like TJX Companies  NYSE TJX   Burlington Stores  NYSE BURL  and Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST  are doing well despite generally not having a big online presence  Consumers like their value proposition as well as the treasure hunt aspect to shopping in a place where you can t be sure what you might find 
There has been an expectation that brands themselves would more easily navigate the shift in consumer shopping habits  The reasoning was that strong demand for a brand such as Nike  NYSE NKE  could drive a consumer to make a Nike purchase  whether in store  online or directly from the brand  But it is increasingly apparent that brands face their own set of challenges  such as navigating the changing environment of store closures  retailer bankruptcies  such as Sports Authority  and inventory conservatism by traditional retailers 
Here too  Amazon is disrupting the traditional relationship brands have had with department stores  Stores traditionally negotiate upfront prices for goods with brands and  if a particular item doesn t sell as well as hoped  go back to the brand to ask for a markdown allowance to help offset the loss in profitability of having to sell the goods at a lower price  Amazon is different in that it pushes hard on pricing upfront but does not go back to its partners for any markdowns  even if sales disappoint 
Online pricing is a critical area for brands  Many retailers have policies of matching competitors  pricing  and in an online retail environment  price discovery is a much easier process for consumers  With the amount of price matching that goes on in the industry  it means that if lower prices appear on Amazon   often the first place consumers search   low prices quickly reverberate across the industry  The situation is complicated by the fact that there are often multiple sellers of items on Amazon   from Amazon itself to the brands or other independent vendors  To try and control the retail and pricing landscape a little  many brands are choosing to work more closely with Amazon  providing the e commerce giant with their products and even putting employees into Amazon offices to ensure the relationship runs smoothly 
Bottom Line
Whatever happens this holiday season  the main trends in the retail industry are likely to continue  The  Amazonification  of retail is here to stay  The trick for brands and retailers alike is to ensure that they are able to adapt and move in line with consumers  changing habits

136601,358116,ROST,Fred s Dismal Comps Trend Continues  September Sales Fall,opinion,"Fred s Inc    NASDAQ FRED   made a soft start to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 with comps demonstrating a year over year decrease in the first two months of the quarter  After posting a year over year decline in Aug 2016  the trend was repeated in the five week fiscal month of September  which ended on Oct 1  2016  Fred s also reported a decline in sales figures for the above mentioned period 
During the month of September  Fred s comps declined 4 9  compared to an increase of 4 2  recorded a year ago  Total sales slipped 5 5  to  199 9 million for the month under review 
Sales in Sep 2016 were below management s expectations  as was announced during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 earnings conference held on Aug 30 
Sales were lower primarily due to unfavorable year over year comparisons  The front store categories were also negatively affected due to calendar shifts for federal assistance payments  Competitive pressure in pricing strategies  particularly in consumables categories also negatively impacted sales FREDS INC Price
    Moreover  the pharmacy department continued to perform dismally and reported lower than expected comps during the month mainly due to industry wide slowdown in specialty pharmacy sales  Further  the sector was affected negatively due to industry wide slowdown in Hepatitis C drugs 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2016  Fred s sales increased 0 5  to  1 4 billion from same period last year  while comps decreased 1 5  versus an increase of 1 3  for the year ago period

136602,358117,ROST,Should You Buy Retail ETFs For Q4 ,opinion,"Retailing involves buying large quantities of goods and selling them in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit  The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend  Consumer spending is the key to the well being of any economy as it accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity 

	The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30  of total consumer spending in the U S  Also  the retail industry ranks among the top U S  industries and employs an enormous workforce  contributing to the health of the job market 

	Before jumping on to the trends in retail  here s a peek into the key economic indicators  which suggest where the market is heading    Read   

	Recent data reveal that U S  consumer spending rose for the fourth straight month in July  climbing 0 3  after a 0 5  rise in June  0 3  in May and 1 1  in April  This indicates that the U S  economy is poised to pick up pace in the second half of 2016  propelled by growth in domestic consumption  The report further suggests continued confidence on the part of consumers backed by a steady job market as well as low interest rates and gasoline prices  Also  the report reflects a 0 4  gain in income  higher than the figures posted in the last two months 

	Also  a report by the Commerce Department suggests that the second estimate for real gross domestic product  GDP  expanded at an annual rate of 1 1  in the second quarter of 2016  compared to the first quarter increase in real GDP of 0 8   The second estimate stands almost at par with the advance estimate of 1 2   keeping the picture of economic growth intact 

	We note that the U S  labor market looks quite stable  with unemployment rate for August remaining steady for the third straight month at 4 9   The report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that a total of 151 000 nonfarm payroll was added in August 

	While the rebounding U S  economy is making retailers optimistic  retail sales  recorded by the nation s largest retail trade group   National Retail Federation  NRF    fell 0 3  in August  following a strong June and a relatively flat July  However  the sales decline in the month was wider than market expectations of a 0 1  fall  Nevertheless  analysts believe that this is a temporary dip and consumers will continue to drive growth in the U S  economy   Read   

	Additionally  NRF had projected retail sales for 2016 to rise 3 1   which is higher than the 10 year average sales growth of 2 7   Online sales in 2016 are expected to increase in the band of 6 9  

	Market experts expect retail sales growth in 2016 to come on the back of improving wages  job creations as well as steady consumer confidence  which will negate the headwinds from an uncertain global environment

136605,358120,ROST,4 ETFs   Stocks To Treat You On Halloween And After,opinion,"Are you being spooked by the stock market volatility due to the impending presidential election or the menace caused by global growth issues 
Well  spookiness is common before Halloween  But unlike the real event  its effect on the market is not at all scary  In fact  instead of tricking investors  the Halloween Effect is usually a treat 
Halloween Effect is a historically observed increase in stock prices from the month of November through the end of April  It is exactly opposite the popular adage  sell in May and then walk away  which refers to the six months between May 1 and October 31 
Among overall buoyancy  retail sales deserve a special mention this time around  Vacations  holiday season buying  both Christmas and spring season  and seasonal optimism may play a huge role behind this surge  read    
The National Retail Federation expects total holiday sales excluding autos  gas and restaurant to expand 3 6  to  655 8 billion  a little higher than the  since 2009  Also  the International Council of Shopping Centers sees a 3 3  uptick in spending at physical stores against 2 2  gains in sales last year 
In fact  the likely rosy trend starts with Halloween itself as the event greets the fall season  And  conventional wisdom is that strong Halloween spending is an indicator of strong Christmas season spending  as per   This makes it more important to carve into the Halloween sales projection for 2016 
Spending to Touch All Time High This Halloween
National Retail Federation estimated that Americans will likely spend a staggering  on Halloween candy  costumes  and decorations this year  In the last 10 years  Halloween outlays grew about 70   crowning the event the runner up in terms of decoration sales  just after Christmas 
Costumes will take the highest share of spending though just  of consumers will likely go for them  On the other hand  94 3  will likely shell out around  2 5 billion on candies  As much as 70  of consumers will spend about  2 4 billion on decorations and 35 4  will pay out nearly  390 million on greeting cards

136697,358212,ROST,3 Bright Spots In The Brick And Morter Retail Wreckage,opinion,"As last year s holiday season was kicking off  I cautioned investors for the second year in a  to beware of the traditional retail sector  Since then  things have gone from bad to worse  This earnings season has been an unmitigated disaster  with one retailer after another turning in disappointing reports  Gap  NYSE GPS   Nordstrom  NYSE JWN   Macy s  NYSE M   JC Penney  NYSE JCP   Kohl s  NYSE KSS   and others have all dropped precipitously 
Some contrarian investors  who buy out of favor stocks in out of favor industries  have started calling a bottom for these companies  positing that the recent selloff provides an attractive entry price for long term investors 
I disagree 
Not long ago  apparel retailing was a well loved sector  When I was younger  I regularly attended presentations where middle aged  often female New York brokerage analysts would fawn over CEOs at companies like Gap  the Limited  NYSE LB   and Ann Taylor  NASDAQ ASNA  while discussing fashion trends in minute detail  Those days and those analysts are long gone  and they re not coming back 
According to Morgan Stanley   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  now accounts for 7 percent of all apparel sales  with that number expected to grow 9 11 percent in a few short years  Just as scary is the pricing power Amazon gives its users  American consumers almost always shop based on one thing and one thing only  price  We love hunting for bargains  especially when we don t have to leave our homes to do it  Even as traditional retailers continue to implement  omni channel  approaches  I just don t see how they can compete with Amazon s dominance 
All that being said  some players will survive this onslaught those that sell products where Amazon cannot and will not be a meaningful competitor  An obvious niche is deep discount   treasure hunt  chains like TJ Maxx  NYSE TJX  and Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST   Both are adept at sourcing merchandise from bankruptcies and overruns  and passing most of those savings on to their customers  Those customers are usually from a middle and lower middle class demographic  groups that are still somewhat hesitant to buy clothes over the internet  Not surprisingly  TJ and Ross are two of the best performing retail stocks of the last decade  and could continue to outperform in years ahead 
Other niche companies should survive and even thrive in this landscape  That includes Covington  LA based Pool Corp   NASDAQ POOL   which not surprisingly distributes pool and hot tub chemicals  equipment  and related products to pool store and service operations in the US  I interviewed Pool Corp s management at its corporate headquarters last week  and was fascinated to learn that despite POOL being one of the ten best performing US stocks of the last two decades  a mere eight analysts  none of whom are based in New York  write research on this world class   2 5 billion company 
Pool s typical customer operates fewer than 10 stores  These mom and pops love the extensive inventory at Pool s 330  US locations  plus the fact that the company delivers  if needed  and will extend credit 
You might be wondering  doesn t Amazon sell pool supplies  Of course it does  Amazon sells everything  But guess where Amazon sources its pool related items  Pool Corp 
That s because it does not want to keep volatile chemicals in its warehouses  While POOL s stock appears pricey at 24x earnings  the company generates lots of cash and has used buybacks to shrink its outstanding shares by over 25 percent over the last ten years 
Retail has always been an inherently risky  failure prone space for investors  In my career  I have shorted more retailers that have eventually filed for bankruptcy than companies in any other sector  That list includes Bombay  Circuit City  Edison Brothers  Factory 2 U  Gadzooks  Garden Botanika  Kmart  Stage Stores  Ultimate Electronics  Value Merchants  and Wilson Leather  The only thing that surprised me about any of these names wasn t that they went broke  but how long they managed to hold out in the meantime 
Anyone tempted by some of the downtrodden retailers in today s market would be wise to study the history of the sector before they buy  Turnarounds are exceedingly rare and bargain stocks often wind up costing a good deal ",2016-05-19,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-few-bright-spots-in-the-retail-wreckage-200130859,200130859

136743,358258,ROST,Company Notes Digest  May 23   2014,opinion,"The Macro Outlook
Home Depot spoke perhaps the four most consequential words of the week
 May sales are robust   Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD 
Mastercard also confirms that that the first few weeks of May are tracking well
 May looks like   the first couple of weeks of May looked like April more than the first quarter  So  the U S  looks like it s there in that form  Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA 
Everyone agrees that weather was to blame for Q1
 much of the U S  and Canada had an even colder spring and this had a significant impact on our sales   Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD 
Some retailers had more to blame than the weather though
 we didn t call out weather  We   based on the fact that we ve got some real issues in this industry has some very big issues in the golf business per se  and what was going on in the hunt business  we didn t   we didn t want it to look like we were hiding behind the weather  Dick s Sporting Goods Inc  NYSE DKS 
 the retail environment is changing dramatically and consumer shopping patterns are changing fundamentally  This has been particularly severe in the teen retail sector  Mall traffic remains a significant headwind as the Gen Z customer no longer needs the mall to socialize and apparel preferences continue to focus on individuality and uniqueness   Aeropostale Inc  NYSE ARO 
It s also still a promotional environment
 We continue to see that the market is promotional which is why we re working so hard as Julie said to take costs out of our supply chain and to develop inspiring and appealing products for our customer   Williams Sonoma Inc  NYSE WSM 
Ross stores argues that retailers should never blame the weather
 I think the Midwest is a good case example of why retailers should never blame the weather  We mentioned the weather because obviously it was relevant in Q1  But when we look at the Midwest  there are lots of other things that can drive your top line certainly over the period of this quarter that can trump weather   Ross Stores Inc  NASDAQ ROST 
High income consumer doing just fine
 The A malls for us are out trending the Bs and Cs  Actually from an income level  the higher income consumer group actually performed very nicely overall   Aeropostale Inc  NYSE ARO 
The middle low income consumer still having difficulties
 We re not economists  But what we know is the customer   the customer who is the moderate base customer appears to have some difficulties right now and so  if you re   the word is health  they seem to have a little bit of a health problem right now    Ross Stores Inc  NASDAQ ROST 
It s not a good sign for the average worker when companies are cutting jobs to improve productivity instead of out of financial necessity
 this actually has nothing to do with our confidence in the business  This has to do with really now understanding the opportunities that we have to make this company better we need to run this company more efficiently  not only for the benefit of cost but frankly in terms of ease of doing business  ease of working here and faster more nimble decision making  We re going to have to be quicker and faster and more nimble to compete in this new world order  And by the way having a lower cost structure is an added benefit to that   Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ

TD points out some  frightening  data points in the US mortgage market
 the overall mortgage market is clearly challenged in the U S  as you ve seen some signs that that s frightening right now in terms of application volumes through the industry and so on   Toronto Dominion Bank  The   NYSE TD 
But  anecdotally  starting to see some signs of an uptick
 on the mortgage portfolio I don t want to give you information that s not sort of solidly empirically rooted  I can tell you that anecdotally you are starting to hear about a bit of an uptick   Toronto Dominion Bank  The   NYSE TD 
There may be some signs of life for consumer credit in HELOCs
 We saw some HELOC improvement in the late part of the quarter  maybe linked to this lock in phenomenon that you hear about where people don t want to move because they are locked into really low rates  but they are renovating and improving their current houses and so on   Toronto Dominion Bank  The   NYSE TD 
Credit quality can t stay strong forever  but good times may still have legs
 Credit has continued to be strong and more favorable than we expected across our retail and commercial portfolios and on both sides of the border  We said before  this trend cannot continue indefinitely  but it may have a while to go   Toronto Dominion Bank  The   NYSE TD 
50  of transactions in the US are still in cash
 even in the U S   50  of the transactions are still with cash  So it s not as in the U S  has converted electronic payments ubiquitously  in fact  the only countries that have really done that well are the Nordics and Korea  for reasons of government support and pushing it  But everybody else  U S  50   Brazil is 80   Japan is 80  cash  Germany is 80  cash   Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA

Toronto Dominion says that Target s fortunes are improving too
 we are already starting to see Target sales improving   Toronto Dominion Bank  The   NYSE TD 
It s hard to make money in e commerce selling a low AUR product
 Secondly  e commerce  so  we continue to look at e commerce  We run a business that has a  10 average unit retail  And when we put together the economics currently  we think it s very hard for people to make money  Not just shipping cost but return cost  processing cost  marketing cost etcetera   Ross Stores Inc  NASDAQ ROST 
There may have been some slowing in home related spending
 you ve got changes in the sectors  furniture and furnishings and fixtures which were very strong a year and a half ago which was how I started calling out that housing was recovering in earnings calls  that seems to have slowed down which kind of fits exactly what s going on in the housing market right now   Mastercard Incorporated  NYSE MA 
Kitchen remodeling was a hallmark of the housing boom
 if you go back to 2005 and 2006  one of the categories that was really the hallmark of turns and sales were special order kitchens  people would buy home  they would invest in the kitchen  they do upgrades and then they turn the home  That s actually the category for us that got hit the hardest over the housing crash   Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD 
Today people aren t taking on quite as ambitious projects
 you got to make sure the infrastructure of your home is right  you may paint  you may do some gardening  So I think it s going to be different as we go through this housing recovery than what we saw at the height of the housing market  Home Depot Inc  NYSE HD 
If you re in the market for golf clubs now is probably a pretty good time to buy
 The more concerning and unpredictable issue is the golf business  We anticipated softness  but instead we saw significant decline We don t feel we found that bottom yet in the golf sales number we plan to aggressively manage our higher than planned inventory level so that as we enter the back half of the year we are well positioned for the holiday season  Dick s Sporting Goods Inc  NYSE DKS

HP seeing signs of stabilization in PC market

Consumer laptop sales grew slightly for the first time in nearly 4 years
 consumer notebook revenue grew slightly for the first time since the fiscal 2010 third quarter   Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ

There needs to be a big increase in ag productivity to meet growing global demand for corn
 We have around  globally around 300 million acres of productive corn acres globally and in order to meet this 500 to 600 million bushel a year increase in demand  We would have to increase productivity on those acres by 2  a year  So we ve never done that before  That s never happened  Monsanto Company  NYSE MON 
Can t meet new demand by bringing on new acres of arable land
 we re not to be able to bring significant amount of new acres into production  It s going to have to come from productivity on the acres that we have or a shift in acres from other crops into corn   Monsanto Company  NYSE MON

136745,358260,ROST,Sears Skyrockets On REIT Plan,opinion,"Shares of Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD  gained over 31  Monday after the cash strapped broad line retailer revealed through a Securities   Exchange Commission  SEC  filing that it is forming a Real Estate Investment Trust  REIT   in a bid to enhance its financial flexibility and improve operating performance  The company will issue rights offering of this planned REIT to its current shareholders 
Sears Holdings stated that it will sell about 200 to 300 stores to the newly formed REIT and lease them back  With this sale leaseback deal  Sears Holdings will be able to continue its operations at these locations while generating substantial proceeds from them 
Revenue of a REIT company mostly comes either from rent or mortgage payments  The companies have an obligation to distribute at least 90  of its taxable income to the investors in the form of dividend  A REIT company does not have to pay taxes at corporate level 
The company s recent move suggests that it is strategically enhancing its liquidity position well ahead of the holiday shopping season  We believe that this will help Sears Holdings to assure vendors of its capability to pay for merchandises in spite of deteriorating sales and widening losses 
Of late  Sears Holdings has been grappling with deteriorating top and bottom line performances  However  we commend the company s efforts to improve its financial performance and liquidity position through various strategic measures  including the last month s move of raising approximately  625 million through a right offering of 8  unsecured senior notes  maturing in 2019  along with leasing seven retail locations to Primark 
In the beginning of fiscal 2014  the beleaguered retailer had set a target of raising its liquidity position by  1 billion  which it fulfilled from the recent  400 million loan from ESL investment and approximately  665 million raised by spinning off its Land s End Inc   NASDAQ LE  business and sale of some properties  Apart from this  the company  in early October  raised  380 million through right offerings of its stake in the Canadian subsidiary  Sears Canada 
Furthermore  Sears Holding  which currently sells products through store based networks  is looking for opportunities to transform its business to a member centric model through its Shop Your Way program  Sears Holdings is also focusing on cost containment  inventory management and merchandise enhancement initiatives to turn its losses into profit 
We believe that these strategies have the potential to bring the company back on growth trajectory but it still has a long way to cover

136767,358282,ROST,What Rate Of Return Should You Expect From Your Stocks  Part 2  ,opinion,In Part 1 of this series found here  we voiced the notion that there are two primary attributes  valuation and the rate of change of earnings growth  which prudent investors can use to forecast the potential future returns on their stocks  However  Part 1 was primarily focused on ascertaining the principles which laid the foundation for sound current valuation    In this Part 2  we will focus on how to utilize current valuation in conjunction with earnings growth rates in order to come up with a reasonable expectation of the future total returns a stock can be expected to provide  The point is that neither can be looked at in isolation  In other words  the price you pay to buy the growth that the company ultimately delivers  will determine not only how much money you make  the percentage return on investment   but how much risk you took to make it    Moreover  in Part 1  we concerned ourselves with defining historical norms relating to valuation  and then provided historical evidence to back them up  But even more importantly  we strove to illustrate that there is a practical rationale that underpinned our calculations of soundness  This practical rationale is the calculation of the earnings yield  earnings divided by price  that a given valuation  PE ratio  represents    The general idea here is that a company s profitability ought to represent an acceptable rate of return on your investment  After all  when all is said and done  when you  invest  in a common stock you are buying the business  If that business isn t making enough money to give you a decent return on your investment  then common sense would indicate that you re overpaying for it    Another way of looking at this is to understand and acknowledge that a business gets its value from the amount of cash flow it is capable of generating for its stakeholders  owners or shareholders   At this point  it s important that the reader recognizes the previous statement as a metaphor    In other words  we are using the word  cash flow  to represent the amount of money the business is making you if you are an owner  Furthermore  in the context of this article we consider the word  cash flow  as interchangeable with profits or earnings  Our objective is to focus on the essence of valuation so that the principle can be understood  and not get caught up in semantics or accounting convention    Analogy of a Hypothetical Private Company With this in mind  we offer the following analogy  Let s assume that you own a private business that pays you  100 000 a year of income  salary  dividends  bonuses  etc    We will also assume that your business provides a guaranteed  100 000 per year in income  no risk and no growth  Furthermore  we also assume that you live in the perfect society with no taxes  Remember  our objective is to focus on the essence of valuation    Now let s further assume that you are tired of working and want to sell the business  The seminal question is at what price will you be willing to sell   The logical answer would be at some reasonable multiple of one year s worth of your earnings  Put another way  if a business generates a predictable annual income stream  it has a value greater than that income stream  even at zero growth  Because logically  if you sold the business for only  100 000  or one times earnings  you would be out of money in one year    Therefore  in order to sell  you would need a multiple of one year s earnings that you can use to provide yourself a comparable future income stream in your new retirement  If we use the multiple of 15  a PE of 15   our standard of value presented in Part 1  we would get a selling price of  1 500 000    Now  if we could invest the  1 500 000 into a passive investment  Bond  CD  Public Dividend Paying Stock  etc   at our established historically reasonable return of 6 66   PE 15   we discover that our income would be  99 900 per year  approximately  100 000 per year   Note  This provides some insight into the underlying reason for a normal PE of 15  because the historical average annual return on stocks has been approximately somewhere between 6 9   Therefore  the return a 15 PE represents is both believable and historically achievable    Consequently  both the seller and buyer in our metaphorical analogy would be provided a sound and reasonable return  The seller can take the proceeds and generate a future return adequate enough to provide a comfortable retirement  and the buyer simultaneously is earning a reasonable return on their investment in the operating business  The point is that the income stream is driving the value  and it s the income stream that gives a business its worth  whether it s a publicly traded stock on an exchange  or private    Risk  Return and the Valuation Relationships   Thus far  we have established a baseline of valuation using a hypothetical guaranteed and static income stream no risk and no growth  However  in the real world  a business  income stream is neither static nor guaranteed  Furthermore  the more dynamic the income stream  the more risk associated with achieving it    Some cases in point would include the notions that faster growth is harder to achieve than slower growth  and consistent growth would be generally considered more predictable than cyclical growth  Therefore  we now introduce two new concepts  risk and compounding  Risk will tend to lower or reduce the valuation a prudent investor is willing to pay for a given investment  and a higher rate of earnings growth tends to increase future value  compounding     Therefore  risk and earnings growth rates will represent counteracting forces affecting starting or current valuation  PE s   This partially explains why a 3  grower  less risky to achieve  might command the same current valuation PE of  for example  an 11  or 12  grower  riskier and harder to achieve   But this is a critical point  the faster grower will generate a higher future return than the slower grower  ceteris paribas    Pictures Are Worth a Thousand Words   From this point forward  we are going to rely on  earnings and price correlated graphs and performance charts to vividly express the valuation and return relationships  Therefore  the following pictures will more succinctly articulate the principles this series of articles has been developing  But for the reader to receive any insights from the graphics  a few words of explanation on them is in order   The orange earnings justified valuation lines on each graph are calculated by applying widely accepted formulas commonly utilized to value a business  There is no manipulation or adjustments made  The PE ratios represented are calculated and applied for the time period graphed The slope of the orange earnings justified line is equal to the calculated earnings growth rate  Importantly  although the PE may be the same or similar for two respective companies  the growth rate  slope of the line  can differ dramatically  this is a key to return calculations  The calculated PE ratio on each graph is the same for every point on the graph  The applicable PE is listed to the right of each graph in orange letters with the formula designation  GDF for Graham Dodd Formula  PEG for PEG ratio  PE Growth Rate  and GDF PEG representing an extrapolation between the other two The dark blue line is a calculated blended normal  historical  PE  In other words  the PE that the market has actually applied to the company historically The light blue shaded area represents dividends paid out of the green shaded area earnings  Dividends  if any  represent an important component of the total return calculation To interpret the graphs correctly  the reader must look to the right of the graph for essential mathematical factors that apply to each respective company For illustration purposes  we strove to provide examples where valuations were aligned at both the beginning and the end of each time period  or at least approximately so  This allows the reader to more clearly see the relationship between earnings growth and return over time From this point forward additional insights into historical valuation and return calculations and future estimates of both will be interjected by example with each subsequent graph  Generally  we will start with lower growth and move to faster growth with each following example    Examples of the PE   15 Standard for Earnings Growth Rates from 0  to 15    Vectren Corp   VVC   A Low Growth Utility   Our first example looks at Vectren Corp s historical earnings  a utility with a 15 year historical earnings growth rate that is below our 3  threshold established in Part 1  Note that fair valuation is calculated using Graham Dodd s Formula  GDF  deriving a fair value PE of 13 8  slightly below  but close to our PE 15 standard   However  a normal PE of 16 has been historically applied by Mr  Market  Therefore  valuation falls between a PE of 13 8 to 16  or well within a range of normalcy With our second graph we introduce and overlay monthly closing stock price  Here we discover that for the most part  price tracks earnings within the corridor of the orange and the blue line  This provides historical evidence of the practical reality of a normal PE of 15  plus or minus a minor deviation from time to time for a slow  or almost no growth  company  However  this example also provides historical evidence that the earnings growth rate drives the capital appreciation component of total return as we will discover when we review the performance table next When analyzing the performance associated with Vectren Corp  we learn that capital appreciation  closing annualized rate of return  of 1 2  closely matches earnings growth of 1 7   Thereby  we establish that the rate of change of earnings growth relates closely to capital appreciation  So now we have one important piece of the return puzzle  earnings growth  Also  since beginning valuation was approximately at a PE of 16  blue normal PE line  and so was ending valuation  little valuation adjustment to capital appreciation applies This example also provides important insight into the relevance of dividends to total return  Although we will expand on dividends in more detail with future examples  we learn here that dividends provide a return in addition to capital appreciation from earnings growth  see circles on the table   Note that this is a main reason that FAST Graphs expresses dividends on top of earnings even though they are paid out of earnings  Dividends  paid out and not reinvested in the table  provide additional return above appreciation Nextera Energy  NEE   A Moderately Growing UtilityWith our second example we move up the food chain of growth by reviewing Nextera Energy a moderately faster growing utility stock  Even though Nextera Energy s growth rate is more than 3 times faster  averaging 6 4  per annum  we discover that valuation within our PE   15 range  To be clear  what this tells us is that investing in Nextera at a PE ratio of approximately 15 represents a sound and historically normal valuation  However  we also once again see evidence that a reasonable current valuation represents soundness  but as we will soon see  the rate of change of earnings growth will determine our actual future returns  As you review the graphic  note that whenever the price line deviates from the orange earnings justified valuation line  it inevitably comes back into alignment with fair value  Therefore  the slope of the line at 6 4  becomes the driver of the capital appreciation component of return when valuation is aligned at the beginning and the ending time period measured When reviewing the performance table associated with the Nextera Energy graphic above  we once again see a very close correlation and relationship between earnings growth and capital appreciation at approximately 6  per annum  Moreover  we discover that the dividend growth rate also coincides very closely with earnings growth over time  And  we once again see that dividends  not reinvested  represent additional return We believe the real takeaway here is that sound valuation coupled with a company s earnings growth rate will allow the investor to earn a return that equates with the company s earnings growth  However  if the company pays dividends  they will represent a return kicker above and beyond earnings growth  On the other hand  the rate of dividend growth and earnings growth will generally correlate  ceteris paribus  all things remaining equal   VF Corp   VFC   Leading Apparel CompanyWith our third example  VF Corp   we again move further up the growth chain where earnings growth has averaged 8 6  per annum  Again  we discover that the PE   15 standard continues to apply  However  for companies growing between 5  15  the extrapolated formula mentioned above automatically calculates fair value  From the graphic  it is clear that a 15 PE represents a reasonable proxy for fair valuation At this point  we find it appropriate to interject the idea that fair valuation is not an absolute  Instead  it should be thought of as a reasonable range of soundness that can be utilized to make fair value investing decisions  In this example  we also discover that the normal PE ratio that Mr  Market has typically applied to VF Corp  is 13 1  slightly below our PE   15 standard  The only logical reason that we can surmise for this adjustment  is the possibility of the market s perception of risk Nevertheless  it should be clear from the graphic that a PE ratio ranging between 13 15 has historically applied to this company  In other words  armed with this information  the prudent investor might only consider investing in this company when the PE ratio is at 13 or lower  On the other hand  as we will soon see  a PE of 15 would not be a disastrous idea Once again we see a high correlation between earnings growth and capital appreciation  However  notice the effect that an expanding payout ratio has had on total dividends  and therefore  total return Hormel Foods Corp With this next example  we move closer to the upper end of our range of earnings growth where we have discovered that a PE ratio of 15 normally applies as a reasonable valuation measurement  However  we also see that the market has generally rewarded this faster and rather consistent earnings growth rate with a premium PE ratio of 17 2  Consequently  and as with this example  faster growth does warrant a higher valuation  as many may have suspected  the 15 PE still offers a proxy for valuation  On the other hand  you could pay up to 17 times earnings or slightly higher  and still earn a decent return on a company with this growth rate  Remember  valuation serves as a guide  not an absolute  Also  in this case  the consistent rate of above average growth provided by a food company providing basic human needs may be considered less risky than an apparel stock When evaluating the performance on Hormel Foods Company  we continue to see a strong correlation between earnings and return  However  a slight overvaluation at the beginning  see red circle  reduced capital appreciation from an expected 11 8  that mirrored earnings growth to only 9 5   This casts a bright light on the importance and power of earnings growth as it relates to long term return  In other words  an above average growth rate can overcome a moderately bad valuation decision in the long run  And dividends can mitigate a moderately poor investing decision even more Growth of 15  Per Annum or Better An Inflection PointAs we discussed in Part 1  historical evidence and logic imply that the normal PE ratio of approximately 15 is a reasonable proxy for fair valuation on many companies  However  we ve also attempted to illustrate that fair valuation alone does not indicate a strong return  Instead  fair or sound valuation will allow you to earn a return that equates  approximates  to the company s earnings growth rate over time  plus dividends  if any Our observations of thousands of companies utilizing the earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool   have led us to conclude and discover that once earnings growth exceeds 15  per annum  fair valuation reaches an inflection point  We believe that this is predominantly a function of the power of compounding  Once a company s growth rate exceeds 15  per annum  the stream of income that it produces  past or future  expands geometrically Therefore  our research indicates that fair valuation rises above the PE 15 standard and begins approximating the company s earnings growth rate up to growth between 35  and 40  per annum  Above 40  earnings growth rates  valuation ratios begin to blur  We believe this is attributed to the enormous risk associated with achieving such high rates of growth  Consequently  the market as a general rule will discount growth rates above 40  by applying a lower PE ratio Ross Stores Inc Our first example of high growth is Ross Stores Inc   ROST  that has averaged earnings growth of 17 6   indicating a fair value PEG ratio PE of 17 6  However  and interestingly  notice that the normal PE ratio sits close to our standard PE ratio of 15  In this case  a PE of 15 might represent a risk adjusted valuation below the higher earnings growth of 17 6   Nevertheless  buying this stock at a PE of 17 still delivers a strong long term rate of return Current overvaluation  indicated by the current blended PE ratio of 20 1 explains capital appreciation above earnings growth of 17 6   Furthermore  due to the power of compounding  although dividends contribute to total return  capital appreciation provides the majority of shareholder returns in this example Church   Dwight Inc Church   Dwight Inc   CHD  provides almost the identical growth rates of our Ross Stores  example above  However  notice how the market in this case has applied a premium historical PE ratio of 19 7 that is greater than the earnings growth rate of 17 7   We believe this indicates a lower risk premium applied to this consumer staples company over a riskier retailer such as Ross Stores Once again  we see that an above average rate of return correlates very closely to this company s above average earnings growth rate  Since valuation was sound at the beginning  and since Church   Dwight is moderately overvalued currently  annualized total return exceeds earnings growth rate Oracle Corp  Fast Growing Software CompanyOracle  ORCL  offers several lessons on how to calculate the returns from your common stock investments  First of all  we see a strong correlation between earnings and stock price for most of the 15 year time frame  However  we also see the extreme and unwarranted overvaluation that occurred during the irrationally exuberant technology bubble of the late 1990s Although Oracle is currently undervalued based on its historical earnings growth  we still see that long term returns relate to the company s earnings growth rate  discounted by undervaluation We thought it would be useful towards understanding the theme of this series of articles to look at what impact overvaluation had on Oracle s long term returns since 2001  From the following graph we can see that valuation was very high at the time Consequently  extreme overvaluation almost totally wiped out long term shareholder returns even though earnings growth was strong  However  notice that earnings growth has fallen from 19 6  over the 15 year period to 14 5  over the 12 year period  Earnings growth is a dynamic concept and fair valuation is therefore fluid as well Liquidity Services Inc   LQDT Our final example of fast growth looks at Liquidity Services Inc  Although somewhat cyclical  we see that stock prices have tracked earnings growth very closely  Moreover  we see that the market has typically applied a fair value PE ratio that equates very closely with the company s earnings growth rate  thereby providing additional evidence of the validity of the PE equals growth rate valuation concept applies to fast growth above 15  Cyclical Stocks but the Valuation Rules Continue to ApplyThe following example looking at Cooper Cos  Inc   COO   and reveals a very cyclical company that provides insight into the PE equals 15 hypotheses that this series of articles has presented  Clearly  price follows earnings even when earnings are dropping  and interestingly  the market tends to apply our standard PE equals 15 even when this happens  Summary ConclusionsOur goals with this series of articles  was to establish a framework  and hopefully insights  into how an investor can know what rate of return to expect from their stocks  Simply stated  it s a function of valuation coupled with earnings growth  Unfortunately  time and space only allowed us to scratch the surface of these important investor concepts  Therefore  a Part 3 addendum to this series is in order that will primarily deal with forecasting future returns based on these principles  However  we are hopeful that the essence of return was adequately expressed thus far Furthermore  in order to receive the maximum insight and benefit from this series  it s imperative that the reader spend the majority of their time analyzing and evaluating the graphics presented  These FAST Graphs not only express the relationships to return that were offered  they simultaneously provide historical evidence of the veracity of the hypotheses as well Finally  and most importantly  the reader should keep in mind that what was discussed here represents ranges as well as nuances of valuation and return  These are multifaceted concepts that are also adjusted by risk as we attempted to iterate  Therefore  these concepts should serve more as guides  In other words  these concepts provide practical guidelines  but they lack perfect precision  mostly due to

largest off price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1 072 locations in 33 states  the District of Columbia and Guam  Ross offers first quality  in season  name brand and designer apparel  accessories  footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20  to 60  off department and specialty store regular prices  The Company also operates 102 dd s DISCOUNTS  in eight states that feature a more moderately priced assortment of first quality  in season  name brand apparel  accessories  footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20  to 70  off moderate department and discount store regular prices  Earnings Determine Market Price   The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Earnings   Price Correlated Fundamentals at a GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Ross Stores Inc shows a picture of overvaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 19 6   orange circle  and a current PE of 21 3  red circle   Another interesting note is that Ross  price follows its Historical PE of 15 rather than following its Operating Earnings Growth Rate of 19 6   In other words  the market has historically applied a discounted valuation to Ross Store s relative to its earnings growth At the bottom of the graph you can see that earnings have grown from  0 36 per share in 1998  to an estimate of  3 46 per share for 2012  see green highlighted earnings at the bottom of the graph   with a slight hiccup in 2004 and 2005  yellow highlighting   As an aside  you can note from the graph that this is the highest valuation or price that you were asked to pay to buy a  1 dollar s worth of Ross Stores  earnings since 1998  In other words  Ross Stores  stock appears expensive today based on historical earnings growth Ross Stores Inc   Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 1998Performance Table Ross Stores IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 20 4  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Ross Stores Inc  assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  410 17 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 20 4  to 20 6   orange highlighting  per annum versus 3 7   red circle  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Ross Stores Inc is 1 68 which is historically normal  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 8 1   and when you look at the forecasting graph below  the stock appears overvalued   it s outside of the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth   The consensus of 23 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Ross Stores Inc s long term earnings growth at 14 7   orange circle   Ross Stores Inc has low long term debt at 9  of capital  red circle   Ross Stores Inc is currently trading at a P E of 21 3  which is above the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18 but a fair value of a P E 15  see orange lines   If the earnings materialize as forecast  Ross Stores Inc s True Worth  valuation would be  99 78 at the end of 2017  brown circle on EYE Chart   which would be a 8 1  annual rate of return from the current price  yellow highlighting  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows   All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Ross Stores Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Ross Stores Inc s expected earnings would be 5 9  purple circle  times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary   ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although  with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not

136769,358284,ROST,September Trading Introduces New Risks For Bulls,opinion,With the summer officially over  traders are returning to a challenging environment  Equity indices are within striking distance of 52 week highs  having spent the summer grinding higher on incredibly light volume  At the same time  the global economy is teetering on the brink of recession  with a number of serious macro risks lurking  The political spectrum creates just as much uncertainty as the economic picture  can one really separate the two   as politicians around the globe struggle to come up with credible solutions to the various situations  In Europe  Germany is now entering a recessionary environment  and yet the country is expected to be instrumental in bailing out their debt ridden neighbors  Chinese politicians have limited resources to fight an increasingly likely hard landing  And in the US  the Fed is trying to determine whether another round of quantitative easing would be worthwhile  Sentiment has been steadily moving higher with AAII  American Association of Individual Investors  readings now decidedly bullish  The Barron s cover story this week    depicts a bulletproof bull  and the market s lethargic price action has essentially lulled investors into a state of complacency  Ironically  confidence levels have risen despite the fact that markets have not broken to new highs  While the short term path of least resistance still favors the bulls  a grind to new highs is still a high probability outcome   a bearish break is still very much in the cards  Moreover  while a grind higher environment offers modest profit opportunity for traders  a major price dislocation would catch investors off guard and could lead to tremendous trading opportunities for the bears  as fearful investors and traders try to reduce exposure quickly   in a period of extremely low liquidity  We re entering the new month with moderately bearish exposure  given the asymmetrical reward to risk profile of the current environment  We still have plenty of room to add additional exposure  whether through traditional equity trades  futures or forex positions  or structured option setups  We re looking forward to the new month of trading  with the potential to break out of this listless environment of low volume  low volatility price action  Below are a few of the areas we are focused on for the week ahead  Emerging Markets Moving From Bad to Worse The global economic slowdown is hitting emerging markets especially hard  With demand from developed markets under pressure  the export based emerging market economies are struggling to maintain growth levels  Given the heavy infrastructure investments that many of these countries have made  such as entire Chinese cities built and yet to be populated  the global slowdown comes at a particularly challenging time  While US equities have been steadily advancing  emerging market equity indices have been severely underperforming  We are currently short the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets  EEM  with unrealized profits already built into the position  Any stall for US equities would only exacerbate the situation for emerging market equities  as a flight from risk assets would certainly include additional liquidation of emerging equities as well  The ripple effect from slowing developed countries  to emerging markets  also extends to resource rich Australia  We ve been discussing the danger to the Australian dollar for some time now  booking profits earlier in the year on a short trade  and building a material short position in the currency again over the last few weeks  Our position is in the AUD USD currency pair which allows for very efficient use of capital in expressing the trade  The Currency Shares Australian Dollar  FXA    or related option contracts   can also get the job done  but these securities require significantly more capital per unit of true exposure  At any rate  the price action in the aussie is once again turning south with plenty of potential for acceleration as we enter September  Just a few months ago  the AUD USD pair was trading in the 0 96 range  and in 2008  the pair hit a low near 0 80  AUD USD Chart  title  AUD USD Chart  width  782  height  358   Dividend Plays Overvalued and Sinking Last week we talked about how investors  reach for yield has pushed prices of utility stocks to vulnerable valuations  Both retail and institutional investors have migrated to equities that pay high dividends  which is a direct result of the Fed s zero interest rate policy   leading to high fixed income prices  and correspondingly low yields  In addition to utilities  many consumer staple bellwether stocks are also trading at high historical valuations  and heading lower as fixed income yields start rising  adding more competition for yield oriented capital   Altria Group Inc   MO   the former Philip Morris  is a great example of an over valued dividend stock   now heading in the wrong direction  The stock pays a 5  yield  but also trades at nearly 15 times earnings  This is the type of multiple you would typically see from a stable growth company   not a mature cash cow operation  As interest rates begin to edge higher  and both corporate as well as treasury security yields follow suit  investors will have to weigh the additional risk of holding equity  versus debt   and determine if the additional income from dividends justifies the underlying capital gain loss risk  Altria s chart looks particularly ominous after years of steadily trending higher  Last week  we initiated a new short position after the stock broke down and then briefly drifted higher   Safe  Capital Rotating Into US Domestic Stocks As the global economy downshifts into neutral  and emerging market valuations continue to drop  portfolio managers are looking for stability in US domestic stocks  Large cap multinational companies may offer broad diversification  but with weakness around the world  this diversification winds up being a liability rather than an asset  Ironically  this trend favors niche US small and mid cap stocks that operate stable businesses and can demonstrate the ability to grow even in this challenging environment  The retail apparel group has been a mixed bag lately in terms of stock performance  Stock prices for a number of over valued retailers have dropped as brands have fallen out of favor  while other retailers such as TJX Cos Inc   TJX  and Ross Stores Inc   ROST  have continued to push to new highs  More specifically  the footwear area has been improving in recent months as evidenced by a 33  rise in Steve Madden Ltd   SHOO  as well as a 15  rebound for Nike Inc   NKE   One potential bull candidate on our roster is Deckers Outdoor Corp   DECK   The company has several well respected footwear brands  and generates more than 2 3 of its revenue in the US  DECK is currently trading at a single digit forward PE  listed at 9 43  with an expected growth rate close to 19   The stock has rebounded 25  from its July low  but still sits at less than half its valuation from late last year  As capital rotates into safe domestic plays   companies that are generating strong cash flow and have reasonable valuations   Deckers should continue to rebound  advancing significantly before raising any red flags for value investors   Precious metal prices  along with stock prices for PM miners  have been moving sharply higher over the last few weeks  Despite the recent strength  we re skeptical of the action and remain on the sidelines  The precious metal advances are largely fueled by expectations for additional liquidity injections  from both sides of the Atlantic   and are certainly helped by the tailwind of a weakening US dollar  But taking an objective view of the situation  it s difficult to see how the Fed could justify a massive liquidity program with equities hitting new highs  and the presidential election just around the corner  This isn t to say that there won t be any action during the Fed meeting later this month  but the magnitude of any announced program could turn out to be underwhelming   sparking a sharp selloff for precious metals  Considering this risk  the current rally looks quite dangerous and we re content to watch the action from afar  In terms of catalysts this week  traders will be particularly attuned to the ADP and August payroll reports   scheduled for Thursday and Friday mornings respectively  We re still in a situation where bad news could be perceived as a positive  forcing the Fed s hand   while continued improvement in the job market could raise concern for the bullish camp  We re locked and loaded with our bearish exposure in play and our risk points giving positions some wiggle room but keeping our total risk in check  Disclosure  This content is general info only  not to be taken as investment advice  Click here for  ,2012-09-04,Mercenary
