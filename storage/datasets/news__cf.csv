148333,369849,CF,Farm Deluge Starts to Seep Into America s Fragile Rural Economy,news," Bloomberg     From 100 feet  30 meters  up in the air  Indiana crop duster Robert Sneberger gets a better view than most of how cornfields are faring  This season  the picture is bleak 
Instead of the stretching green stalks he normally sees at this time of year  there s water  The wettest year in memory has stalled planting and stunted crops in the U S  Midwest at a time when farmers are already struggling with low prices and a trade war with China 
But they re not alone  The communities they live in and the businesses that supply them with seeds  fertilizer  equipment and services are struggling as credit conditions steadily deteriorate in a fragile rural economy  At Burrus Seed in Arenzville  Illinois  employees spend as much time trying to lift farmers  spirits as they do selling to them  according to the owner 
 If we experienced a year like this  I don t remember it   said Todd Burrus  whose family has run the company since 1935   When the farm economy is tough  it s going to be tough for all the suppliers  
Another Illinois seed business owner  Kurt Barman  says he s trying not to curtail employee hours even as customers are returning product because they aren t able to plant   All of the seeds are coming back  so that s lost revenue for us   he said 
The wet weather is presenting farmers with other purchasing dilemmas  Growers are weighing whether to trade up to the latest technology to protect crops and businesses  or use prior versions  according to Mark Patrick  chief financial officer of agro chemical giant  Syngenta  AG  OTC SYENF  
 Couple that with less acres  you ve got a very acute pressure going on at the moment   Patrick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television 
The fertilizer business is already feeling the effects  Midwest urea premiums have been running at more than double normal levels  While that s good news for suppliers  the reason behind the price surge isn t 
With the Mississippi River closed for much of the past month  the regular flow of crop nutrient shipments has been disrupted with barges stacked up waiting to move  according to Alexis Maxwell  research director for Bloomberg Green Markets 
Deerfield  Illinois based CF Industries Holdings Inc  NYSE CF   produces urea locally  while Nutrien Ltd  has urea it can bring in from the Canadian Prairies  Overseas providers have been the ones suffering as they try and get their product to the Midwest 
The deluge is just the latest blow to the farm economy  Even the  28 billion in promised tariff aid may not be enough to rescue rural America from the onslaught of bad news 
There s been a steady deterioration in agricultural credit conditions  the Kansas City Federal Reserve said in its May report  Farmer sentiment has plunged to levels not seen since October 2016  the month before Donald Trump s election victory  a Purdue University CME Group index showed this month  Net farm income last year was about half of the  123 billion earned in 2013 
The stalled planting this year only works to exacerbate fragility in rural areas  Curt Hudnutt  head of North American rural banking for Rabobank   If you want to liken it to the 2008 recession from a housing perspective  it s similar to that and it s really vulnerable to any disruptions    he said 
Shawn Kelly  mayor of Missouri Valley  Iowa  says the weather is casting a shadow over the corn driven local economy  where average incomes are already well below the national average 
 Any time you have a big economic impact from agriculture like that where people can t get their crops in  there s going to be less money for people to spend   Mayor Kelly said 
The deluge has had a far more direct impact on Hamburg  The southwest Iowa town    home to a John Deere dealership  a Manildra plant and Vogel Popcorn    was inundated by Missouri River flooding and has had to take on debt to recover from the devastation and reconnect water and gas supply to homes 
 We used to have a really healthy bottom line   Mayor Cathy Crain said in an interview   As of two months ago  we have spent it all and are now living on and operating on borrowed dollars  
Price  Godsend 
There are some bright spots  Chicago corn futures have rallied about 30  since early May  so farmers that were able to plant and get decent yields can expect better returns  Brad Moffitt  director of market development at the Ohio Corn   Wheat Association  said 
Worries of a smaller corn harvest have prompted ethanol plants and animal feeders to bid more aggressively for supplies leftover from last year  In parts of Indiana and Ohio that had some of the biggest planting delays  so called basis bids for corn are the highest in years  The basis is the amount below or above futures that buyers are willing to pay 
That means elevators that still have corn can sell at higher prices 
 In terms of the effect on the old crop  both price and basis  it s been a godsend    Philip Luce  a grain merchandising specialist at advisory service White Commercial Corp  in Stuart  Florida  said by telephone   Unfortunately  usually you get these prices when there s a production problem   
The reason for this year s production problem is all too apparent for Sneberger  whose company Aerial Farmer sprays fertilizers and pesticides   I was just flying over the fields yesterday and I was completely depressed  
Craig Woodley  a pilot who owns Woodley Aerial Spray in Walnut  Illinois  said he s trying to figure out how to save money  since he s still not sure how busy he ll be this summer 
 It s a scary picture   Woodley said   There s definitely going to be a lot of lives affected  ",2019-06-23,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/farm-deluge-starts-to-seep-into-americas-fragile-rural-economy-1905214,1905214

148348,369864,CF,Good news from China could boost materials shares,news,"By April Joyner NEW YORK  Reuters    Even as the lift from optimism over prospects for U S  China trade detente shows signs of wearing off for the wider U S  stock market  upbeat sentiment around China s economy could bolster shares of materials companies  Shares of S P 500 industrial and technology companies  which were buffeted by last year s tit for tat tariffs as well as slowing global demand  have been very responsive to progress in U S  China trade relations and a strengthening Chinese economy  This year  those sectors have outpaced the ascent in the S P 500  which reached a record closing high on Tuesday  Materials stocks have not been as sensitive  however  even though they also stand to benefit as a stronger Chinese economy lifts global consumption and industrial output  As China has taken measures to stimulate its economy  its economic data have turned more upbeat  That in turn could aid global growth  which has flagged as a result of China s cooldown   What we re seeing is China spending more on stimulus  fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus   said Kristina Hooper  chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York   That s likely to be a positive for materials   The People s Bank of China has cut banks  reserve requirement ratio five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs  The stimulus appears to have boosted Chinese economic data  with factory activity growing in March for the first time in four months  Yet so far in 2019  the S P 500 materials index has underperformed the S P 500 at large  rising just 11 9  compared with 16 7  for the benchmark index  Moreover  it is among the biggest decliners in the period since the S P s previous record closing level on Sept  20  The materials index has fallen 7  over those seven months  versus a 5 2  gain for technology and a 3  loss for industrials  Only the energy index has dropped more over that period  A trade agreement could serve as a catalyst for a bump in materials shares as a drag on China s economy is lifted  some market strategists say  Some commodity prices  including those for copper and oil  have ascended this year as the prospects for the global economy have somewhat brightened   It all goes back to the global growth outlook   said Andrea DiCenso  portfolio manager for alpha strategies at Loomis Sayles in Boston   With the front run in hard data  we re beginning to see a pretty significant rally   Additionally  a trade agreement is expected to include commitments from China to purchase higher quantities of U S  products such as soybeans  which could benefit companies that make agricultural chemicals  including DowDuPont Inc and CF Industries Holdings Inc  NYSE CF   CF Industries is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday  and DowDuPont is scheduled to report before the market open on Thursday  To be sure  even with a trade agreement  some materials companies could face price pressures  Shares of Freeport McMoRan Inc fell 10 1  on Thursday after the copper mining company posted a lower than expected profit as its production slipped and its costs rose  A rollback of tariffs on Chinese imports  particularly aluminum and steel  would likely prompt a fall in some commodity prices  which could hurt prospects for certain materials companies  said Gene Goldman  chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management in El Segundo  California  Even so  those drawbacks may be outweighed by the support for global demand fostered by a U S  China trade agreement

148476,369992,CF,CF Industries  profit plunges 44 percent  shares drop,news," Reuters    U S  fertilizer producer CF Industries  N CF  reported a 44 percent drop in third quarter profit on Wednesday  a steeper than expected fall 
Shares of CF  the world s No  2 nitrogen fertilizer maker after Norway s Yara International ASA  OL YAR   dropped more than 4 percent after normal trading hours in New York  They had closed at  253 63 
Chief Executive Tony Will said the higher cost of natural gas  a key input in nitrogen fertilizer production  contributed to the drop in profit  Higher storage costs also reduced earnings 
Net earnings fell to  130 9 million  or  2 62 a share  from  234 1 million  or  4 07 a share  a year earlier 
Net sales for the Deerfield  Illinois  company dropped 16 percent to  921 4 million  reflecting the sale of CF s phosphate business to Mosaic Co  N MOS   CF s nitrogen sales volume rose 6 percent  with half of the increase due to a contract with Mosaic 
Analysts  on average  had expected CF to earn  3 47 a share on sales of  932 4 million  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
A drop in grain prices and a delayed U S  harvest have hampered farmers  purchases of fertilizer  But CF said it has a  positive  outlook on the current fourth quarter as farm economics remain attractive and North American natural gas costs have dropped from their 2014 highs 
An unplanned outage at its Woodward  Oklahoma  complex last month will reduce volumes of UAN  urea ammonium nitrate  and cut cash operating earnings by  20 million  CF said 
Last month  CF and rival Yara ended talks about a potential merger

What s Next for CF 
While CF has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

148484,370000,CF,CF Industries  CF  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when CF Industries  CF  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 12  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  61 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 06 billion  down 6 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 12  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF 
For CF  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  43 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CF would post earnings of  0 34 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 29  delivering a surprise of  14 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CF doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cf-industries-cf-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200504937,200504937

volumes fell 40  year over year to 720 000 tons  hurt by lower demand for fall ammonia applications due to cold and wet weather in the Midwestern United States as well as lower production volumes Average selling prices of ammonia rose roughly 22  year over year to  347 per ton  Higher energy costs across Europe and Asia coupled with reduced production due to the environmental restrictions in

forecast to rise by four million and one million acres  respectively  in the United States compared to 2018 Per the company  nitrogen prices globally declined through the end of 2018 and into 2019 after reaching their highs early in the fourth quarter  impacted by seasonally low demand in the Northern Hemisphere and moderating energy prices across Asia and Europe  However  CF Industries noted that industry fundamentals should be supportive of global nitrogen prices during first half 2019 as demand in the Northern Hemisphere starts to materialize The company said that China s role in globally traded urea continued to shrink in 2018  It expects Chinese urea export volumes to be in a similar range in 2019 due to tighter environmental restrictions and persisting firm energy prices Moreover  urea imports into India and Brazil was 6 3 million metric tons and 5 5 million metric tons  respectively  in 2018 and CF Industries sees total Indian and Brazilian urea import requirements to be in a similar range this year The company also expects its capital expenditures to be  400  450 million in 2019 Price PerformanceShares of CF Industries have lost 9 5  in the past six months

Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in

148552,370068,CF,CF Industries  CF  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CF Industries  CF  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  48 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 02 billion  up 6 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 85  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF 
For CF  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  40 30  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CF would post earnings of  0 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 21  delivering a surprise of  58 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CF doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cf-industries-cf-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200410389,200410389

148595,370111,CF,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  CF Industries  Nutrien And Mosaic,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 10  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  CF Industries Holdings  Inc    NYSE CF    Nutrien Ltd    NYSE NTR   and The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  Fertilizer Industry on Solid Footing  3 Stocks to BuyThe fertilizer industry has gained strength  courtesy of improving pricing and demand dynamics for major crop nutrients   Moreover  prices of primary crop nutrients are likely to gain momentum on the back of strong global demand and tightened supply  We believe that the time is right for the investors to add some fertilizer stocks that offer significant growth prospects Favorable Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks  industry currently carries a   49  which places it in the top 20  of more than 250 Zacks industries  The favorable rank reflects the industry s strength  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one Healthy Pricing   Demand FundamentalsGlobal nitrogen demand and supply balance is likely to continue to tighten  thereby providing a boost to nitrogen prices  CF Industries Holdings  Inc  expects global nitrogen supply to be lower than expected  while demand is likely to stay strong in the short  to midterm  Per the company  farmers are expected to plant 93 million acres of corn in the United States in 2019  around four million more acres than 2018 levels  This along with the expected increase in wheat plantings is likely to drive nitrogen demand in North America According to CF Industries  China s role in globally traded urea continues to shrink  Enforcement of environmental regulations along with higher feedstock costs are limiting export volumes from China  Expected demand for urea in Brazil and India is also expected to support a tighter global nitrogen demand and supply balance into 2019 Another major fertilizer maker  Nutrien Ltd   also expects a favorable demand environment along with limited new supply and relatively stable Chinese urea exports to support nitrogen prices   Also  global phosphate and potash market fundamentals are improving as well as demand growth is strong  The Mosaic Company sees continued growth in global demand for phosphates and expects record shipments in 2019  The company expects global phosphate demand growth to outpace supply additions in 2019  providing support to prices  Lower Chinese exports and slower than expected ramp up of new facilities have contributed to tighter phosphates supply  Tighter market conditions have also boosted potash prices A Few ConcernsWeak agricultural commodity prices are a roadblock in the near future  Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  are at multi year lows due to a supply glut  Trade tussle between the United States and China has weighed on crop prices in North America  Depressed U S  farm income is likely to have a negative impact on farmers  nutrient purchasing decisions   3 Fertilizer Stocks to ConsiderDespite a few persisting headwinds  the overall fundamentals of the fertilizer industry are improving on the back of healthy demand and pricing for major crop nutrients  Moreover  the constant need of farmers to nourish their crops  replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing world support the bullish case for fertilizers Below we highlight three fertilizer stocks  all carrying a

148598,370114,CF,CF Industries  CF  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"CF Industries  CF  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2550  
Revenues are expected to be  1 30 billion  up 18  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CF 
For CF  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  40 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CF will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CF would post earnings of  0 15 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 13  delivering a surprise of  13 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CF doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cf-industries-cf-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200384428,200384428

148799,370315,CF,Oil   Gas Drives Franco Nevada As Candelaria Grades Drop,opinion,On Nov 14  we issued an updated research report on Franco Nevada Corporation   TO FNV    Though lower grade at Candelaria mine will weigh on its gold production in 2018  the company is poised to deliver improved results driven by strong performance in its Oil   Gas portfolio  Lower Grade at Candelaria to Drag Down 2018 Production In November 2017  Lundin Mining announced an updated mine plan to address localized pit wall instability  While decreased grades were expected in 2018  the impact on gold and silver production was greater than anticipated  Consequently  Franco Nevada lowered Gold Equivalent Ounces   GEO   production to 440 000 470 000 GEOs from mining assets in 2018 from the earlier mining asset guidance of 460 000 490 000 GEOs  Even though production is expected to recover in 2019  the processing of lower grade material at Candelaria is anticipated to continue for the remainder of 2018  The lower guidance is disappointing as the company s top line will not benefit in case metal prices rise  Momentum in Oil   Gas Portfolio to Aid 2018 Results Performance from Oil   Gas portfolio remains robust with revenues doubling to  68 million in the first three quarters of 2018 from  33 million in the prior year period  This can be attributed to stronger oil prices and increased production from the newly added U S  assets  Drill activity is higher and drilling productivity is better than expected  Consequently  Franco Nevada now expects to generate  75  85 million in revenues from oil   gas for 2018  higher than the previous expectation of revenues of  65  75 million  Cobre Panama  A Catalyst Despite Near Term Uncertainty The company has so far invested  1 billion for the Cobre Panama project  Over the next two years  Cobre Panama will be ramping up to full production  Cobre Panama is expected to contribute 25  of the company s NAV and is a key catalyst  Until actual gold and silver starts coming in from the project  it is not clear how well the mine will produce  Strategic Relationship with Continental Resources  A Key Catalyst In October 2018  Franco Nevada contributed  214 8 million to close its previously announced transaction with Continental Resources  Inc  to acquire Oil   Gas mineral rights in the SCOOP and STACK plays of Oklahoma   two of the most economic and attractive plays in North America  It has also committed  subject to satisfaction of agreed upon development thresholds  to spend up to  300 million over the next three years to acquire additional mineral rights through a newly formed company  Acquisition of mineral rights is ongoing and Franco Nevada now anticipates funding additional capital contributions of between  35 million and  55 million in 2018 as part of its  300 million commitment  This represents a new business development opportunity for Franco Nevada  It gets an acquisition vehicle  which provides the ability to acquire assets at the grassroots level or directly from individual owners  This is a segment of the market previously inaccessible to Franco Nevada due to a lack of staff or resources to carry out these smaller scale acquisitions  More importantly  Franco Nevada benefits from the operator s drill plans  along with their knowledge of local land title and geology  Lower Metal Prices  A Near Term Concern The prices of precious metals  particularly gold are a determining factor for profitability for Franco Nevada  Gold prices have been affected by the trade tussle between the United States and China  interest rate hikes and a stronger dollar lately  Lower prices will weigh on Franco Nevada s performance in the near term   Shares of the company have lost 23  in the past year  compared with the  s decline of 22   Poised Well for the Long Term Franco Nevada strives to generate 80  of revenues from precious metals over long term horizon which includes gold  silver and PGM  With around 85  of revenues earned from precious metals year to date  the company has the flexibility to consider diversification opportunities outside of the precious metals  space and increase exposure to other commodities while maintaining its long term target  Further  Franco Nevada appears to be on a promising long term trajectory thanks to a healthy portfolio of streaming and royalty agreements put in place years ago  With more mines coming online in the next several years  it will benefit from higher levels of precious metals sales as well as higher prices  The company maintains solid growth outlook till 2022  forecasting production in the range of 565 000 595 000 GEOs  Furthermore  Franco Nevada s balance sheet remains debt free  Franco Nevada currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Stocks to Consider Some better ranked stocks in the basic materials space are CF Industries Holdings  Inc    NYSE CF    The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS   and KMG Chemicals  Inc    NYSE KMG    CF

148903,370419,CF,MOS Vs  CF  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Fertilizers stocks are likely familiar with Mosaic  MOS  and CF Industries  CF   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  both Mosaic and CF Industries are holding a Zacks Rank of   1  Strong Buy   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
MOS currently has a forward P E ratio of 18 53  while CF has a forward P E of 32 05  We also note that MOS has a PEG ratio of 2 65  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  CF currently has a PEG ratio of 5 34

CF shares have added about 8 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 3  
What s Next for CF 
While CF has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

149054,370570,CF,Fertilizer Industry Gaining Stability  3 Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"The fertilizer industry is showing signs of stability of late  taking succour from improved pricing and demand dynamics for certain major crop nutrients and a firming farm economy While still weak agricultural commodity prices remain a roadblock  strong usage in major consumer markets is driving demand for primary crop nutrients  Needless to say  the ever growing world population and the concomitant need to beef up food supply to feed more mouths remains a prime catalyst for fertilizer demand growth The  has outperformed the broader market over the past three months  While the industry has gained roughly 12 1   the S P 500 has returned around 6 3  

 
Let s do a quick health check of the fertilizer industry by delving deeper into certain key factors Potash Market Showing StrengthThe potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows  Potash prices have recovered this year after feeling gravity s pull in 2016  supported by improving demand and tighter supply conditions  Most producers of this major nutrient  including Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan Inc    NYSE POT   and Agrium Inc    NYSE AGU   witnessed a spike in prices in the third quarter that drove their potash margins Demand for potash also has been strong in key markets  Potash Corp   a major producer of the nutrient  saw healthy demand for potash in the third quarter and expects consistent customer engagement through the balance of 2017  supported by healthy consumption trends with contracts with both China and India in place  The company envisions 2017 to be a record year for potash demand and expects global demand in the band of 62 million to 65 million tons Potash Corp  sees strong consumption in China driven by a shift to more potassium intensive crops like vegetables and fruits  The demand environment also remains healthy in Brazil  another important market  driven by higher crop acreage and application rates  Strong affordability and the need to replenish nutrients are also expected to support fertilizer demand in North America Moreover  the government of India s move to cut the Goods and Services Tax  GST  rate on fertilizers from 12  to 5  is a welcome news for famers in that country  It also augurs well for potash demand in India  one of the world s top buyers of the nutrient According to Agrium  potash market is expected to remain tight through the rest of 2017  As such  higher demand from major consumers coupled with tight supply should further drive up potash prices A Rebound in NitrogenAnother positive is the recent rebound in the nitrogen space  The nitrogen market is seeing improving demand and pricing fundamentals  According to CF Industries Holdings  Inc    NYSE CF    a major producer  the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from second quarter  which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports and strong global demand  especially in India and Brazil   The company expects consistent global nitrogen demand growth moving ahead Moreover  Agrium  in its third quarter call  said that nitrogen prices have witnessed sharp increase  of more than 50   since the lows seen in July  buoyed by low level of Chinese urea production and solid import demand from India  Higher domestic coal prices coupled with increased focus on reducing pollution has led to a reduction in Chinese urea production 
Agrium also sees positive supply demand fundamentals for nitrogen in the medium term  Continued strong demand and tighter market conditions augur well for nitrogen prices in the fourth quarter Phosphate Market a Mixed BagExcess capacity continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed in the first three quarters of 2017  Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through this year  with new capacity reportedly coming from Morocco and Saudi Arabia   thereby putting pressure on prices However  demand environment for the nutrient remains favorable  The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS    one of the biggest producers of phosphate  noted in its September quarter earnings call that demand remains strong as farmers are looking to replace nutrients from the soil in most of the major regions globally  The company also envisions demand growth to absorb new supply additions A Stabilizing Farm EconomyU S  farm income is expected to tick up this year after three straight years of decline due to low commodity prices  Per the U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  recently released November 2017 forecast  net U S  farm income is expected to go up 2 7  to  63 2 billion in 2017 The upturn in profits is likely be driven by higher cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories  The USDA expects cash receipts to go up 2 4  to  365 1 billion in 2017 While the USDA s profit forecast for this year is still a far cry from the record  123 8 billion achieved in 2013  it gives signs of stability in the farm economy and suggests that the sector may have finally hit the bottom  Higher anticipated farm income is expected to positively influence farmers  nutrient purchasing decisions Crop Pricing Remains a ConcernThe prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies  Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows as markets remain awash with grains  An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017  The USDA s harvest outlook indicates another bumper year of production  The USDA  in its November report  raised its corn harvest forecast for the 2017 18 crop year  It now sees corn production to be 14 578 billion bushels  up 298 million from its October forecast  on record yield  The USDA also predicts record soybean production of 4 425 billion bushels  This is expected to aggravate the grain glut and restrict crop prices 3 Fertilizer Stocks to Bear FruitDespite a few lingering headwinds  the overall fundamentals for the fertilizer industry are improving on the back of improved demand scenario for nutrients and an upswing in the farm economy  Moreover  the constant need of farmers to nourish their crops  replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing world support the bullish case for fertilizers Below we highlight three fertilizer stocks  armed with a solid Zacks Rank  that are worth considering for investment in the prevailing operating environment The Mosaic CompanyHeadquartered in Plymouth  MN  Mosaic is a solid choice armed with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see The company has an expected earnings growth of 14 4  for 2017  It also has a long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 9 5  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017

gain of 11  over the same period Annual estimates for Sociedad Quimica have also moved north over the past 30 days  reflecting analysts  confidence in the stock  Over this period  the Zacks Consensus

	Global surpluses in your core competency dampens growth levels  and puts pressure on a company s pricing power as well  This is the situation facing our Zacks Bear of the Day  CF Industries  NYSE        who is dealing with global nitrogen supply surpluses due high stockpiles of the commodity in China  India  and Pakistan  Further  this supply glut is not expected to be reduced as a wetter and colder than expected spring has delayed ammonia applications in the Midwest United States

149079,370595,CF,Is It Time To Buy Agriculture Stocks ,opinion," 0     Agriculture Stocks  Ignored By Investors 2     Equipment Manufactures 8     Fertilizer Market 15     Nitrogen Producers 20     Episode Roundup  Welcome to Episode  88 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast 
Every week  host and Zacks stock strategist  Tracey Ryniec  will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks  bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life 
But in this episode  due to the upcoming holiday  she s going solo to talk about one of her favorite investing industries  the agriculture stocks 
This is a cyclical industry  It does well when commodity prices are high and the farmers are getting rich  and then it falls when the reverse happens  A few years ago  the farmers were being compared to bankers in terms of wealth  But since then  as commodity prices have dropped  there has been a 3 year farming recession 
Sales of farming equipment have fallen every year during that time  And on the fertilizer side  overproduction has kept prices low even though demand has remained stable 
A Rebound in 2017 
2016 was a difficult year for the farming industry  But in their first quarter earnings reports  many companies began to talk about the market in a new  more optimistic light 
While 2017 is still expected to see low fertilizer prices  they believe the worst is likely over and that there will be improvement into 2018 
If that s true  is now a buying opportunity in the stocks 
Wall Street is completely ignoring this industry  As a result  several of them are trading near multi year lows 
Two Different Segments  Equipment versus Fertilizers
Tracey looks at two different areas of agriculture  the equipment makers and the fertilizer producers  which have split personalities 
On the equipment side  Deere and AGCOare seeing rising earnings estimates  Both stocks are Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  
1        Deere  DE  recently got a boost thanks to its announced acquisition of Wirtgen Group  which will complement the company s Construction   Forestry unit  It will be in the Top 5 of road construction equipment makers after the deal closes 
2        AGCO  AGCO  is seeing a bottoming in demand after 3 years of declines  Brazil is expected to finally rebound this year 
Both of these stocks are up in 2017 with Deere up 20  and AGCO up 16 6  year to date 
Is it too late to get in 
The Fertilizer Stocks  A Buying Opportunity or Not 
Tracey also took a look at the fertilizer stocks  which have been completely battered in this downturn 
1        Agrium  AGU  is merging with Potash this year to form Nutrien  It will be the largest fertilizer company in the world  Is Tracey a fan of this merger 
2        Mosaic  MOS  shares are down 20  year to date and near 5 year lows  But are there reasons to be optimistic about the second half of 2017 for this potash and phosphate producer 
3        CF Industries  CF  is the nitrogen fertilizer maker  Non North American producers dumped excess supply onto the North American market earlier this year which depressed prices in the first quarter  However  demand from American farmers has been strong  Shares are down 11   It s a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  but if those estimates turn around  could this be one to buy 
She used to own Potash in her own personal portfolio but recently threw in the towel and sold her shares  It is probably a sign that this industry could be on the upswing since Tracey used to be a diehard bull on the fertilizer stocks 
Usually the bottom is in when even the diehards give up

however  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 031 million  Sales declined in the quarter as volumes were offset by lower average selling prices in most segments The company said that strong second quarter performance reflects high utilization rates  record sales volume and cost efficiencies CF Industries Holdings  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Segment ReviewSales for the Ammonia segment rose roughly 8 7  year over year to  389 million in the reported quarter  Ammonia sales volumes rose 33  year over year to 1 2 million tons owing to additional production volumes from the new capacity expansions at Donaldsonville and Port Neal complexes  Average selling prices declined 17 8  year over year to  338 per ton due to excess global nitrogen supply Sales for the Granular Urea segment rose roughly 7 9  year over year to  259 million  Sales volumes increased roughly 53  year over year to 1 221 000 tons  driven by additional volume available from the new urea capacity at the Port Neal nitrogen complex  Average selling prices for granular urea declined 14 2  year over year to  212 per ton owing to elevated global nitrogen supply Sales at the UAN  urea ammonium nitrate solution  segment fell 22 7  year over year to  286 million  UAN sales volume fell roughly 11  year over year to 1 631 000 in the quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions in North America which

balance of 2017 and also in 2018  as the global markets continue to adapt to considerable capacity increase in the recent years   According to CF Industries  the North American market is likely to remain import dependent in the foreseeable future  UAN and urea imports through May were down 10  and 22  respectively  However  many shipments arriving after April did not enter distribution channel because of higher imports during the first quarter  which resulted in significant urea price declines  The company also noted that North America is entering into a period of seasonally lowest demand and prices  and substantial imports could pressure selling prices in the third quarter   CF Industries expect 6 2 million metric tons of nameplate urea capacity to start up in 2017 and 2018  and the global supply is expected to slow in the longer term For 2017  the company expects new capital expenditures of around  400 million Price PerformanceShares of CF Industries have moved up 6 1  in the

The segment gross margin is estimated to be in the low  20 per ton range  Mosaic  last month  issued an update on its third quarter business performance post Hurricane Irma  The company witnessed good demand and strong operational performance prior to the hurricane with profitability metrics tracking ahead of the third quarter guidance  Post the mayhem of Irma  Mosaic now expects roughly 250 000 to 350 000 tons of lower production in September  In addition to this  the damage to Mosaic s Bartow warehouse is anticipated to result in a loss of up to 400 000 tons of finished phosphate product  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the Phosphate segment is is pegged at  878 million for the third quarter  reflecting an estimated 9 9  decline from the second quarter  Segment sales volume is also expected to decline 7 7  sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2 4 million tons for the third quarter   Potash segment s net sales are expected to fall 5 3  sequentially in

quarter is pegged at  850 million  Segment sales volume is also expected to jump around 50  sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is roughly 2 4 million tons for the third quarter  Mosaic is expected to benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity  The company is also anticipated to gain from improving global demand for fertilizers and cost reduction measures   However  the

roughly 14 7  gain recorded by the industry   Earnings Whispers Our proven model shows that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Mosaic is currently  2 69   This is because the Most

carries a Zacks Rank  3 which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an

149093,370609,CF,U S  Steel  X  Warms Up To Q3  Another Earnings Beat Coming ,opinion,United States Steel Corporation   NYSE X   is set to release its third quarter 2017 results after the bell on Oct 31 The steel giant recorded a profit of  261 million or  1 48 per share in second quarter 2017  helped by strong results in its Flat Rolled unit  Adjusted earnings came in at  1 07 per share for the quarter that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents Revenues rose roughly 22  year over year to  3 144 million in the quarter  also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 975 million U S  Steel beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  while missing in the other two with an average positive surprise of 584 1  U S  Steel has outperformed the  it belongs to over a year  The company s shares have gained around 43 4  over this period  compared with roughly 32 1  gain recorded by the industry  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that U S  Steel is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for U S  Steel is  2 41  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 69 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 67 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  U S  Steel carries a Zacks Rank  3 which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Factors at PlayU S  Steel provided an optimistic view for 2017 in July  The company now expects net earnings of around  300 million or  1 70 per share for 2017  up from  260 million or  1 50 per share it expected earlier  The company is seeing positive sentiment in the markets served by Flat Rolled and U S  Steel Europe  USSE  units  Its Tubular unit is also gaining from operational and cost improvements and strong market conditions   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for U S  Steel for the to be reported quarter stands at  3 042 million  reflecting an expected increase of 13 3  from the year ago quarter Net sales for U S  Steel s Flat Rolled segment is projected to witness a 5 4  year over year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at  2 094 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the USSE unit is pegged at  662 million  reflecting a 14 9  year over year rise  Moreover  the company s Tubular segment s net sales are expected to increase by two and a half fold year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  283 million With respect to pricing  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized price for the Flat Rolled unit for the third quarter is pegged at  735 per net ton  representing an expected 2 4  year over year increase  But this reflects an expected 0 9  decline from the sequentially prior quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized price for the USSE unit stands at  586 per net ton  representing an expected 16 5  year over year rise  However  this reflects an expected 5 4  decline from the second quarter Average realized price for the Tubular segment is expected to increase 22 8  year over year and 4 4  sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  1 288 per net ton U S  Steel is expected to gain from healthy automotive demand  Also  U S  Steel is aggressively pursuing actions to improve its cost structure through its  Carnegie Way  program that may lend some support to its third quarter results  The company sees incremental impact from Carnegie Way benefits of  390 million for full year 2017 as compared with 2016 While U S  Steel s Flat Rolled division posted healthy results in the second quarter  the company is still facing certain operational issues in this unit  Increased outage and plant maintenance costs are affecting this division U S  Steel is implementing an asset revitalization plan aimed at improving its profitability and competitiveness  The plan is expected to take three four years for its full implementation  The company sees higher plant related spending as it accelerates asset revitalization investments and efforts  It sees maintenance and outage expenses  including those related to asset revitalization  of around  1 3 billion for the Flat Rolled unit for 2017  higher than  950 million in 2016 The U S  steel industry also remains hamstrung by high levels of steel imports  The American market continues to be inundated with cheap steel imports from overseas producers despite a raft of punitive trade actions  A surge in steel imports put downward pressure on U S  steel prices during the third quarter  Continued import pressure has not allowed steel pricing to keep pace with higher raw material costs during the third quarter Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Westlake Chemical Corporation   NYSE WLK

   Factors to ConsiderWestlake Chemical s acquisition of Axiall is expected to provide annual cost synergies of roughly  100 million and be accretive to its earnings from the first year  as the company is hopeful that the buyout will improve the financial as well as operational flexibility of the combined company and contribute to the current growth strategy  The company is making considerable progress in integrating both businesses towards achieving anticipated synergies According to the President and CEO  Albert Chao  the company should benefit from strong demand and rising prices for Vinyls and Olefins products  Westlake Chemical is also well positioned to benefit from improving commodity prices along with continued recovery of crude oil prices Westlake Chemical s shares rallied 22 4  in the last six months  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s gain of 5 9  
 
The Olefins segment registered income of  149 5 million in the last quarter  an increase of 7 8  year over year  The segment benefitted from record production of ethylene which partly offset the impact of low margins of integrated olefin products However  the Vinyls segment reported income of  37 6 million in fourth quarter 2016  a decrease of 27 1  year over year  The sales of this segment decreased due to lower production and sales volume  higher cost of selling Axiall inventory at fair value  unabsorbed fixed cost associated with manufacturing and planned turnaround at Lake Charles vinyls operations Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter The CF Industries Holdings  Inc    NYSE CF   has an Earnings ESP of  55 56  and sports a Zacks Rank  3 Franco Nevada Corp    TO FNV   has an Earnings ESP of  10 00  and carries a Zacks Rank  3 Ryerson Holding Corp    NYSE RYI   has an Earnings ESP of  2 86  and carries a Zacks Rank  3 Zacks  Hidden Trades

Stocks You Still Need to Shun in the Fertilizer Industry

The fertilizer industry is still stuck in a rut and remains buffeted by a slew of headwinds including low prices of nutrients and depressed farm income  These factors continue to weigh on the performance of the companies in the space as witnessed in the first half of 2016 

While long term fundamental for the fertilizer industry remains intact given the continued growth of global population and concurrent rise in food consumption  a number of challenges continue to hamstring the industry  The near term outlook for the fertilizer space still remains smoggy due continued pricing pressure  still weak agriculture market fundamentals and weakness across certain key consumer markets 
	Let s take a look at some of the key issues that are still hurting the stocks in this space Headwinds from Weak Nutrient Prices
	Fertilizer companies remain exposed to a difficult pricing environment  Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on fertilizer prices 
	Prices for potash  a major nutrient   which are already at their lowest levels since 2007  continue to be hurt by elevated supply  Prices of the commodity are down roughly 25  from one year ago 
	Potash prices came under pressure following the exit of the world s largest potash maker  Uralkali Group from one of the biggest potash cartels   the Belarus Potash Company   BPC     in 2013  In addition to creating an uncertain pricing environment  the cartel dissolution also led to increased competition in the potash market 
	The potash market is expected to remain oversupplied in the near future  thereby weighing on prices  Moreover  both China and India   two major potash consumers   have recently signed their potash contracts for 2016 at prices   219 per ton and  227 per ton  respectively  that are roughly 30  lower than last year  These weak contract price levels further suggest that pricing pressure may not alleviate any time soon 
	Moreover  depressed global energy prices and higher supply have contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment  Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected affect global prices in the second half of 2016  Urea prices are expected to remain under pressure in the near term  partly due to high levels of Chinese export supplies 
	Weak nutrient prices dragged down profits of major fertilizer makers in the second quarter of 2016 and are expected to remain a major headwind in the near to medium term  As such  margins of these producers will remain squeezed given a weak fertilizer pricing environment 

Depressed Farm Income  A Drag on Buying Decision
	Agriculture market fundamentals remain weak and there is a continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   U S  farm income is expected to slip 3  to  54 8 billion in 2016 to the lowest level since 2002  This would also mark the third consecutive year of decline  Lower farm income unfavorably impacts grower s nutrient purchasing decisions 
	The USDA outlook reflects depressed prices resulting from excess supply of crops and livestock  While prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  have recovered of late  they remain at their multi year lows 

The prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing is a concern for fertilizer companies as it is hindering fertilizer use by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers  income Weakness in Major Consumer Markets
	Insipid economic growth in certain key markets is also affecting the fertilizer industry  The crop protection market remains under pressure  in part  due to a slowdown in Brazil  Agricultural market conditions remain weak in Brazil impacted by cautious buying by farmers and the uncertain political and economic situation in that country  Tighter profit margins and credit are making growers in Brazil more cautious in their spending 
	Moreover  economic slowdown in China is also affecting demand for potash in this major market  Weaker demand in India and cautious buying in Brazil have also contributed to a depressed market environment for phosphate  A challenging currency environment coupled with economic weakness has also contributed to a sluggish demand environment for nutrients across certain emerging markets 5 Stocks to Avoid Now
	Amid the prevailing challenging scenario  it would be a prudent move to get rid of certain companies in the fertilizer space that show weak fundamentals  For that  we have screened sell rated fertilizer stocks that have either witnessed downward estimate revisions over the past few weeks or are expected to see a decline in earnings for the current year Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc

149130,370646,CF,Tyson Foods  CF Industries Holdings  Xerox  Macy s And Steelcase Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   September 29  2016    highlights Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   Inc   NYSE       as the Bull of the Day and CF Industries Holdings Inc  NYSE CF    NYSE      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on the Xerox  NYSE XRX  Corporation  NYSE     Macy s Inc  NYSE     and Steelcase Inc  NYSE      

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

Tyson Foods  Inc   NYSE      is generating stable earnings and sales growth as its core food brands continue to provide stability  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to have record earnings this year 

Tyson Foods is one of the leading food companies producing chicken  beef and pork  But it was its recent acquisition of food giant Hillshire Brands in 2014 that propelled the company into another category and provided earnings stability versus the up and down volatility of poultry and meat prices 

Its brands now include Tyson  Jimmy Dean  Sara Lee  Ball Park  Wright  Aidells  State Fair and Hillshire Farm  Its prepared foods include bacon  breakfast sausages  turkey  lunchmeat  hot dogs  pizza crusts  tortillas and desserts 

It has 400 facilities in the United States and around the world 

Another Big Beat in the Fiscal Third Quarter

On August 8  Tyson reported its fiscal 2016 third quarter results and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  0 14 

Earnings were  1 21 versus the consensus of  1 07 

All operating segment results were in or above their normalized operating margin ranges with the Chicken segment being especially strong  seeing a record 13 9  return on sales 

Raised Full Year Guidance

On the back of strong momentum  Tyson raised full year earnings guidance to  4 40 to  4 50 a share  which is 40  higher than a year ago 

It expects record earnings this fiscal year 

As a result  the analyst also raised their estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to  4 52 from  4 35 over the last 60 days  which is slightly higher than the company s guidance 

The analysts are also bullish on fiscal 2017 as the Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to  4 82 from  4 47 over the last 2 months 

That is earnings growth of 6 8   Tyson believes it can get earnings growth up to the high single digits in fiscal 2017 

Additionally  on Sep 8  at the Consumer Staples Conference  Tyson confirmed its bullish stance 

  

CF Industries Holdings Inc   NYSE      is expected to see sharply lower earnings in 2016 as the fertilizer market remains weak  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is forecast to see earnings drop by almost half this year 

CF Industries is one of the largest manufacturers of nitrogen products in the world  It operates nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the US  Canada and the United Kingdom with customers throughout the world 

It also owns a 50  interest in an ammonia facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 

A Tough 2016

On Aug 3  CF reported second quarter results and  for the fourth quarter in a row  it missed on the Zacks Consensus Estimate as the fertilizer market remained weak 

They haven t been small misses either 

The second quarter miss was by  0 35  It reported just  0 33 but the analysts were expecting  0 68 

Fertilizer prices in North America continue to be pressured  Wet and cool weather delayed fertilizer applications in the second quarter and a high level of imported products in April and May pressured prices 

Net sales declined to  1 13 billion from  1 3 billion in the second quarter of 2015 due to lower selling prices across all segments 

There continues to be a worldwide oversupply of nitrogen products which is impacting prices 

Estimates Slashed Again

Given the big miss and the weak outlook in the industry  the analysts have been cutting both 2016 and 2017 estimates 

The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to  1 18 from  1 32 in the past 30 days 

That is down from  2 00 just 90 days ago 

CF Industries made  3 88 in 2015 so that s an earnings decline of 69 5  

2017 isn t looking much better  although the analysts do see a floor in the earnings drop 

They ve been cutting 2017 estimates as well  The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now down to  1 29 from  2 27 just 3 months ago 

That s an earnings increase of 9   but it s not much to cheer about given the huge cut in earnings in 2016  It does  however  indicate that the analysts expect some stabilization in fertilizer prices in 2017

149137,370653,CF,Domino s Pizza  CF Industries Holdings  Electronic Arts  Tencent Holdings And Activision Blizzard Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   November 04  2016    highlights Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE       as the Bull of the Day and CF Industries Holdings  NYSE CF   Inc   NYSE      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Electronic Arts  NASDAQ EA   NASDAQ     isTencent Holdings  OTCMKTS    and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   NASDAQ     

	Here is a synopsis of all the five stocks 

  

Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE     is proving that not all is doom and gloom with the consumer  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is crushing the competition as pizza and the ease of its app for ordering remain popular 

	Domino s Pizza is one of the world s largest pizza restaurant chains with 13 200 stores in over 80 markets  Independent franchise owners accounted for over 97  of Domino s stores 

	By the end of 2015  its digital sales reached  4 7 billion annually thanks to its clever apps and ordering through text messaging using a pizza emoji 

	In late 2015  it also launched its first digital customer loyalty program called Piece of the Pie Rewards 

Domino s Crushed it in the Third Quarter

	On Oct 18  Domino s reported its third quarter earnings and easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  0 06 

	Earnings were  0 96 versus the consensus of  0 90 

	But even more amazing was the continued growth of its comparable store sales  Domestic same store sales rose 13   the 22nd straight quarter of growth  while international same store sales grew 6 6  

	It is one of the few restaurant chains that is growing US sales in the double digits right now 

	How s it doing it 

	Its mobile app is driving sales  along with its new loyalty program  The pizza industry is very diluted  No one chain has ever dominated the market because there are so many mom and pop restaurants  That gives Domino s an opportunity to continue to grow by taking sales away from the mom and pops and even bake at home or frozen pizza 

	Internationally  Domino s is often the only game in town and in some areas it s a well known  trusted brand  If you re vacationing in Cancun and get the pizza urge  who are you going to order from  And the app is right there on your phone 

	Domino s opened up 316 new stores in the third quarter as growth is still out there  It recently opened its 1 000th store in India  which is its largest international market  But it also opened its first store in the epicenter of Pizza  in Italy 

	Nothing is off limits 

Analysts Love What They See

	The story is still really bullish for Domino s  8 estimates were raised for 2016 after the earnings report which has pushed the 2016 Zacks Consensus up to  4 24 from  4 13 just 30 days ago 

	That is earnings growth of 23  

	2017 is looking equally hot  6 estimates have been revised higher in the last 30 days pushing the Zacks Consensus higher to  5 11 from  4 93  That s another 21  earnings growth 

 

CF Industries Holdings  Inc   NYSE     recently posted its first quarterly loss in 6 years  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is still getting hit by declining fertilizer prices 

	CF Industries is one of the largest producers of nitrogen fertilizer products in the world  It has manufacturing facilities in the US  Canada and the United Kingdom  It also owns a 50  interest in an ammonia facility in the The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 

Earnings Plunge Year Over Year

	On Nov 2  CF Industries reported its third quarter results and beat on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents  Adjusted earnings were  0 13 compared to the Zacks Consensus of  0 05 

	The company made  0 54 in the year ago quarter 

	Net sales fell 27  to  680 million from  928 million a year ago  The company got hit by lower nitrogen prices  The average selling price for CF products in the quarter was  185 per ton compared to  289 per ton for the same quarter a year ago  That s a decline of 36  

	It s no surprise  then  that the company s earnings estimates are in a steep decline 

Estimates Still Being Cut

	The earnings estimates haven t yet bottomed in the fertilizer industry 

	CF Industries made  3 88 last year  The 2016 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to  0 97 and may be cut further  That s an earnings decline of 75  

	Right now  the analysts are hoping that this is the worst of it  The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate shows a small rebound to  1 12  But will that even hold 

	CF Industries said that the third quarter prices were impacted by the  continuing global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and the overall lower industrial demand   It said that customers were unwilling to take inventory risks in the third quarter and implied in its outlook that the beginning of 2017 still looked tough 

The Balance Sheet

	It wouldn t be unusual for investors to start to wonder about the company s balance sheet with these horrible industry conditions 

	But as of Sep 30  2016  CF Industries still had cash and cash equivalents of  1 55 billion and had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility  It was also in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments

E sports Are the Next Billion Dollar Industry  3 Stocks to Watch

	Video games have been a staple of consumer entertainment since their earliest days  and people have always been obsessed with playing the latest games and systems  However  the advent of smartphones pushed many away from traditional gaming platforms until the latest trend  e sports  brought people back in a hurry 

What Are E sports 

	E sports are defined as any form of competition facilitated by electronic systems  and that typically refers to competitive video game playing  While most gamers play their favorite games as a form of leisure  professional gamers enter international tournaments  rack up sponsorships  and compete for multi million dollar prize pools 

	Competitive gaming at a professional level is a relatively new concept  but it s already compiling a rabid fan base that looks very similar to those of regular sports  For the average gamer  e sports offer a variety of new ways to interact with their favorite games  and following specific leagues and players passionately is becoming a regular thing 

Money to Make

	Of course  when there s this level of interest in something  there s also going to be money to be made  Between the companies that develop the games and leagues  the corporate sponsors that use e sports as a marketing tool  and the millions of viewers watching ad supported livestreams of events  e sports is becoming a cash heavy business 

	According to research from   worldwide e sports related revenue was already up to  325 million in 2015  and this year s expected total was  463 million  which would represent year over year growth of 43   The same research suggests that the e sports business could cross the  1 billion threshold by 2019  when total revenue is expected to be  1 1 billion 

Stocks to Watch

	With all this in mind  our investor brains will remind us that we need to look out for the companies that stand to benefit the most from the e sports boom

Revenues for the quarter slumped 41 8  year over year to  935 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 137 million 
Segment Review
Potash  Potash gross margin was  123 million in the reported quarter  down from  417 million in the year ago quarter due to considerably lower prices and offshore sales volumes  Sales volumes for the segment were 2 1 million tons  down 16  year over year  Average realized potash price was  154 per ton  down from  273 per ton in the year ago quarter 
Nitrogen  Sales volumes for the quarter were 1 5 million tons  down 8  from the year ago quarter due to weaker North American industrial demand  Second quarter gross margin was  130 million  41  lower than the year ago quarter  Average realized price for nitrogen products fell to  244 per ton from  334 per ton a year ago  owing to weaker benchmark pricing 
Phosphate  Sales volumes were 0 5 million  down 25  mainly due to weaker North American demand  Gross margin was a negative  10 million  adversely affected by lower phosphate prices  charges of  29 million related to inventory write downs and an unfavorable discount rate adjustment to asset retirement obligations
Average realized phosphate price for the quarter was  485 per ton  down from  553 per ton in the prior year quarter as lower demand weighed on prices 
FinancialsPotash Corp  s cash and cash equivalents were  143 million as of Jun 30  2016 compared with  449 million as of Jun 30  2015  Long term debt was  3 713 million as of Jun 30  2016 compared with  3 710 million as of Jun 30  2015 
Guidance Potash Corp    which is among the top players in the fertilizer industry along with Agrium   NYSE AGU    Mosaic   NYSE MOS   and CF Industries   NYSE CF     reiterated its 2016 potash sales volumes guidance in the range of 8 3 8 8 million tons  though lower prices earlier in the year are expected to weigh on the results for the balance of 2016  The company now projects potash gross margin to be in the  400  600 million range 
Potash Corp  forecasts a weaker price environment to hurt its nitrogen and phosphate segments through the remaining part of 2016  It has lowered the combined nitrogen and phosphate gross margin outlook for the year to the  400  550 million range 
Lower earnings have brought down the company s expected provincial mining and other taxes for 2016  now projected in the range of 23  26  of potash gross margin  excluding  32 million of New Brunswick severance costs   The effective income tax rate is anticipated to be in a range of 16  18  given lower earnings and a greater proportion of income from lower tax jurisdictions 
As a result of these changes  the company lowered its 2016 earnings guidance to 40 55 cents per share  including notable charges through the first half of 11 cents per share  For the third quarter  the company expects earnings to be in the range of 5 10 cents per share 
The company also plans to reduce its quarterly dividend from 25 cents per share to10 cents per share commencing with the declaration of its next dividend in September

149171,370687,CF,Falling Earnings Estimates Signal Weakness Ahead For CF Industries  CF  ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is CF Industries Holdings  Inc    NYSE CF    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  further confirms weakness in CF A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from  2 77 a share a month ago to its current level of  2 26 Also  for the current quarter  CF Industries has seen 4 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 76 cents a share from 96 cents over the past 30 days    The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 19 3  in the past month So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Basic Materials sector  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Commercial Metals Company   NYSE CMC    The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and may be better selection at this time Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ,2016-06-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/falling-earnings-estimates-signal-weakness-ahead-for-cf-industries-(cf)-200133400,200133400
149174,370690,CF,Fertilizer Industry  Bottomed Or More Pain Ahead  ,opinion,Analysts at UBS  in a recent report  said that they believe fertilizer markets are bottoming on the back of improved agriculture market fundamentals and the recent  run up  in crop prices The firm s view is based on the data provided by Agrium   NYSE AGU     one of the major fertilizer makers   at the company s investor day last week  UBS noted that Agrium s data could be seen as a proxy for the state of the broader fertilizer industry given that the company is a top player in nitrogen  phosphate and potash markets  The firm added that improved crop prices could augur well for growers  income and willingness to spend on nutrients moving forward While UBS s view paints an optimistic picture  the question is whether the industry will rebound or there will be further pain ahead  Let s dig into some of the key issues that are still weighing on the stocks in the fertilizer space Supply Glut Hurting Nutrient PricesFertilizer makers remain exposed to a difficult pricing environment for nutrients they sale  Potash prices  which are already at their lowest levels since 2007  remain under pressure due to elevated supply  The potash market is expected to remain oversupplied in the near future  thereby hurting prices  Moreover  depressed global energy prices and higher supply have also contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  Urea prices are expected to remain under pressure in the near term  partly due to high levels of Chinese export supplies   Weak nutrient prices dragged down profits of major fertilizer makers such as Potash Corp    NYSE POT    Agrium  Mosaic   NYSE MOS    CF Industries   NYSE CF   and CVR Partners   NYSE UAN   in the first quarter of 2016 and are expected to remain a major headwind in the near to medium term   As such  margins of these producers will remain squeezed given a weak fertilizer pricing environment Low Farm Income  A Drag on Buying Decision  The agriculture market is not out of the woods yet and there is a continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  According to the U S  Department of Agriculture   USDA    U S  farm income is expected to slip 3  to  54 8 billion in 2016 to the lowest level since 2002  This would also mark the third straight year of decline The outlook reflects depressed prices resulting from excess supply of crops and livestock  While prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  have recovered of late  they remain at their multi year lows  CHS Inc   the nation s largest farmer owned cooperative  also said earlier this year that net farm income is falling faster than cash receipts and the U S  farm economy is not at the bottom yet  Lower farm income unfavorably impacts grower s nutrient purchasing decisions  Uncertainty in Key Consumer MarketsThe general outlook for the fertilizer industry remains cloudy due to insipid economic growth in certain developing markets  A challenging currency environment coupled with economic weakness has contributed to a sluggish demand environment for potash across certain emerging markets Moreover  the crop protection market remains under pressure  in part  due to a slowdown in Brazil  Agricultural market conditions remain weak in Brazil impacted by cautious buying by farmers and the uncertain political and economic situation in that country  Tighter profit margins and credit are making growers in Brazil more cautious in their spending  Lower insect pressure and reduced seed volumes are also contributing to a weakening demand for crop protection products China  the world s biggest potash importer  is also yet to sign potash supply agreements for 2016  leading to uncertainty in the global potash market and downward pressure on potash prices  This has also led to cautious buying patterns in other major consumer markets including India Moreover  lower government subsidies coupled with local currency devaluation may lead to depressed demand for potash from farmers in India which has been in the grip of severe drought this year  Drought conditions will hurt demand in India which in turn would put pressure on prices  High inventory levels in India and cautious buying in Brazil have also contributed to a depressed market environment for phosphate End NoteBased on the above mentioned factors  it could be surmised that the broader fertilizer industry is still in a rut and remains buffeted by a slew of headwinds that could continue to weigh on the performance of the companies in the space moving ahead  Nevertheless  long term fundamental for the fertilizer industry remains intact given the continued growth of global population and concurrent rise in food consumption ,2016-06-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fertilizer-industry:-bottomed-or-more-pain-ahead-200136225,200136225

Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is pressurizing prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  Moreover  the devaluation of the Chinese currency and reduced coal prices have contributed to a decline in urea prices    Lower prices for nitrogen fertilizer weighed on CF Industries  bottom line in the last reported quarter and are expected to remain a headwind in the March quarter  Abundant global supply contributed to lower pricing across the company s ammonia  granular urea and UAN units in fourth quarter 2015  leading to double digit declines in sales in these businesses  Revenue weakness across these businesses may continue to put pressure on the company s top line in the first quarter  thereby affecting its profits Nevertheless  CF Industries remains on track with its capacity expansion projects in Louisiana and Iowa  Both projects will expand the company s production capacity by 1 7 million tons or 25   CF Industries plans to spend roughly  1 2 billion in 2016 on capacity expansion projects The company  in Mar 2016  announced the start up of its new UAN plant at its Nitrogen Complex in Donaldsonville  LA  The plant  which became operational in early March  has achieved consistent  stable operation and produced more than 80 000 tons of UAN since start up  The start up of the UAN plant is part of the company s major capacity expansion projects in North America  It is the second new plant to be commissioned and also the biggest operating single train UAN plant globally The proposed acquisition of the specific assets of Netherlands based fertilizers producer   OCI N V    also represents a significant move by CF Industries  The merger will create a global nitrogen behemoth and is expected to boost CF Industries  production capacity by 65   It will also extend the company s portfolio into the rapidly growing methanol market CF Industries expects to achieve around  500 million  post tax  in annual run rate synergies from the transaction  expected to close in mid 2016  through optimization of operations  capital and corporate structure  The company also expects to achieve meaningful cost reduction and operational efficiencies by leveraging the most extensive distribution network in North America Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CF Industries is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for CF Industries is  11 77   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is 45 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents Zacks Rank  CF Industries  Zacks Rank  3  Hold  increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter The Scotts Miracle Gro Company   NYSE SMG   has an Earnings ESP of  1 12  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Orion Engineered Carbons SA   NYSE OEC   has an Earnings ESP of  13 79  and a Zacks Rank  3  Albemarle Corporation   NYSE ALB   has an Earnings ESP of  1 18  and a Zacks Rank  3 ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cf-industries-(cf):-will-weak-prices-dent-earnings-again-200127374,200127374

Fertilizer Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 4

The first quarter earnings season has crossed the midway point with more and more companies coming out with positive earnings surprises  taking succor from lower estimates and a weakening greenback 

Per our latest   out of the 310 S P 500 members that have reported as of last Friday  71 9  of them have beaten earnings estimates with 57 1  beating on the revenue front  However  total earnings for these companies are down 7 2  year over year on a 2 4  decline in sales  First quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are now expected to dip 7 3  year over year on 1 1  lower revenues with the Energy sector being a major drag 
	A few fertilizer companies are among a bunch of S P 500 stocks that are lined up to report their quarterly numbers this week  The fertilizer industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector which is among the sectors that have seen double digit earnings declines in the first quarter based on the earnings scorecard as of Apr 29  Earnings for the sector participants in the S P 500 index are down 13  from the same period last year on 9  lower revenues 
	The Basic Materials sector is also among 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors that are expected to see negative earnings growth in the first quarter with an expected earnings decline of 15 8  on 8 5  lower sales  Nevertheless  the sector is witnessing improved blended beat which is the proportion of companies that beat both revenues and earnings estimates  Blended beat for the sector for the first quarter is 42 9   which compares favorably to 4 quarter average of 8 9  
	The general outlook for the fertilizer industry remains cloudy due to insipid economic growth in certain developing markets  Fertilizer makers continue to face challenges from low farm commodity prices  affecting their margins  Weakness in agricultural commodity prices represents a concern for these companies which is hindering fertilizer use by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on grower s incomes 
	Continued downturn in prices of crops  such as corn and soybeans  is weighing on U S  farm income  Lower farm income unfavorably impacts grower s purchasing decisions 
	Moreover  global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is pressurizing prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  The crop protection market also remains under pressure  in part  due to a slowdown in Brazil  Lower insect pressure and reduced seed volumes are contributing to a weakening demand for crop protection products 
	While some prominent fertilizer names such as Potash Corp     NYSE POT    and CVR Partners     NYSE UAN    have already reported their results last week  a number of players in the space are scheduled to report this week 
	Let s take a peek at two major fertilizer companies that are warming up to report their results on May 4 The Mosaic Company    NYSE MOS     which will report before the bell on May 4  remains exposed to a difficult business environment in agriculture and pricing headwinds  Depressed pricing for potash and phosphate are expected to continue to weigh on its results in the to be reported quarter  The company s guidance also indicates a year over year fall in sales volumes for phosphate and potash for the first quarter   Read more    

Mosaic has an  of  21 43  and a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   making it difficult to predict an earnings beat  Mosaic has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the trailing 4 quarters with an average beat of 12 10  CF Industries Holdings  Inc     NYSE CF     which will report its first quarter numbers after the bell on May 4  continues to see pricing pressure in its nitrogen business  Weak prices for nitrogen fertilizers are expected to weigh on its sales and earnings in the first quarter  Abundant global supply is keeping prices under pressure   Read more    
	CF Industries  Zacks Rank  3  Hold  combined with an Earnings ESP of  11 77  makes surprise prediction difficult  The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 2 of the trailing 4 quarters while beating twice with an average negative surprise 9 31

149202,370718,CF,Agrium s  AGU  Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates  Sales Trail,opinion,"Agrium Inc    NYSE AGU   posted net earnings  attributable to its equity holders  of  2 million or 2 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016  a roughly 83  plunge from  12 million or 8 cents per share recorded a year ago  The bottom line was affected by weaker selling prices across all nutrients 
Barring one time items other than stock based payment expense  post tax  of 2 cents per share  Agrium s adjusted earnings came in at 3 cents per share  Analysts polled by Zacks were expecting a loss of 7 cents on an average 
Revenues decreased 5 1  year over year to  2 725 million in the reported quarter  The top line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 752 million 
Shares of the company rose 2 2  to close at  86 16 on May 4 
Segment Review
Revenues from the Retail segment increased 1 2  year over year to  2 29 billion  Gross profit rose 8 4  year over year to  402 million  The strong results were driven by solid margins across the company s major product offerings and lower operating costs  an early start to the spring application season in the U S  and record results in its South American operations 
Within the Retail business  crop nutrient sales declined nearly 8  year over year to  839 million  owing to weaker global pricing across all nutrients  The segment witnessed a 4  increase in sales volumes of crop nutrients  Crop protection sales went up 5  to  831 million as farmers in North American took advantage of the favorable weather to apply herbicides to control weeds  Seed sales increased 22  year over year to  376 million in the reported quarter while Merchandise sales fell 18  to  117 million 
Sales from the Wholesale segment came in at  649 million  down roughly 25 1  year over year  as realized sales prices were pressured by weaker nutrient prices globally  Gross profit was  153 million in the reported quarter  declining significantly from  234 million in the year ago quarter 
Within the Wholesale business  nitrogen gross profits fell roughly 33 6  year over year to  95 million  attributable to significantly lower global benchmark nitrogen prices  partly offset by reduced cost of production 
Sales volumes decreased roughly 2 6  year over year to 741 000 tons as Western Canadian dealers were slow in their nitrogen buying decisions early in the season  Potash sales volumes were 456 000 tons in the reported quarter compared to 185 000 tons in the prior year quarter  Phosphate sales volumes fell 22  to 220 000 tons 
Financial PositionAgrium ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  276 million  down roughly 64 6  year over year  Long term debt decreased around 2 6  year over year to  4 415 million as of Mar 31  2016  Cash provided by operations declined around 51 3  year over year to  343 million in the quarter OutlookAgrium  which is among the prominent fertilizer companies  along with Mosaic   NYSE MOS    Potash Corp    NYSE POT   and CF Industries   NYSE CF    provided its annual earnings guidance for 2016 in the range of  5 25  6 25 per share  down from its prior view of  5 50  7 00   The company lowered the guidance range due to a challenging pricing environment for all nutrients and expectations of a stronger Canadian dollar  partly offset by reduced natural gas costs and continued momentum in its Retail business  For the first half of 2016  Agrium expects earnings to be in the range of  4 00  4 30 per share 
Agrium also reduced its full year expectation for potash production to 2 3 2 4 million tons from the prior view of 2 4 2 6 million tons 
Retail crop nutrient sales tons for 2016 are now forecast to be in the range of 9 8 10 3 million tons  compared with 9 8 10 2 million tons expected earlier   The modest widening of the range is due to a projected increase in U S  planted corn acres

149225,370741,CF,CF Industries Now A Stock To Own,opinion,"Since putting in a double bottom at 233 in mid June  CF Industries  NYSE CF   has been making a series of higher lows and higher highs  In the parlance of technical analysis this equals a trend higher  This is a change of character for the stock price  What was a long flat channel is now a rising channel  This is now a stock to own purely from the price action 
But the other indicators also back up the story  As the price is clearing the July high in the chart below  the RSI is in the bullish zone and heading higher with a MACD that has crossed up and is rising  These both support the upside in the price continuing  The blue envelope  the Bollinger  bands  are also opening up on the top side as it approaches  to allow the move to continue  The center line of the Bollinger bands is roughly equivalent to the 100 day SMA  Notice that during the sideways action the price was below this level but during the entire prior move higher from July 2013 to March it was above this level  The price is also back above the line now 

This move started in May so you might think it is too late to get on board  But one measure of how far it could go is called a Measured Move  This looks at the prior move  from 168 to 268  and projects it higher  This would target a move to 333 by about late February  it if takes roughly as long as the last leg  So there is still a lot of potential in this one

149226,370742,CF,Case Study  When A Stock Rally Cools Down,opinion,"Stocks rise and stocks fall   this we all know  The tragedy is that the prevailing belief on Main Street is that you can only make money in the stock market if your portfolio holdings rise in price  This is among the greatest fallacies conveyed to the general investing public  After all  most retirement funds only assume long positions in the market  their bias is to the upside  and they under perform during market pullbacks 
Unlike Main Street  Wall Street plays the game both ways   professional traders make money during rallies and sell offs  The struggle between bears and bulls is zero sum   money never vanishes  it simply changes hands 
In this post  I am going to dissect the recent price action for CF Industries Holdings  Inc   NYSE CF  as a case study example of how to identify stocks as potential short candidates once strong price rallies show signs of cooling down    the company  is a manufacturer and distributor of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products worldwide  

The chart above displays two time frames of interest  the daily and the two hour views 
As is obvious  CF has had quite the rally since trading as low as  244 81 on 12 16  Having traded as high as  303 09 on Monday  the stock has gained nearly  60 a share in four weeks 
On the daily chart  the  300 level has shown itself to be a formidable resistance area  Bulls failed to close CF above  300 on 1 9 15  1 12 15 as well as Monday  despite having flirted with or even exceeded the  300 level intra day during all three trading sessions 
The 5 DMA is above the 9 DMA so the trend is still higher on the daily time frame  However  Monday s close was the first in which the bulls failed to close the stock above its open price  CF opened yesterday at  299 57 and closed at  299 24  For the prior five trading sessions  the opposite held true  as CF closed above its opening prices 
A close below the 5 DMA  currently at  295 91  would be a first for CF since 12 31  and could portend a further pullback in the near term  A congestion zone to watch for support on any sell off would be the  286  287 area 
In looking at the two hour chart  we can see that  DMI has remained above  DMI since mid December  indicative of the bulls dominating the price action 
However   DMI is beginning to creep up  as bears have applied selling pressure in recent days around the  300 level  Should  DMI surpass  DMI  this would point to a possible sentiment shift in favor of the bears 
The ADX line is no longer rising  so the strong trending move higher may have abated for now  and a range trade could be in play ",2015-01-14,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/case-study:-when-a-stock-rally-cools-down-238383,238383
149227,370743,CF,This Materials Sector Play Is Fundamentally Strong,opinion,"All too often  we see investors fixated on commodity prices when looking at Materials sector stocks  Oil  natural gas  corn  sugar and livestock are all important commodities that receive much attention and often serve as many Materials businesses  main inputs  While commodity prices may impact businesses  profits and stock price in the short term  investors can count on strong fundamentals to increase the value of Materials businesses over the long term 
There are a few great companies hidden underneath all of the chatter about agricultural commodity prices    and CF Industries  NYSE CF  is one  CF is the country s largest producer of a product that will always be in demand  nitrogen based agricultural fertilizer  While many investors watch agricultural output prices   corn  soybeans and wheat   as indicators for demand for fertilizer  CF s business is strong enough to generate cash flow no matter how cheap these crops may become in 2015  CF s products are a key component in the productivity of farms nationwide and its fertilizer ensures that the world s growing population will have enough to eat 
CF has been able to capitalize on this steady demand for its products  Since going public in 2005  CF has grown after tax operating profits  NOPAT  by 47  compounded annually  And over that time  the company has increased its after tax margins from 4  to an impressive 35    quite a feat in the Materials sector where products are usually prone to commoditization and low margins  While its possible these margins will fall going forward  CF s unmatched scale and cost advantage will allow it to maintain higher margins than competitors 
CF also earns a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  of over 21  and has earned positive free cash flow almost every year since its IPO  the exception being 2009  when it paid  4 7 billion to acquire a rival fertilizer maker   This healthy free cash flow allows CF to sustain its quarterly dividend of  1 50 
In addition to these already great fundamentals  low energy prices this year will be a boon for CF  Natural gas alone accounted for 41  of CF s cost of goods sold for fertilizers in 2013 
While CF s great fundamentals brought the stock up 20  in 2014  there s still value to be had here  At its current price of  314 share  CF has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 8  This number implies that the market expects CF s NOPAT to permanently decline by 20   This negative outlook seems rather off base given CF s history of profit growth  the tailwinds of low natural gas prices and its  2 1 billion plant expansion in Louisiana scheduled to open later this year  We think CF is seriously undervalued at its current price and warrants a closer look from investors

149231,370747,CF,Top Trade Ideas For The Week July 6  2015  CF Industries,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
CF Industries  CF  makes and distributes fertilizer  Exciting right  Not really  But the company has been around for almost 70 years and is thriving  In fact the entire fertilizer space has started to look attractive for investment 
The chart of the stock price shows a move higher out of broad consolidation to start the year and then a shallow pullback  This was a Cup  and the Handle of the pattern seems to be building in a broad wedge expansion 
The Measured Move to the upside on a break out targets 72 50  And the RSI is bullish and the MACD about to cross up  supporting a move higher  The Bollinger Bands  are also expanding  But the expanding wedge is often a topping pattern  So it needs to be watched for a breakdown  The target there would be a retracement to the prior low at 56 
This gives two trade opportunities  one to the upside and one to the downside  The options chain shows some size this week at the 65 and 66 strikes above  There is also large size at 64 50 in July and then in august it moves both ways  with size at 61 and 68 to 71 on the call side  but size at 57 and 60 on the put side 
Short interest is low under 1   and the company is expected to report earnings next August 6th 
CF Industries  Ticker  NYSE CF
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 66 with a stop at 64  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the August 66 Calls  offered at  1 67 late Friday   A defined risk method for participating to the upside 
Trade Idea 3  Buy the August 66 72 Call Spreads   1 40  and sell the August 60 Puts  86 cents   Giving more time but also capping the trade return in exchange for lower cost 
Trade Idea 4  Sell the stock short on a move under 62 25 with a stop at 63 75  A downside stock trade 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the July 62 5 Puts  58 cents  on the same trigger   Using defined risk to the downside 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the heat of Summer sees the Equity markets looking vulnerable on the short time frame and just sideways on the longer timeframe 
Elsewhere look for Gold to continue the broad consolidation with a downward bias while Crude Oil looks to move lower  The US Dollar Index looks to continue to consolidate in a tightening range sideways while US Treasuries are consolidating but biased lower  The Shanghai Composite is crashing and shows no sign of letting up yet while Emerging Markets may be bouncing in their downtrend  Volatility looks to remain low but above recent levels and with a risk of more upside easing the tailwind it has given the equity indexes 
The ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  themselves all appear vulnerable on the daily timeframe with the QQQ the strongest looking flat  On the longer timeframe the QQQ is also looking the strongest but has pulled back to trend support with the IWM looking weaker  Perhaps some rotation out of small caps and into technology and larger caps to come  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

149251,370767,CF,Insmed  Top Line Data Should Rally Stock,opinion,The Orphan Drug Act was passed in January 1983 to encourage companies to develop drugs that treat rare medical conditions  Companies that receive Orphan Drug Status gain certain financial incentives such as a longer period of exclusivity  enhanced patent protection  clinical research financial subsidization  and even tax breaks  Additionally  companies have greater success in getting their Orphan Drugs approved because there is a significant need for its treatments  Insmed  INSM  is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops targeted inhaled therapies for those suffering from debilitating orphan lung diseases  Insmed focuses on cystic fibrosis patients with pseudomonas lung infections and also those with non tuberculosis mycobacterial lung infections  Patients with cystic fibrosis develop a sticky mucous that can clog the lungs and encourage pathogens  such as Pseudomonas  to settle and infect the lung  These infections are very difficult to eradicate and there is no cure  however  current treatments focus on reducing inflammation and preserving lung function for as long as possible  Insmed is working on developing a better treatment for these patients with its lead product Arikace Arikace uses liposomal amikacin as an inhaled antibiotic  which so far in trials has shown to have better efficacy  safety  and patient compliance than other treatments  Insmed has been granted Orphan Drug Status in both the United States and European Union for Pseudomonas lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients  Recently  Insmed was also granted Orphan Drug Status for Arikace in treating those with non tuberculous mycobacterial lung infections  In mid 2013  Insmed is reporting top line clinical results from its Phase III trial for Arikace to treat cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas lung infections  In the fourth quarter 2013 Insmed will also report Phase II results for patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria Proprietary Liposomal TechnologyInsmed uses its proprietary liposomal technology to create an antibiotic that is both safer and more effective  They use a layered lipid as a drug delivery system by alternating molecules with hydrophilic heads  water loving  and hydrophobic tails  water hating   This creates a lipid bilayer with water in the core and between each layer  Drugs that are water soluble are placed in the liposome s core and those that are not are placed in the membrane layers  Insmed then manipulates the charges of the antibiotic to ensure effective delivery into the infection  Typically  antibiotics like amikacin are positively charged and immediately bind to the negatively charged compounds produced by the bacteria in the lungs  This is troubling because it limits the penetration of the drug into the deep lung tissue  where treatment would be more effective  By making its Arikace liposomes neutrally charged  the drug is able to penetrate and treat these infections deeper than current approved treatments The ability of the drug to be delivered more effectively and closer to the source of the infection should lead to a better efficacy and safety profile  The liposomes contain high concentrations of the drug and are able to deliver localized treatment in the lungs  This should also lead to less toxicity and fewer adverse reactions  Insmed also pairs Arikace with its proprietary eFlow Nebulizer System to deliver concentrated treatment directly to the site of the infection  So far this has led to better patient compliancebecause patients have to administer less treatments for a shorter amount of time to achieve beneficial results Cystic Fibrosis Patients with Pseudomonas Lung InfectionsAbout 70  of patients with cystic fibrosis develop a chronic lung infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa  This infection causes a mucous build up that leads to inflammation and lung deterioration  In fact  patients lose from 1  to 3  of their lung function each year of infection  Since there is no existing cure  life expectancy is very short  with the average patient living 37 years  There is an urgent need for a treatment with better efficacy  safety  and durability Currently  Novartis  NVS  markets an inhaled tobramycin  termed TOBI  for psuedomonas lung infections in cystic fibrosis However  Novartis  TOBI has shown significant disadvantages when compared to Arikace  Novartis s therapy takes up to 3 hours per day and requires two or three sessions of dosing  Arikace is the first ever once daily treatment for this indication and leads to an increased patient compliance  Furthermore  the dosing schedule is 28 days on and 56 days off  which is a significant advantage over current therapies In Phase III trials  TOBI also showed that lung function declined to baseline or lower at the end of 24 weeks of treatment  In Insmed s Phase II trials  Arikace showed statistically significant improvement in function throughout the 28 day treatment period  and that improvement was sustained through the off treatment period  Furthermore  resistance to TOBI by the bacteria has increased by 85  since 1999  so a new treatment is in dire need Patients with Non Tuberculous Mycobacteria Lung InfectionsInsmed s Arikace is being tested for use on patients with non tubercuous mycobacteria  NTM  lung infections  There are about 50 000 patients in the United States with this condition and there are no approved treatments available Patients now require about 7 6 courses of antibiotics and 10 2 hospital days per year to help cope with the infection  but each year the infection gets progressively worse  For those patients over 65  40  are more likely to die  The FDA has given Orphan Drug Status to Arikace for this indication as well because it is an unmet need  While still currently in Phase II trials  Insmed believes Arikace can become the first approved treatment for NTM Lung Infections Non CF Bronchiectasis Patients with Pseudomonas Lung InfectionsThe third application for Arikace is for patients with non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients with Psedomonas lung infections  There are more than 250 000 patients in the United States with this medical condition and there are no approved antibiotics  Insmed has Orphan Drug Status for this indication as well and has seen positive results from its Phase II study  We have reported favorable results from our Phase 2 study  TR02 107  ARIKACE randomized  placebo controlled phase 2 clinical study results in which the drug was administered once daily for 28 days demonstrated an improvement in time to pulmonary exacerbations reduced need for anti Pseudomonas rescue treatment  a decrease in Pseudomonas Log CFUs and a decrease in frequency of cough with expectoration  The study also revealed that ARIKACE was well tolerated with adverse events consistent with underlying chronic lung disease in bronchiectasis patients  Patients in the 560 mg cohort had a slightly higher frequency of dry cough than those in the 280 mg cohort  but the cough was of short duration  was self limiting  and did not result in any physician choosing to discontinue a patient from the study With more than 250 000 patients in the United States with this condition and no approved treatment  Insmed is set to capture a large market if the company is able to get Arikace approved for this indication Near Term CatalystInsmed is expecting to report Phase III trial results for Arikace to treat cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas lung infections in the middle of 2013  It is stated in the company s recent First Quarter Financial Results Completed the patient treatment period of the Company s registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of ARIKACE   the Company s Iiposomal amikacin for inhalation  to treat cystic fibrosis  CF  patients with Pseudomonas lung infections in Europe and Canada and remain on track to report top line clinical results from the trial in mid 2013  In 2012  treatments for pseudomonas lung infections in CF generated about  424 million in sales  with Novartis capturing about  317 million from TOBI and Gilead Sciences  Cayston capturing  107 million  If Phase III trials are successful and the drug is ultimately approved  Insmed should be able to capture a large portion of the market share Future CatalystsInsmed is also expecting to report Phase II results later in 2013  Also stated in the company s recent First Quarter Financial Results Report  Insmed s U S  Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with NTM  nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infections  is well underway with clinical results expected in late 2013  Since this is an indication with no approved treatment and 50 000 patients in the United States  positive results from this trial would be a large milestone for the future of the company  In small cap biotech companies it is important to develop a drug that can capture market share  however  it is equally important to have a management team who can execute  Developmental biotech companies most often are not profitable and continually burn through cash until its drug is approved by the FDA and becomes marketable  Thus  having an experienced management team is key when it comes to smartly utilizing funds and achieving milestones in a timely manner From the picture above  we can see that Insmed has a proven management  with executives that worked on developing multibillion dollar companies  Will Lewis  President and CEO of Insmed  was the co founder and former president of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals  AEGR   which ran from about  14 to  46 in less than a year  Noting some other big names in management  CFO Andy Drechsler worked at Abbott Labs  ABT   EVP Development and CMO Renu Gupta worked at Novartis  VP of Manufacturing Peter Clarke worked at Bayer  and Nicole Schaeffer worked at Amicus Therapeutics  FOLD   From Insmed s April Presentation the company has enough cash to fund operations through 2013  Insmed has  92 9 million in cash and are expecting to burn between  45 and  55 million this year  On September 27 2012 the company raised approximately  26 million in a direct public offering  so shareholders should not expect the company to do another raise any time soon  To understand where Insmed stock price might go in the coming months  we need to take a look at the above daily two year chart  From the two drawn horizontal lines  we can see that there is still a huge gap to be filled  From its last run  stock price has flagged down to about the top of the previous peak  This should act as support and a base for the next run higher  On Monday  it bounced off its previous  8 20 peak and created a nice bullish engulfing candle  As we get closer to the catalyst date  I expect that the stock runs to a minimum of  11 00 to fill the gap A company with a similar chart is Cornerstone Therapeutics  CRTX   Cornerstone had a gap down on gap down from about  6 20 to  5 10 on a negative Adcomm on September 13  2012  Months later  this gap was filled and the price is currently at  8 79  ConclusionInsmed has positioned itself to capture market share for several indications with unmet needs  With a near term catalyst and another later on in the year  I expect that Insmed stock price will climb in anticipation of the clinical trial results  Insmed has experienced management and should be able to execute on its plan to make Arikace the leading treatment in its field  My short term price target is  11 00 per share  If Phase III results are positive my price target is  15  per share  Negative results would likely see a stock price back under  5 a share  Disclosure  I am long INSM  Disclaimer

149280,370796,CF,Porter Stansberry  End The Ban On US Oil Exports,opinion,Porter Stansberry doesn t mince words  Politicians  Scumbags  People in general  Lazy  Laws against oil exports  Disastrous  In this interview with The Energy Report  the Stansberry   Associates Investment Research founder argues that oil exports could usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity  if legislation would only allow it  However  he says there s no holding back U S  energy wealth  the profits will sprout up in oil  and gas related industries like fertilizer  petrochemicals and shipping  Find out where Stansberry is putting his money  This time  it s not on E Ps  The Energy Report  As a history enthusiast  Porter  to what extent do you believe technology has changed investing  Porter Stansberry  The future will be unlike the past in every way related to technology  but it will be exactly like the past as it relates to people  Technology changes a great deal  but people don t  You can count on politicians to be scumbags and most people to be lazy  But as for investing  technology gives far more people access to information  Only one person in the world knew the actual price of a high yield bond 25 years ago Michael Milken and he made a fortune with that information advantage  Today  everybody has access to trading information  Everyone has access to price  In general  technology has made finance a smaller margin business  It s led to enormous scale in our financial institutions  which is the only way they can really survive  But fear and greed are still the underlying forces that drive the markets  and investors are just as subject to irrational emotional decisions as they ve ever been  I don t expect technology will ever change that  TER  Getting specifically into energy  a few weeks ago the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook  WEO  said the U S  would become the world s largest oil producer  overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia  before 2020  Then Goldman Sachs said it would happen by 2017  PS  They stole my thunder  I ve been saying 2017 for maybe a year now  If Goldman is saying 2017 and IEA is saying 2020 it will probably happen in 2016  TER  How will the geopolitical and socioeconomic landscape change when the U S  becomes the largest oil producer  PS  One of the biggest drags on the U S  dollar over the last several decades has been the trade deficit resulting from petroleum imports  That s going to largely disappear  though not completely because we ll still need some petroleum imports for certain flavors of crude  As for exports  considerable legal hurdles remain  We have archaic laws about oil because we had long believed that oil was a strategic resource and that the world was going to run out of it in the short term  Unless we change our laws to allow exports of crude oil  none of this magnificent new supply is going to aid our economy at all  In fact  we ll have a terrific glut of oil  and we re already at record levels of storage  The price hasn t collapsed yet because unrest in the Middle East is causing fear to inflate the market price  but the price will absolutely collapse if we don t allow for oil exports  The entrepreneurs who brought us this incredible new supply would  in that scenario  suffer  and many companies would go bankrupt because the oil industry is not capitalized to survive  50 barrel  bbl  oil  But to answer your question how the geopolitical and socioeconomic landscape will change when the U S  becomes the largest oil producer I d have to know the unknowable  which is how or if oil policy will adapt  So far  it doesn t look good  So far  12 companies have applied for licenses to export LNG  and only one license has been granted  I don t think the Obama administration is ever going to do anything to help the domestic oil industry  And I think that the result will be a price collapse and an oil glut that will harm our economy  TER  You mentioned one company has a license  Who is that  PS  The Department of Energy granted a conditional permit to Cheniere Energy Inc   LNG NYSE MKT   It s an ironic story  For many years I was a short seller in the stock  In fact  I published an article in 2006 when the stock was trading between  30 and  40 per share  I wrote that this company s business model was beyond stupid and had ventured into insane territory  Its plan was to import LNG into the United States and the company built a  6 billion   6B  facility  the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal  to bring in natural gas from Qatar  I said it was insane because not only was the U S  on the verge of a huge glut of natural gas  but for decades the U S  had either the largest or second largest reservoir of gas anywhere in the world  So the U S  importing natural gas is like Saudi Arabia importing sand  It doesn t make any sense  Of course  natural gas prices collapsed and Cheniere almost went bankrupt  It saved itself by selling new equity to a very smart group in New York  Blackstone Group  With the money raised from Blackstone Group  Cheniere switched that facility from imports to exports and applied for an export license long before government officials thought any market for U S  export gas would materialize  Cheniere got lucky  TER  To what extent will manufacturing and petrochemical industries move to the U S  to take advantage of cheap natural gas prices  PS  There s roughly  40B worth of construction going on in the chemical industry  You ll see the same kind of growth in fertilizer  You re also going to see huge growth  which hasn t really started yet  in refined products  Imagine it this way  If the government won t allow exporting energy in the form of crude oil  then you can damn well bet that entrepreneurs will find a way to export that energy in some other form  Fertilizer is energy rich and easy to ship  so we ll have a huge boom in domestic fertilizer production  How about propane  There s no law against exporting propane  Targa Resources Corp   TRGP NYSE   a company we recommend  is expanding its Mont Belvieu import export complex to boost propane export capacity  The funny thing is the energy will find a way out of the country  That ll be good for our economy  but it s so inefficient  We ll have enormous investments in all these industries surrounding the energy complex that are much lower margin  It would make so much more sense to just export the oil  TER  But wouldn t bringing in more production manufacturing have the additional advantage of creating jobs  PS  Yes  but it s not the highest and best use of our time  our capital or our people  This is something important about economics that people do not understand at all comparative advantage  The U S  has enormous comparative advantage in lots of different industries  Manufacturing is not one of them  Neither are giant refineries  Yet that s what we ll be stuck with  TER  What would change the equation  PS  There s really no easy answer  It s mind boggling  Imagine for a moment where Saudi Arabia would be today if it hadn t exported its oil  It could have a huge petrochemical business and be the world s leading producer of fertilizer and plastics  But guess what  The fact that Saudi Arabia put its resources to their highest and best use made it one of the richest countries in the world  TER  So maybe we should export oil rather than gas  PS  Absolutely  To make natural gas as our main export energy source would cost trillions to build enough of these terminals and it would take decades  Why not just hook up a pipeline of crude oil to a tanker and be done with it  Natural gas is so clearly better suited for domestic energy needs  We should export the crude and use the gas domestically  but that s not what will happen  We ll end up with higher prices on domestic crude with very little export and that ll be disastrous  TER  You ve described shale oil and natural gas in North America as one of the biggest investment opportunities  How do you reconcile that outlook with depressed prices  PS  You can be very bullish on production without being bullish on price  In fact  I think that s the only logical position  When natural gas was at  4 5 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf   I said it would go below  3 Mcf and people thought I was out of my mind  It s not only gone below  3 Mcf  it s essentially stayed there since 2008 or 2009  As you drill more horizontal wells  as production in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken and other places soars just look at oil storage  We ve never seen this much oil in storage in the U S  There s no doubt the price will crack eventually  and when it does it will crack hard  I ve been telling my subscribers not to buy the exploration and production  E P  companies but to buy the companies that are able to use lower energy prices to their advantage in their own markets  such as fertilizer companies and terminal and shipping stocks  such as Targa  You can find opportunities coming about in lots of little nooks and crannies because of the excess energy supply  TER  What are some other examples of energy related opportunities  PS  The big way is to play lower energy cost in the U S   or just to find any business that uses energy and can get a retail price for the product  Think about Calpine Corp   CPN NYSE   an unregulated producer that converts natural gas into electricity  The price of electricity in wholesale markets is dominated by coal generated electricity  so Calpine stock price is essentially a way to arbitrage the price of natural gas and the price of coal  If gas remains cheaper than coal  Calpine s earnings will go up and that s what I believe  Another good example is fertilizer  About 75  of the cost of fertilizer is made up of natural gas but the price of fertilizer is based on supply and demand  Global demand for food  of course  continues to grow quite rapidly  and due to the inflation of the dollar  farm prices continue to rise  so there s plenty of capital for buying fertilizer  This is another simple way to play and there are lots of good fertilizer stocks out there  The one we ve recommended is called CF Industries Holdings Inc   CF NYSE   And  then  of course  look for companies that are constructing the pipelines  making the steel for them  handling the storage  building the terminals  We ve recommended lots of those companies  TER  When you mentioned businesses that take advantage of lower energy costs  you mentioned those building terminals  Why would we want more terminals if the law won t allow exporting oil  PS  Terminals aren t necessarily just for export  but also storage and distribution  We need huge new storage facilities  huge new pipelines and huge new terminals all across the country mostly to move gas but also NGLs and crude oil  Right now we re using railroad cars to move crude out of the Bakken in North Dakota  which is very inefficient  TER  Whereas producers need higher prices to sustain the production costs  PS  Mostly  yes  Operating costs are actually very low once the wells are in place  To drill a well in the Eagle Ford  for example  costs about  7M  but you can make that back from production in 90 days  The problem these companies face is the cost of buying additional acreage  As soon as people know oil s around  real estate prices go bananas and companies have to borrow tons of capital to buy the leases and drill before the leases expire  This puts tremendous capital pressure on their balance sheets  The number one thing to be careful of right now in this space is the oil companies that have been rewarded for building huge real estate portfolios but have done so with tons of borrowed money  That puts these companies in a precarious financial position if the price of oil falls  It s not because they can t produce oil for  35 bbl  They can  However  they wouldn t be able to pay off the debt on their balance sheets  TER  Considering the glut of natural gas  do you foresee changes in the way U S  consumers use energy  PS  We ve already seen a huge shift in what I ll call the robust transportation sector  the big trucks and the buses  moving into natural gas  That s absolutely going to continue and it s going to grow  However  to build these things in a way that s safe requires a big  heavy vehicle  so I don t think you ll see that at the retail level  Most people in the U S  don t understand the role that energy plays in our economy  They don t understand that the boom from 1900 to 1925 was fueled mostly by the oil found at Spindletop in Texas  They don t understand that all the success we had in World War II and the boom that led to the1950s and 1960s came from east Texas  Literally the energy that drove all of that productive capacity came out of the ground with the east Texas discovery of 1930  The size of the discoveries found recently dwarf that  East Texas ended up being a 4B bbl field of oil  Every one of these new major shale plays contains 20B bbl of recoverable oil all five times bigger than east Texas and more than 20 of them are currently being drilled  We re sitting on the biggest economic and financial boom in the history of our country and we re strangling it  TER  If indeed we re sitting on all this gas  why doesn t the price of gasoline at the pumps go down  And if natural gas can create electricity  why aren t we seeing more electric cars  PS  Because electric cars don t work  How many dead Fiskers do you need to see before you realize they re not reliable  The hybrids are fine because they re still using gasoline to drive them  If it makes it good for you to turn gasoline into electricity before it spins your wheels  it s fine with me  But it s completely unnecessary  In regard to electric power  we don t have the battery technology yet to make this work  It s not even close  That would be great but it s naive to think we can plug all of our cars into the power grid  Can you imagine if everyone could overnight just plug all their cars into the power grid  By the way  all those power plants would be coal or natural gas  so you d still be consuming hydrocarbons  So electric cars are just fantasy devices  They don t make sense technologically  economically or ecologically  And as for prices at the pump  a very important thing that people don t get at all is that gasoline isn t oil  It s a derivative of oil  The lower price of oil will increase the crack spread  which will make refiners more profitable  But gasoline comes from refineries  and no new refineries have been built in the United States since 1974  If you want cheaper gasoline  guess what you have to build  TER  Refineries but earlier you said that s not a good use of capital  PS  It is not a good use of capital for export but it s incredibly important for the domestic market  And guess who sponsors the green politicians who don t want any refineries built  The refining companies  They don t want any more competition  People think the Keystone XL Pipeline didn t get built from Canada to the U S  because the Obama administration s full of these ecologist folks  No  The pipeline didn t get built because the E P companies in America don t want to compete with Canadian crude  TER  Any other insights you d like to give to readers of The Energy Report  PS  Yes  If they want to know what s ahead for the oil markets  study the natural gas markets from 2008 through 2010  because the same technologies are being used in the same fields and the result will be exactly the same  There s going to be a glut of domestic oil  and the oil companies that have leveraged their balance sheets to buy lots of acreage will have a very hard time  TER  Assuming of course that we don t change some laws to allow exports  PS  In that case  everything would change overnight  First of all  the global price of oil would equalize between West Texas Intermediate and Brent  at somewhere around  100 bbl  The profits these U S  companies would make would be fantastic for our economy and it would be great for the shareholders  Unfortunately  the odds say that American politicians won t make any kind of wise economic choice  That only happens by accident  TER  Let s keep our fingers crossed for a serendipitous accident  then  Thanks  Porter   founded Stansberry   Associates Investment Research  a private

149281,370797,CF,Robert Winslow  Bright Spots In The Fertilizer Market ,opinion,Global population growth and escalating food demand underpins long term upside for potash  phosphate and nitrogen producers  but fertilizer oligopolies may have jumped the gun last year with aggressive rates that priced farmers out of the market  As farmers expand acreage rather than boost yields in now tired fields  grain prices have backed off recent highs  That s why Robert Winslow  agriculture research analyst and director at National Bank Financial  is picking his stocks with care  In this interview with The Energy Report  he shares where he sees strengths and weaknesses in the industry and names some interesting contrarian plays  The Energy Report  Your last  took place in April of 2011  What have been the major developments on the agricultural front impacting the fertilizer markets since then  Robert Winslow  Increased weather volatility  like last summer s drought in the U S   which led to modern era highs in corn  wheat and soybean prices  have had a significant impact on the market  Although grain prices have softened of late  I believe you re likely to see somewhat higher than usual grain prices through at least the first half of 2013  given the persistent dryness in the U S  corn belt and wheat growing regions  Grain prices drive farmer sentiment and buying  and therefore the price and the demand for fertilizer  We ve seen some disconnects when it comes to potash  such as in India  Because the rupee was devalued about 20  through 2012  Indian farmers can t afford to pay the prices that the potash companies would charge  and this resulted in subdued demand  Chinese demand has been somewhat subdued as well  Globally  we ve had this really interesting dichotomy with high grain prices buoying larger demand in places like North America and even Brazil  but softening demand in yet other parts of the world with country specific issues  In total  we haven t seen the demand strength in potash that you might have otherwise expected with this high grain price environment  Some would say it s partly because grain prices are not sustainable at these high levels  We are actually of that view  Like any commodity  when the price gets too high  two very simple things play out  demand destruction and supply response  You ve seen demand destruction over the last 3 6 months  For example  high cost ethanol plants have been shuttering production  High cost producers of cattle  pigs and chickens have been culling their herds because they can t afford the feed costs unless meat prices rise in conjunction  which they have not  Then there s supply response  Farmers are expanding acreage by moving into marginal land  You may not get robust yield on that land  but you can still increase production  which we re seeing play out now  Brazil is expected to increase soybean acreage by 8 10  this year  With these dynamics playing out  the grain prices are beginning to come down  We expect that by the second half of 2013 you should start to see lower fertilizer demand reflected in pricing  even in the U S  and Brazil  That is why we maintain a fairly cautious view on the fertilizer sector at this stage  TER  How might continuing climate change and severe weather affect grain prices and fertilizer demand  RW  Nobody really knows the answer  I don t pretend to  but I will say that the stocks to use ratio for grains right now  globally  is about 68 69 days of supply  It s relatively tight compared to the last 30 years or so  and it doesn t take much to tip over and get a real spike or falloff in grain prices  When you do get these supply shocks through floods or droughts  the relatively tight supply situation can move prices quite dramatically  which we saw just this past year  Many investors don t believe such price spikes are sustainable and they aren t going to pay for them  We re probably at least two years away from where we have a bit more of a buffer in the stocks use ratio to get us away from this tightness that is causing more volatility in the grain price  In the meantime  we can expect continued volatility in both grains and fertilizer equities  TER  How have the various segments of the fertilizer industry performed in the last year and a half  RW  Potash has been the commodity with the most interest  We ve been a bit of an outlier in the investment community  with a rather bearish view on both the commodity itself and on some of the senior potash producer equities  We are of the view that the potash oligopolies  and we all know who they are  have been rather aggressive with their pricing  In a perfect world  you might be able to raise your prices every year  but we don t live in a perfect world  Places like India just couldn t afford the higher prices  so they bought less  The oligopolies and agronomists are right in saying that parts of the world  like India and China  need more potash in the soil  but ultimately  demand is price dependent  In 2012  global potash demand looked to be in the neighborhood of 50 million tonnes  50 Mmt   which is below the levels we saw back in 2004  Thus  the commodity usage has been basically flat to down over the last 7 8 years not a compelling investment theme  But the potash price more than tripled over that period  This aggressive pricing has since come back to bite the oligopolies  I expect a demand recovery in 2013 because India has been under applying fertilizer  and it will need to make up for that at some point  I doubt India would purchase its full allocation  which would be 6 7 Mmt  unless it can buy potash near or below  400 Mmt  And if it does buy the 6 7 Mmt  then there s a good chance India might buy less again in 2014  with Indian farmers trying to mine the soil  Of course  if the rupee comes back with vigor  India would have more buying power  On the supply side  there s tremendous brownfield supply expected over the next three to four years  Most of it is coming from the oligopolies themselves  It looks like the global supply will be growing about 4  per year  on average  over the next four years  So if your demand is flat and supply is up 4  per year  it doesn t bode well for potash prices  That doesn t include the greenfield supply that could come on from BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK   K S Potash Canada  SDFG FSE  or any of the juniors that are working to build mines  So the supply demand dynamics are not  in our view  compelling for potash over the next two years  particularly if we get less volatile global weather patterns and grain prices trend down  TER  How do the prospects look in the other fertilizer segments  RW  Phosphate is looking rather interesting here  Not unlike potash  there s a bit of an oligopoly situation  with Morocco controlling half or so of the global phosphate rock market  It appears that Moroccans really want to move more into the higher margin business  Instead of just selling rock to the world  they figure they can make monoammonium phosphate and diammonium phosphate  which are finished fertilizer products  This will make it rather challenging for the non integrated phosphate producers and or companies that still rely on imported rock  U S  phosphate producers like The Mosaic Co   MOS NYSE  and Agrium Inc   AGU NYSE  AGU TSX   for example  rely or expect to rely to some extent on Moroccan rock  On the other hand  that should provide some interesting opportunities for the greenfield phosphate companies  certainly in North America  that are developing phosphate deposits  There are a couple of companies in particular that you might want to keep an eye on  One is d Arianne Resources Inc   DAN TSX V  DRRSF OTCBB  JE9N FSE  and the other is Stonegate Agricom Ltd   ST TSX  SNRCF OTCPK   Both are working on projects here in North America  The next few years could be interesting for them  TER  Then how about the nitrogen products  RW  Unlike potash and phosphate  nitrogen isn t reliant on ore bodies  It s produced all over the world  so you don t get the sort of concentration you get in potash and phosphate  If you re investing in that sector  you have to be a little careful  because we believe that nitrogen producers in North America  in particular  are near peak margins due to the low price of natural gas  which is a big input component  In our view  you shouldn t generally buy equities that are about to post peak earnings and peak margins  especially when the market already expects those peak results  Two companies in particular  Agrium Inc   AGU NYSE  AGU TSX  and CF Industries Holdings Inc   CF NYSE   have share prices near their all time highs  and the market s already valuing some pretty robust results for them  We would be very cautious  and  in fact  we have an Underperform rating on Agrium  That stock s trading a little over  102 today  and we have an  87 50 target on it  TER  How are current commodity and financial market conditions affecting plans for junior mining companies in the project development stage  RW  It s a challenging time  Finance risk is the key challenge for a lot of these junior companies  whether it s potash or phosphate  That means that if you have an ore body or an asset  it needs to have some competitive advantages  for example by being a low cost operation either at the mine level or through low distribution costs  We look at projects like Allana Potash Corp   AAA TSX  ALLRF OTCQX  in Ethiopia  for example  which looks to be well positioned as a low cost operation at the mine gate and could be one of the lowest cost delivered potash suppliers into India  which has no domestic potash  Companies are better off when they have these types of strategic advantages  but at the end of the day  the finance risk is still an overwhelming one today  There is one development stage fertilizer company that we re most intrigued by  and that s MBAC Fertilizer Corp   MBC TSX  MBCFFOTCQX   because its finance risk is now largely behind it it is about to move into production in the next few months or so  It has a phase one phosphate project in Brazil called Itafos  right in the Cerrado  which is the breadbasket of Brazil  It also has another phosphate asset to the north of the Cerrado  This company has a logistic advantage because half of the phosphate fertilizer manufactured in Brazil uses imported rock from Africa  We are extremely interested in this stock and it has our Top Pick rating in the sector  We have a  5 25 target on the stock with an Outperform rating  Frankly  the company is a potential acquisition target because there are parties that appear to be aiming to consolidate the phosphate fertilizer sector in Brazil  We believe MBAC Fertilizer is one to own for 2013  TER  It s nice to see some blue sky on the horizon  RW  I m not a complete bear on the sector  There are some bright spots in my coverage list  TER  Do you expect any other interesting M A activity in this industry due to current market conditions  RW  I don t see much particularly different about 2013 versus 2012 as far as the macro call goes  There s been expectation for some time that the Indians and or Chinese would come in and buy up more of the junior fertilizer companies to help secure supply  particularly in the potash sector  That just hasn t happened yet  One thing that s different about 2013 is that there should be a number of bankable feasibility studies completed this year  which will help derisk a number of the early stage projects  It looks like Allana Potash is expecting its bankable feasibility any day now and d Arianne Resources is expecting a bankable feasibility mid year  Elemental Minerals Ltd   ELM TSX  ELM ASX  EMINF OTCPK  has a bankable study expected in the second half of 2013 on its potash project in the Republic of the Congo  Even IC Potash Corp   ICP TSX  ICPTF OTCQX   which is a company looking to develop a sulfate of potash fertilizer project in the U S   expects a bankable study in mid  to late 2013 as well  There are number of bankable feasibility studies coming  which will help derisk these projects and could spur some investment by the likes of the Indians  the Chinese and even the Brazilians as they look to secure fertilizer  but time will tell  Because finance risk is quite significant for these companies  they ultimately need strategic partnerships and or offtake agreements to help mitigate that risk  So as these studies come out in the next 6 12 months  that could change the equation for many of them  We ll have to wait and see how that plays out  TER  You talked about MBAC  which you like  What s the situation with PotashCorp   POT TSX  POT NYSE   RW  We re bearish on that one  I believe we have the only Sell rating for that stock on Bay Street and Wall Street  So if you like contrarian views  that s us  The potash commodity supply demand situation is not particularly compelling  In terms of valuation  we look at that company as having mid cycle earnings around  3 05 a share in our 2014 estimate  A typical multiple on mid cycle earnings tells us this stock is overvalued at  41 42  The Street and most analysts seem to love it  They believe it s worth  50   Considering the cyclical downside potential for grain  we re not of that view  We had a sell on it for most of 2012 and it s been the right call  We ll have to see how 2013 plays out  TER  What do you see ahead for fertilizer producers and how can investors position themselves in this industry  if they like the future prospects  RW  It s as simple as this  The correlation between grain prices and agricultural equities  particularly the fertilizers  is quite high  Grain prices have retreated of late but still appear to have more downside risk than upside and we would argue over the next year or so  barring unforeseen supply shocks  the trend for grain prices is for further downside  If you re of that view  then the bias for the agricultural equities would be down as well  So we re pretty cautious here  We d be inclined to sell into strength  if these agricultural equities rally  and focus more on the supply demand fundamentals for grains  With that view  we have only a select few buys and we re more cautious with a number of sells in our universe  TER  And there s a little bit of news on the horizon for mid year with some of the smaller companies if they can get their act together  RW  That s correct  on the bankable feasibility studies coming out  TER

149309,370825,CF,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Materials Sector,opinion,The Materials sector ranks sixth out of the ten sectors as detailed in my sector rankings for ETFs and mutual funds  It gets my Neutral rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 10 ETFs and 15 mutual funds in the Materials sector as of October 9  2012  Figure 1 ranks from best to worst all ten Materials ETFs and Figure 2 shows the five best and worst rated Materials mutual funds  Not all Materials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 31 to 155   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Materials sector  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any Materials ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this sector  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5   Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity Sources

Attractive or better rating  However  none of the ten Materials and none of the fifteen Materials mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating The key takeaway is  in the Materials sector  both ETFs and mutual funds are poor at allocating value to Attractive or better ranked stocks  Investors would be better served to purchase individual Materials sector stocks on their own  rather than paying fund operators expensive fees to do it for them Figure 3  Materials Sector Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   StocksSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering Materials ETFs and mutual funds  as no funds receive an Attractive or better rating  No ETFs or mutual funds in the Materials sector allocate enough value to Attractive or better rated stocks to earn an Attractive rating  Focus on individual stocks instead  A Materials sector stock that receives my Very Attractive rating is CF Industries Holdings  Inc   CF   Unlike many of the stocks held by Materials funds  CF is a highly profitable company with a reasonable valuation  CF produces fertilizer  While selling fertilizer may not be as exciting as social media or online gaming  CF has an economic earnings margin of 18   This places it 10th out of the 167 Materials companies we cover and in the 94  percentile of our entire coverage universe  The Materials sector features 34 stocks with a Very Attractive or Attractive rating  Investors would be wise to invest in a selection of these stocks rather than investing in any Materials sector funds  Coeur D alene Mines Corp  CDE  is one of my least favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and receives my Dangerous rating  CDE earns this Dangerous rating due to its inability to generate a ROIC in excess of its WACC  While CDE had positive net income in 2011  its 6 4  ROIC was less than its 9 5  WACC  leading to negative economic earnings  At the same time  the stock s current valuation    28 76 share  implies the company must grow revenues at 25  compounded annually for 15 years  That is too rich for my blood  While there are several attractive stocks in the Materials sector  CDE is not one of them  167 stocks of the 3000  I cover are classified as Materials stocks  but due to style drift  Materials ETFs and mutual funds hold 224 stocks  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Materials ETFs and mutual funds

149316,370832,CF,Carolyn Dennis  Dishing The Dirt On Fertilizer Stocks,opinion,Dundee Capital Markets is building out its fertilizer and agriculture platform and sees good reason for investors to do the same  Yields from the big names in the space are driving investor interest  according to Carolyn Dennis  vice president and senior equities analyst  while exposure to the bigger names in potash can be a good defensive move  Juniors  on the other hand  have a harder row to hoe  Read more in this exclusive Energy Report interview  The Energy Report  Carolyn  what will the global potash market look like in Q4 12  Carolyn Dennis  Indications are that the potash market will be slow in Q4 12  largely due to the expected delay of contracts in China and India until late 2012 or early 2013  As a result of this delay  both PotashCorp   POT TSX  POT NYSE  and Uralkali  URKA RTS  URKA MCX  URKA LSE  announced inventory related shutdowns in October  The good news is that demand in North America appears to be normal   There had been some concern that farmers would apply less potash this year due to early harvests and droughts   We also expect some support from Brazil because it went into its planting season with high crop prices  TER  But the picture is a little bit different for other nutrients  demand for nitrogen is higher than potash right now  correct  CD  We expect relatively normal growth in nitrogen specifically urea and ammonia  That market is growing in the 1 5 2  range  urea is growing faster than ammonia   While potash and phosphate application can be skipped for periods of time  nitrogen is applied to the soil every year  so we expect relatively normal demand there  The phosphate market  in comparison  has been relatively soft  In general  most of the nutrients have been exhibiting softening growth profiles going into early 2013  TER  Just a couple of years ago  demand for potash was expected to grow at 4 5   Two percent growth is far off that expectation  What happened  CD  We are forecasting that over the next couple of years  potash growth will be over 3   higher than nitrogen and phosphate  which are around 1 5 2   India  in particular  has cut back on potash application recently  At some point  Indian farmers will have to add potash to the soil because going too long without potash will damage the soil  In the short term  issues in India such as subsidies will affect demand  but in the longer term we expect potash demand growth to return  We never really achieved that 4 5  growth rate on a prolonged basis  but we expect potash demand to grow marginally higher than the other two nutrients going forward  TER  What is the demand story in China  CD  Demand has been relatively flat  but while purchases are down  built up inventories are depleting  Therefore  we expect growth in the new year  although that growth is likely to be on the low side  China buys its potash on contract  as does India  With the Indians delaying their contract  the Chinese have likely been waiting to see what the new price will be  However  on PotashCorp s recent quarterly call  it was indicated that the Chinese were currently in negotiation and expected to finalize a contract by the end of the year  We are seeing some delay  which would indicate a modestly high price  TER  Has Canpotex  the joint venture between PotashCorp  Agrium Inc   AGU NYSE  AGU TSX  and The Mosaic Co   MOS NYSE   priced itself out of the market  CD  I would not say that  Pricing is a bit of an art and supported by the discipline of the producers  These prices were obtained earlier in the year  so there is no reason not to come back and purchase at these prices again  In India  however  we are seeing some issues with government subsidies  India is favoring nitrogen over potash and phosphate right now in terms of subsidizing its farmers  That creates less demand for potash  In addition  there is inventory in the system  so pricing may have to come off a bit  but I do not think there is massive overpricing at this point  TER  What do you see as two or three trends that should generate investor interest in the fertilizer sector through 2015  CD  One trend is the reduced margin volatility for North American nitrogen producers  Urea and ammonia are typically more volatile and have lower margins than phosphate and potash  However  low gas prices in North America are allowing producers like Agrium to enjoy healthy  more stable margins because the prices are being set globally by the marginal producers in the Ukraine and Europe  who pay more for gas feedstock  We expect some softening of ammonia and urea prices and a modest increase in North American gas prices and therefore  margins should tighten  but we still expect a  150 250 ton margin in nitrogen over the next few years  This might help nitrogen valuation multiples expand  which makes this an interesting place for investors to be  Another trend is the creation of shareholder value by returning cash to investors  We expect both PotashCorp and Agrium to continue to invest for growth  but we definitely see more of a focus on yield  evidenced by numerous recent announcements of dividend increases  TER  Agrium boosted its dividend to  2 share last month  which sent the stock price up marginally in Toronto  Does a dividend of 2  really interest investors  CD  For investors who want exposure to the agriculture and fertilizer space  these names are proving to be defensive by paying some cash back to the shareholders  That is definitely helpful in a market where returns are difficult to get  These are cyclical stocks  so in the slower times you get a yield while retaining the potential for capital appreciation  But if you are a yield investor  there are definitely other sectors that pay higher dividends  TER  What are PotashCorp s and Mosaic s dividends  CD  PotashCorp s is  0 84 share  which is about a 2  yield  Mosaic s yield is just under 2   They are in line with each other  TER  You recently launched coverage of Agrium and PotashCorp  Why did you choose those two companies  CD  Dundee is well known for its coverage of resources  primarily mining and oil and gas  We are building out our fertilizer and agriculture platform  We chose to start with Canadian fertilizer producers for a couple of reasons  First  they play a major role in defining the market  especially PotashCorp  the market leader in the potash oligopoly  It is important to understand the market dynamics and the end markets if you are going to cover the junior mining companies  you gain that understanding by covering the market leaders  Second  we believe that many investors are looking for defensive investments today  Despite the cyclical headwinds  these producers can be good defensive investments in the fertilizer sector  We believe the long term growth profile for fertilizers is compelling and there is limited downside in our coverage companies at these stock prices  The producers are mature companies  subject to cyclicality and typically used as trading vehicles  obviously different from an investment in a junior miner  The producers are generally lower beta and lower risk  given their market capitalization  history of operation and cash generation profile  However  significant investment returns can be made in a short time period by timing the market properly  although returns are generally lower for the producers   Junior miners are generally higher beta and higher risk investments but can offer very high returns  The catch is that the outcome can be binary if companies do not secure financing due to factors such as low demand  technical issues and or weak capital and funding markets  We are looking at a number of potash and phosphate juniors and will be publishing more on them soon  We are generally expanding coverage of the fertilizer and agriculture sectors  so stay tuned  TER  Agrium has a lot of exposure to nitrogen  and it also has an activist investor  Can you tell us what that investor  JANA Partners LLC  is doing to boost Agrium s share price  CD  JANA is focused on increasing shareholder value  It has identified a number of areas where Agrium can increase the value of its stock and provide better returns for shareholders  Agrium is unique in that it is a diversified fertilizer producer and controls its own retail distribution  It has more downstream operations than the other fertilizer producers  Originally  JANA Partners talked about spinning out the retail business  the argument being that the retail division is undervalued and spinning it out would increase awareness and create shareholder value  We have seen less focus on that idea lately  The recent focus has been on increasing the dividend  cutting costs and improving working capital efficiency in the retail business  While Agrium had been focused on several of these initiatives  JANA is making the process more efficient  Agrium has reduced working capital as a percentage of sales and is providing more metrics to shareholders so they understand the business better and see the return more clearly  You can see the results in the share price  TER  It seems to be working  because your target price for Agrium is  118  which would be a 20  total return  Your target price on PotashCorp of Saskatchewan is  42  which would be a 5  total return  What other nitrogen heavy names are on your radar  CD  The two main nitrogen weighted names we follow are CF Industries Holdings Inc   CF NYSE   North America s largest nitrogen producer  and Yara International  YARIY OTCPK  in Norway  which is also the world s leading ammonia producer  TER  In a July 23 report  a chart showed that equity prices for the large potash producers were up year to date  with the exception of Intrepid Potash Inc   IPI NYSE   However  the prices for the junior names  the nonproducers  were all down  Why are the juniors uniformly underperforming  CD  Junior potash companies are suffering the same fate as most junior miners  It requires significant capital expense  capex  to build these projects  and they all carry financing risks  The market is applying a higher discount rate to junior miners across the board  given the challenging financing environment  TER  As the large potash producers see sizable cash flow increases  are any of them looking to invest in struggling juniors  CD  We do not see an immediate need to make investments  given that several of the major producers have just finished or are working on brownfield capacity expansion  which they can put into use over the next few years  But looking further out  potash producers are certainly motivated to maintain their oligopoly  Over time  we believe that some of the junior miners may benefit from investments  TER  Some of the juniors are below 50  of their 52 week highs  Is a takeover bid the only path to returning to those higher levels  CD  No  I do see a path forward other than a takeover bid  but in the near term they are at the mercy of the market  The junior potash miners are at 52 week lows for a couple of reasons  One is the financing environment  These companies need to make major capex investments  You see the financing risk reflected in their stock prices  You also see lower than expected demand in the potash space  which may be more of a timing issue  We expect the potash market to grow again  not at 5  but 3   which is a decent rate  TER  A handful of projects are approaching development  some are at the feasibility stage  Will the results of feasibility studies be catalysts for the share prices  CD  I doubt it  because at the end of the day  while the feasibility is a step forward  the projects still need either a strategic partner or an offtake to obtain bank financing  Once a feasibility study is complete  more remains to be done in terms of generating the financing if it has not already been secured  Having investors and partners is more of a driver for stock prices  TER  Could a junior miner develop a relationship with the Indian or Chinese government to develop its assets instead of waiting for a takeout by one of the majors  CD  China  India and other countries want to secure independent supplies of fertilizer  including potash to feed their people  This makes security of supply a key driver for junior potash companies  A lot of the juniors have been talking to companies and government officials in China and India  and we expect this to continue  Prospect Global Resources Inc   PGRX NASDAQ  recently announced a 10 year offtake agreement with a Chinese chemical company that we believe helped the company negotiate financing  The market reacted by boosting its stock 20   TER  Is it likely that a larger potash producing company would lock up some of the smaller assets to keep them away from the Indian or Chinese governments  thereby limiting supply  CD  We are not seeing much investment in juniors by major potash producers at this time  PotashCorp has a number of equity investments  but not in junior companies  Its investments are in Sociedad Qu mica y Minera de Chile S A   SQM NYSE  SQM B SSX  SQM A SSX   Israel Chemicals Ltd   ICL TASE   Arab Potash Co   APOT ASE  and Sinofert Holdings Ltd   297 SEHK   Yara  which also produces sulfate of potash  SOP   has a just under 20  interest in IC Potash  ICP TSX V  ICPTF OTCQX   which plans to be a primary producer of SOP by mining polyhalite  A subsidiary of India s Tata Chemicals Ltd   TATACHM770 BSE  invested about 26  in EPM Mining Ventures Inc   EPK TSX V   another potential SOP producer based in Utah  I think the major potash producers are focused on increasing their brownfield capacity  They still have lots to develop and it costs less than a greenfield development  TER  What catalysts should investors look for throughout the rest of 2012  CD  Catalysts for major potash producers would be increased demand from India  contracts being signed by both China and India and perhaps an increase in the contract size at a price close to today s prices  I think that would relieve some pressure in the market for these stocks and help drive the share price  That being said  we are maintaining a  neutral  on PotashCorp because we have yet to see any indication those catalysts will materialize in the near term  We continue to favor the North American nitrogen producers because  with less volatility in the margin  it is an interesting place for investors to be  You might see multiple expansions in that sector due to less volatility going forward  We like Agrium s ongoing focus on increasing shareholder value through efficiency and increased exposure of its retail business  which has historically been undervalued  We see the multiple expanding on that business and expect more upside there as well  TER  Carolyn  thank you for your time and insights  CD  Thank you   covers rare earths  industrial minerals and  more recently

149351,370867,CF,What The Market Wants  Continue The Consistency,opinion,The markets opened up yesterday on the heels of last week s positive developments in Europe  Unfortunately  Manufacturing ISM came in unexpectedly low at 49 7 versus an expected 52 2  which was down sharply from last month s 53 5  The market quickly gave up those early gains  the S P 500 and the Dow took a small loss while the NASDAQ held onto a small gain  A little help came minutes later as Construction Spending jumped from a loss of 0 6  last month to a gain of 0 9   The market had expected only a small gain of 0 2   Once everything was  fully digested   the market closed up about 0 50  for NASDAQ  up about 0 25  for S P 500  and down less than 0 1  for the Dow This will probably be a slow week with the holiday on Wednesday  following a half day today  Investors will be looking for signs of economic improvement in Friday s Employment Report  We also get ISM services and Initial Jobless Claims on Thursday Last week was  of course  quite positive due to the accord reached at the European Summit to directly assist ailing banks  and in addition  provide yet more capital  so banks can resume lending  As we had pointed out last week  the market was ready for some solution to our global economic malaise And indeed  money poured into undervalued stocks with Mid cap Value leading the way  up for the week at 3 23   Small caps were the best across all styles  up a solid 3   Mid cap Growth lagged  gaining only 1 51  The sectors were led up by Energy s sharp 4 1  rise  and Consumer Non Cyclicals and Basic Materials followed close behind with gains above 3   Technology lagged  gaining only 1 1  in part due to its stronger performance earlier in the year  and in part  due to a poor week from Apple  APPL  as modest gains on Friday pushed it just above the breakeven point for the week  So what s next   China continues to demonstrate slowing growth with poor figures released over this past weekend  If Europe does indeed carry through and implement the promised stimulus and the U S  continues to generate at least slow growth  the market should be ripe for picking up bargain stocks  It seems that the housing industry may have finally turned the corner  so construction growth would be at least one sector to study    As far as hedges go  you might take a look at using the iShares MSCI China Index ETF  MCHI   It has had fairly large cash outflows over the past month  Its largest concentration of assets is in the Financial Sector  Its P E seems moderate  but a steady decrease in economic growth within China would not bode well for this fund    4 Stock Ideas for this Market   This week s stocks were pulled from a GARP search in MyStockFinder    FreightCar America  Inc   RAIL  Industrials Twin Disc Inc   TWIN    Industrials CF Industries Holdings Inc   CF  Basic Materials DXPE Enterprises  Inc   DXPE  Industrials Full disclosure   The author does not hold positions in any of the stocks mentioned in this article ,2012-07-03,David Brown,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-market-wants:-continue-the-consistency-128372,128372

149387,370903,CF,Is the Kingdom at a Shale Crossroads ,opinion, The Wall Street maxim is that they never ring a bell at the top  However  on Jan  23  Chesapeake Energy did ring a bell at the bottom  The undoubted leader of the shale gas revolution announced that it would reduce drilling expenditures this year by more than 70 per cent  curtail its gas production by 8 per cent  cut land buying by  2 billion  and allow uneconomic gas leases to expire   John Dizzard  FT After buying production for over 20 years  hopefully I know the characteristics of great wells  flat decline curves  low operating costs  large production   and as you know  the shale plays have none of these  The herd mentality into the shale will eventually end possibly like the subprime mortgage did  In the meantime it is very difficult to sell any kind of prospect that is not a shale play   Anglo Geologist We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years    Applause    And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy   Experts believe this will support more than 600 000 jobs by the end of the decade   President ObamaI ve written several pieces on North American shale mania over the last year  but I have yet to write anything focusing on how this boom has impacted the region and more importantly what could happen if this boom turns to a bust  So  I figured now that Chesapeake has officially declared an end to the North American Shale Gas wildcat era now would be a good time to tackle this issue It s all about Saudi   Saudi is the big story in the region  and there are big changes taking place  The Kingdom s Petchem and Fertilizer companies have  for the better part of the last decade  been sitting on a license to print money  You can t buy a piece of Saudi Aramco  but you can buy Sabic and Safco and their subsidized   75 mm btu feedstock  Add in the volatility in North American Gas and booming demand from Asia  and it is no surprise that plants in North America couldn t compete and were shutting down while investment and capacity additions in the region were surging  As far as most global investors were concerned  it didn t get any easier than buying listed MENA petchem or fertilizer plays  You could just sit back and relax as Asian manufacturing growth and food demand rained money on your portfolio  I can remember spending hours on conference calls with hedge funds that wanted to talk about nothing other than potash  urea  ethylene  propylene  and phosphate  Then just when you thought you had it all figured out  along came shale gas  the crisis  quantitative easing  Opec quota cuts  and the Arab Spring to completely flip the script  So  let s begin by looking at Saudi Arabia  and the shifting petchem landscape they are facing The first thing any investor looking at the Saudi Petchem needs to ask himself is where did all the abundant cheap Ethane go  Looking at the market fundamentals two things jump out at you that should help answer this question    1  Supply is DownFeedstock shortages are now a serious concern in Saudi  and an increasing problem across the rest of the Gulf   Saudi s reduced oil production quotas mean the country must sacrifice associated gas production which has been the historical source of cheap ethane for crackers to defend oil prices  This is further complicated by the fact that the Kingdom s oil fields are getting more mature  and thus are no longer as rich in wet gas ethane   2  Demand is UpPopulation growth  rising domestic energy consumption  and increasing investment in regional petchem projects has been the norm  Not exactly a good combo when you are facing supply pressures  and Saudi has been hit particularly hard because of rising power investments and increased electricity demand  For example  this year Saudi power plants are expected to burn 1 2mln b d of crude to offset their lack of access to natural gas  But this is far from just a supply and demand story  It is also about   1  Domestic Politics Political pressures are leading to a surge in socially driven domestic government spending  and consequently reduced budgetary flexibility The Arab Spring has caused Saudi to ramp domestic spending to the point that it needs  85 oil to break even on its budget   This leaves little room for subsidies  and strengthens the case for shifting resources away from the export heavy petchem sector towards domestic price sensitive sectors 2  Strategic Goals  The Arab Spring has also led the Saudi government to shift focus more directly to job creation and the domestic economy and away from attracting investment in the petchem sector via providing a sizable global cost advantage  Simply proposing building another subsidized feedstock cracker won t cut it any more as Saudi is looking to climb the value food chain  and thus rationing resources for projects that assist in meeting these goals like more specialized chemicals plants that create higher value jobs 3  External Factors Shale Gas has had a profound impact on the petchem industry  Henry Hub Nat Gas is now trading closer to  2 5 mm btu which basically means the US has gone from a high cost marginal producer to the 2nd lowest cost marginal producer on the planet  The net result of all of this is that petchem capacity is coming online in North America  and the region is now attracting significant investment because of the current global cost advantage over naphtha based crackers  So  if the US is becoming more attractive place to build crackers and downstream complexes  the marginal benefit of providing subsidies to attract investment in your petrochemical sector diminishes  And that is only half of the story here  Despite the US significantly closing the cost gap with region  they have lost significant market share to MENA exporters in the key Chinese market  MENA and South East Asia with MENA leading the way at up 70   are the only regional exporters who have seen their polyethylene volumes into China significantly increase over the last two years  NAFTA  North East Asia  and Europe have all declined significantly with US PE exports to China falling by 50  over the last two years  So  despite the US becoming a much more attractive place to invest in petchem capacity  Saudi is still gaining market share in the most important export market for petchem producers because of strategic alliance with the Chinese  And this is in an environment in which China s Sinochem keeps investing in increasing production despite weakening global demand  falling imports  and decade low operating rates across most of the European based producers Put these three factors together and you understand why the petchem industry in region is in for some changes  The natural investment incentives that support subsidization in the industry are not there  the supply demand balance is not there  the political social agenda is not there  and the immediacy threat from shale is also presently not there thanks to close ties with the Chinese  Combine this with the fact that ethylene capacity in the United States is projected to grow by a third over the next 45 years  and you can see why the time may have come to take a second look at your models and the key assumptions that you are making  And this assuming the shale mania experiment does not spread to Europe and China So  what will Saudi do Well  considering the aforementioned factors  it should come as no surprise that Saudi Aramco is now focusing its attention on ramping nonassociated gas production  The Karan and Wasit projects are perfect examples of this strategy  Aramco needs to find more natural gas to meet rising demand  and this gas isn t going to come cheap  Breakeven costs on these sour gas projects should be north of  4mm btu  and thus are not exactly something for petchem investors to get excited about  Diversifying to other liquids like propane and naphtha is another way for a company like Sabic to handle the challenges of the road ahead  but that is still not going to solve the diminishing cost advantage and pressure on government oil export revenue problem And it is not like Saudi is the only country facing these challenges  Kuwait has feedstock issues  Qatar which is rich in gas currently has a moratorium in place on further development of its northern field  and Iran which is facing external sanctions just recently raised the prices on domestic feedstock to  2 mm btu  Now  back to Shale   With a river of ethane out there the petchem industry has gotten pretty excited about building out capacity to take advantage of the new found feedstock advantage  Debottlnecking announcements  and greenfield ventures are now all the rage  Chevron Phillips Chemical is building a new 1 5mln tonnes a year cracker in Texas  and adding 1mln tonnes yr of PE capacity  Formosa Plastics is also building  new cracker in Texas  There have also been capacity expansion announcements out of Westlake  Dow  Lyondell  and Williams  Shell is supposedly looking at  Marcellus cracker  There is even talk that South African based Sasol is completing a feasibility study for a  4billion worldscale cracker  Start adding everything up and you are talking a couple hundred million b d of new ethane capacity coming on line over the next several years  Will the demand be there for all of this  Or better yet  will the ethane  Add in gas cars  gas trucks  and the supposed end of dirty coal in North America and the demand projections go up even more  Then of course you have nitrogen fertilizer mania  Orascom Fertilizers   soon to be spun out of OCIC hopefully this gives IQCD some ideas on QFERT and QAFCO  is now looking to take advantage of some federal stimulus related cheap financing to make  1 3billion investment in a new nitrogen greenfield facility in Iowa  This comes on the heels of a 50  stake in an idled Texas based methanol ammonia plant  and a  3billion jv investment in a massive urea ammonia complex in Rio  When all this capacity comes online  Orascom will have gone from not producing any nitrogen fertilizer to being just behind Yara and on par with CF industries in global nitrogen fertilizer capacity in a couple of years  not a bad way to hedge your bets on egyptian feedstock prices  And I have not even gotten to the methanololefins technology Sabic and Sinochem plan on employing in their recently announced  5billion Trinidad and Tobago venture  Yes  the boom times are here again  and why shouldn t they be  If ethane remains as cheap as it is now or gets cheaper you are talking about a few  100 million dollars a year in margin advantage for North American cracker operators over naphtha based ethylene producers in Europe and Asia  Though one does wonder if that is going to hold up with gasoline demand in North America on the decline  and Chinese demand nowhere close to filling the void  Also  Shale Oil has much better economics than shale gas  and exploration in the space is still ramping  Consequently  domestic US Oil production is still increasing  and thus should continue exert downward pressure on oil prices  Basically  you need to ask yourself what happens to crude when the financials market stop fretting about Iran and Quantitative easing  Take a look at how far Bakken Shale oil prices at Clearbook plummeted earlier this year due to overproduction and inadequate transportation infrastructure  Maybe an oil price collapse is not such a farfetched scenario despite all the talk of  200 crude due to Iran related geopolitical factors  Though I am not as interested in that scenario as I am in the potential natural gas price shock that would follow a true shale gas bust The way I see it investors need to focus on three potential scenarios Scenario One Shale gas turn out to be more of a bubble than a panacea With Nat Gas prices now depressed producers no longer have the luxury of being able to sell forward future production at  6 7 per mm btu while they explore promote shale basins and play the flip leases land game  Instead  they are starting to curtail production at just about the exact time that US energy demand trends are starting to shift heavily in favor of natural gas  This combination of the two should lay the foundation for a rebound in natural gas prices  But will it just be a gradual rebound or could this turn into a natural gas price shock  If you come from the school of thought that believes once the capital investment vacuum that has been driving shale slows down  and well longterm fundamentals become the key driver of gas supply you favor the latter  With steep production declines being the norm for shale gas wells  and most noneconomic new well drilling activity ceasing without land economics and hedging providing support  prices could violently snap back  In this scenario  North American crackers and assorted downstream investments will end up being big losers at right about the time MENA natgas supply issues have become less of a problem  This of course would be great longterm news for MENA players as they would benefit from the shale boom and bust cycle as long as they have not been sucked into major North American investments Scenario Two Shale Gas is for real  and only getting started In this scenario demand picks up and production issues pressure supply  but you assume the production declines don t end up being nearly as severe and that significant new capacity can absorb the balance shift without a major price shock  You would also assume that shale gas gains momentum in other markets like China and Europe  The outcome of this will be that naphtha based plants are more likely to be exposed for weaker economics down the road  which really hasn t been a big problem so far   and many should be forced to close  This should by the way lead to reduced oil demand over time  and ultimately downward pressure on crude prices  At the same time  petchem prices should eventually start feeling the weight of huge capacity additions  and this will impact margins of producers globally with the lowest cost producers in the region bearing the brunt of this hit  This scenario also would not bode well for Russia as they would probably start to lose the firm grip they hold over European gas Scenario Three Shale Gas is for real  and Shale oil will be even better This is a worst case scenario for the Gulf because it would involve significant decline crude oil prices to go with much more competitive globally competitive petchem market  Basically  the region loses market share to the rest the world thanks to a shale energy renaissance that leads to major production spikes in traditional export markets  If this transpires  the whole thing won t sort itself out till crude falls far enough to cripple the shale producers  This would require OPEC to continue to pump at peak production as prices start to decline simply to ensure they can take back market share So  pick your poison for the next five years and let me know what you think  But no matter the scenario  there will be some clear winners  Jobs will created in the US  shale focused services companies will continue to perform well  midstream companies should benefit  and the E C players in North America should thrive ,2012-03-05,Akram's

149391,370907,CF,Oil And Natural Gas Ratio Explodes To 52 1,opinion,The ink on our last article is barely dry when its dire prediction actually came true 48 hours later  natural gas price dropping below  2  a level not seen in over a decade   Henry Hub natural gas front month futures declined to  1 982 per 1 000 cubic feet  mcf  on Wed  April 11  its lowest level since January 28  2002  when the price hit  1 91   Meanwhile  WTI crude oil rose by  1 68 to finish at  102 70 per barrel  Brent rude increased by 30 cents to finish at  120 18  The confluence of these price movements also brought the ratio between WTI and Henry Hub to a historical record high of 52 1  see chart below   while the ratio of Brent to Henry Hub is a jaw dropping 60 1   And we thought   also a historical high at the time  was parabolic  Crude oil and natural gas are both energy commodities and should logically have a high degree of correlation  Theoretically  based on an energy equivalent basis  crude oil and natural gas prices should have a 6 to 1 ratio  However  due to various market characteristics  the price of oil typically had traded 8 12x that of natural gas in the past 25 years or so  see chart above   That historical pattern has started to deteriorate since 2009 primarily due to the combination of rising domestic production from unconventional shale gas depressing price levels  while geopolitical events in the MENA region  Middle East   North Africa  adding fear premium to the global crude oil prices Natural gas lacks the global market structure like crude oil  and tends to be regionally based thus less impacted by external sources  Oil  on the other hand  is a commodity with global demand drivers  and along with gold  trades as an inflation hedge against a weakening US Dollar In most of Europe and Asia  the price of natural gas LNG is typically linked to crude oil under multiyear contracts So while the spike in Brent helped to boost natural gas markers elsewhere  with practically zero LNG export capacity in the U S   not even Fed s two rounds of quantitative easing could lift the languishing Henry Hub The chart below illustrates just how disconnected U S  natural gas price is vs  price levels in Asia  Europe andBrent crude oil  LNG  liquefied natural gas  is a relatively new technology that some believe has the potential to transform natural gas into a true global commodity   Unfortunately  as  Realistically  U S  gas cargos may have a hard time competing with other exporters such as Russia  Qatar and the up and comer Australia  in the Asian and European markets due to logistic disadvantage For U S  LNG exports to make economic sense  domestic gas price would need to stay low  with high enough international LNG prices  and if the LNG prices are still tied to crude oil  which could change depending on market development   then crude oil prices would have to remain elevated  While low prices are killing some of the natural gas producers  consumers will get a break from lower electricity costs Meanwhile  U S  natural gas trading at an 87  discount to Brent crude oil price is something even the oil industry appreciates  Valero  VLO   the world s largest independent refiner  said in a presentation this January that its refinery operations use up to 600 000 mmBtus day of natural gas at full utilization  Betting on  low U S  natural Gas prices for many years to come   Valero has several hydrogen and hydrocraker projects scheduled to complete by the end of 2012 to take full advantage of the low natural gas prices With the prospect of domestic natural gas prices remaining low and disconnected from global oil and gas prices for foreseeable future  U S based manufacturers of plastics  fertilizers and other products that use natural gas as a feedstock such as Dow Chemicals  DOW   Westlake Chemical Corp   WLK   Potash  POT  and CF Industries  CF  are set to benefit from cheap U S  natural gas as opposed to European and Asian competitors who do not ,2012-04-12,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-and-natural-gas-ratio-explodes-to-52:1-119855,119855
149392,370908,CF,Risk Management Is The Name Of The Game,opinion,Last week s broad market rally puts us at an interesting crossroads    While the primary bullish trend lines were clearly broken earlier in the month  the price action has rebounded   putting key indices back above important EMA support areas    But at the same time the market has been pushing higher  the fundamental data has been less than encouraging  The first quarter GDP report came in at 2 2  annual growth   well below expectations   as business investment showed particular weakness    This  bad news  was essentially shrugged off by equity traders  who saw the weakness as a great opportunity for the Fed to renew its promises of ample liquidity with essentially zero interest charges for the foreseeable future  Incidentally  Treasuries posted their 6th straight positive week despite a modestly more  hawkish  FOMC announcement this week    Midway through April  we had the chance to take a solid shot on some attractive R  reward to risk  bear scenarios  A few of these trades resulted in quick profits  And a few hit our tightened risk points during the rally last week    The net result is that our overall exposure has been whittled down quite a bit in response to the market environment  This type of situation is normal  There are times when you get the chance to step on the gas  and then quickly have to maneuver around new obstacles    Considering the cross currents that were introduced last week  the waters are a bit more muddy for short term trades  At the same time  there are a number of sectors and industries that look very promising  More data this week in the form of earnings announcements and economic reports should help to clarify the action   giving us opportunities to set up new trades along the way    Below are some of the area s we re watching this week Auto Makers Backfire Last week Ford Motor  F  reversed sharply lower after reporting earnings for the first quarter  While the headline numbers were good  Ford reported an operating loss in China  More importantly  management comments frightened investors as the picture is souring early in the second quarter    During the conference call  management stated that  April has been challenging    Considering the fact that the stock has already broken below a key support area  this bearish fundamental data didn t help the bull s case at all    After drifting higher early in the week  Ford reversed sharply   setting up a great bearish continuation pattern    The bearish environment is confirmed by the price action in General Motors  GM   as well as key supplier Goodyear Tire   Rubber  GT   Goodyear expects weakening volume as the company adopts a strategy to focus on premium tires   and investors interpret this to mean the company is finding less demand for its  standard  lines  Private Equity Capitalizing on Opportunity   On the bullish side of the ledger  things are looking better for several private equity companies    Last week  KKR   Co   KKR  announced  economic earnings  of 99 cents   well above estimates for 73 cents per share  The stock had a decent week  and is rebounding off a key support area  after bottoming in 2010     It s interesting to note that the company has been much less aggressive on the acquisition side  KKR only made 2 major purchases in the first quarter   and is likely to see more profits from distribution of assets  IPO transactions  or other selling transactions  When these events occur  it allows the PE firms to book incentive allocations   obviously good news for KKR shareholders    An interesting note from the earnings presentation is that KKR made a  196 million shopping mall acquisition last week  Commercial real estate  particularly retail based  has been fairing well over the last several quarters  Simon Property Group  SPG  has been trending sharply higher and had a blowout earnings announcement last week as well    Picking up exposure to strong retail properties should be a cash flow positive proposition for KKR in the short run  with plenty of opportunity for capital gains if and when they decide to book profits on the property    Both KKR and Fortress Investment Group  FIG  look like strong bullish candidates  provided the patterns remain intact and the overall equity environment doesn t fall apart  Fertilizer Stocks Back on the Radar   We have taken a step back from fertilizer stocks after the group faded into the end of the year  But the recent action for the group has been much more encouraging  and last week CF Industries  CF  broke to a new high    A warm spring across the northern hemisphere has led to a record planting season  This of course leads to stronger demand for fertilizer   and inventories are being drawn down    During the quarterly earnings call  Mosaic Co   MOS  management stated that both domestic and international markets had strengthened significantly   comments which helped boost investor sentiment for the group    Production activity is picking up for the group  and even larger  conglomerates like BHP Billiton  BHP  and VALE Sa   VALE  are exploring ways to boost their exposure to the area  Earnings season is still in full swing and there are plenty of data points both on an individual stock level as well as reports that could move entire sectors or asset classes Risk management is the name of the game this week  We re managing our exposure carefully while still keeping an open mind for potential entries in attractive sectors
