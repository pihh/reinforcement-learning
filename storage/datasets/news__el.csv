3947,225462,EL,Cosmetics Industry Outlook Glows On Travel Retail  High Demand,opinion,The Zacks industry includes providers of beauty and personal care products  Players in the industry mainly manufacture and market skin care  fragrance  makeup and hair care products  Many firms in the space market via sales representatives  whereas some sell their products through retailers  independent and chain drug stores and pharmacies  upscale perfumeries  department stores and beauty salons  among others Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Strength in travel retail channel is a major tailwind for players in the cosmetic industry as beauty and fragrance account for a sizeable part of travel retail sales  Markedly  sales of these products have been rising on increased travel  especially around Asia Pacific and China  We note that the travel retail platform helps enhance brand awareness and acceptance among customers globally  Rising demand for skincare products  which constitute a considerable proportion of cosmetic sales  is a major driver  Additionally  the industry players are set to benefit from favorable haircare product sales and improving trends in makeup and fragrance businesses  Cosmetic players are focused on making the most of these trends through constant innovation  launches  buyouts and strengthening of digital operations  However  these entail high costs  Rising health concerns and inputs in the preparation of cosmetic products have drawn the attention of the FDA on cosmetic players  which were otherwise self regulated for quite some time  Additionally  availability of cheaper alternatives gives rise to stiff competition in the luxury segment Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Cosmetics industry is housed within the

Bottom LineProspects in the cosmetics space appear bright  given the strength in travel retail and digital operations along with burgeoning skincare products demand  Apart from this  efforts to empower sales leaders through improved training and technological enhancements will likely work in favor of most cosmetics companies  However  stiff competition and escalating costs related to product

136355,357870,EL,Hong Kong unrest  stronger dollar weigh on Estee Lauder s FY forecast,news,"By Soundarya J and Praveen Paramasivam
 Reuters     Estee Lauder  Cos Inc  N EL  cut its full year profit forecast on Thursday as it expects to take a hit from the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong and a stronger dollar  taking the sheen off its better than expected results and sending its shares down 5  
Luxury goods companies and retailers have felt the pinch from months of pro democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have forced some shops to close temporarily  and kept tourists away from one of the world s most vibrant shopping destinations 
The cosmetics maker said net sales from Hong Kong  which makes up just under 4  of its global business  had fallen 20  in the first quarter 
 Hong Kong has been difficult   said Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda on an earnings call with analysts  adding that there was no sign of improvement in the business there to date 
Estee Lauder also said it was mindful of  among other risks  moderating growth in China from recent levels  where its sales have been growing in double digits on booming demand for high end luxury products from affluent Chinese consumers 
 Given the fact that there are global macro slowdowns  even though we haven t  in fact  seen it in China and haven t seen it affect our Asia business in general     it certainly could happen   Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said 
The company said it expects 2020 adjusted profit between  5 85 and  5 93 per share  down from a prior range of  5 90 to  5 98 
Estee Lauder  which generates 68  of revenue from Asia Pacific  Europe  the Middle East and Africa market  said the strong dollar would hit its earnings by 5 cents per share 
Another sore spot for the M A C brand owner was its Americas business  which is being pressured by weaker customer traffic at brick and mortar stores as customers shift to online shopping and buying at specialty beauty shops 
 U S  performance will remain a concern and focus for investors as market has decelerated after Estee Lauder had talked of sequential improvement in Q4   Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said 
Sales in the U S  market fell 6   while operating income dropped 25   In contrast  Asia Pacific region that accounts for a quarter of total sales rose 24  in the quarter 
Overall  net sales climbed 11  to  3 90 billion on the strength of its skin care brands like La Mer 
Excluding items  Estee Lauder earned  1 68 per share 
Analysts on average had expected revenue of  3 85 billion and adjusted profit of  1 60 per share  according to IBES data from Refinitiv ",2019-10-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hong-kong-unrest-stronger-dollar-weigh-on-estee-lauders-fy-forecast-2008969,2008969

Luxury goods makers and beauty firms are increasingly shifting sales online  but many are also sprucing up stores and trying to turn them into day trip worthy destinations to lure shoppers who are turning away from malls and other centers 
Lancome  one of the biggest brands of French cosmetics  group L Oreal  already sells its creams and make up though airport retailers  department stores and other networks  including 50 freestanding stores in China 
It is launching a 300 square meter flagship store on Paris  Champs Elysee avenue  a major tourist magnet  The concept  which includes video gimmicks on interactive walls  mirrors similar moves by other fashion or sporting brands  Lancome CEO Francoise Lehmann said 
A second flagship store is planned for Beijing in 2020  Lehmann declined to give financial details 
Groups like Louis Vuitton owner LVMH  PA LVMH  are also spending on jazzed up retail ventures   the French conglomerate is about to relaunch a major department store on the banks of the Seine river   even as some historic peers like Barneys in New York struggle and are having to slim down 
Pricier luxury cosmetics have proved a sweet spot for beauty firms like L Oreal and U S  rival  Estee Lauder   N EL  in recent quarters  driven by thriving demand from Chinese consumers and despite competition from start up make up brands 
 Young Chinese women are drawn very early on to skincare products   Lehmann said  adding that even among 20 to 35 year olds  rejuvenating treatments were particularly popular ",2019-12-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/loreals-lancome-beefs-up-stores-as-luxury-cosmetics-take-off-2033845,2033845

136360,357875,EL,With lipsticks  Hermes branches into competitive cosmetics world,news,"PARIS  Reuters    France s Hermes  PA HRMS  said on Wednesday it would start selling make up from March  as the brand best known for its pricey Birkin handbags branches into a competitive beauty industry where its luxury rivals include Chanel 
Hermes  which already sells perfumes  will make its first foray into cosmetics with lipsticks  and will add other products over time 
The roll out adds more accessible ranges to a company known for bags that can sell for over  10 000  while cosmetics are often a highly profitable sideline for fashion firms 
High end make up and skincare products have outperformed lower end ranges at beauty firms like L Oreal or  Estee Lauder   NYSE EL  in recent years  thanks in part to buoyant Chinese demand for branded wares  anti ageing treatments and other luxury creams 
But make up sales are starting to slow globally and particularly in the United States  several firms in the sector have noted  while competition from upstart brands has risen  with celebrities like singer Lady Gaga also entering the fray 
Prices for Hermes  lipsticks will start at 62 euros for one of the refillable lacquer tubes  developed in house and made at a partner factory  Many fashion labels like Italy s Armani or Kering owned Gucci tend to contract out their entire cosmetics production under license to the likes of L Oreal or Coty 
Originally a saddle maker  Hermes   which ranks just behind Gucci  privately owned Chanel and LVMH s  PA LVMH  Louis Vuitton as one of the biggest luxury brands in the world by sales   makes most of its money from leather accessories

136381,357896,EL,U S  Stock Futures Bounce  Dow on Track for Triple Digit Gains,news,"Investing com   U S  stock futures pointed to a higher open on Monday  with Dow futures surging more than 200 points after the U S  administration downplayed concerns over the risk of a recession  insisting its trade war with China was doing no damage to the U S  economy 
The blue chip Dow futures gained 247 points  or 0 9  by 06 49 AM ET  10 49 GMT   S P 500 futures rose 27 points  or 0 9   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 81 points  or 1 08  
The gains came after Wall Street ended last week in a more upbeat mood  buoyed by a rebound in bond yields  which eased fears over the economic outlook 
But investors were continuing to keep a wary eye on economic data and developments in the Sino U S  trade war 
On Sunday  President Donald Trump dismissed concerns over the possibility of a U S  recession 
 I don t think we re having a recession   Trump said   We re doing tremendously well  Our consumers are rich  I gave a tremendous tax cut and they re loaded up with money  
His comments came after the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index hit its lowest level in seven months on Friday 
Trump was less optimistic than his aides on striking a trade deal with China  saying that while he believed China was ready to come to an agreement   I m not ready to make a deal yet  
He hinted that the White House would like to see Beijing resolve ongoing protests in Hong Kong first 
Markets were also awaiting a decision expected to arrive later Monday over whether the government will allow Huawei Technologies to buy supplies from U S  firms 
Several media outlets reported that the U S  Commerce Department will grant a  temporary general license  that will allow business to continue for another 90 days  However  Trump appeared to contradict that by saying that he didn t want U S  companies to deal with Huawei at all  citing national security concerns 
On a light day for economic data  investors were looking ahead to earnings reports from   Estee Lauder    NYSE EL   the parent company for MAC  Clinique  Bobbi Brown  Smashbox and other premium cosmetics brands along with Chinese search engine giant Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU

136407,357922,EL,In Asia  nascent men s make up market starts drawing big brands,news,"By Haejin Choi  Sarah White and Sam Nussey SEOUL PARIS TOKYO  Reuters    From an eye shadow that opens with the flick of a thumb  Zippo style  to a barely there foundation in subtle blue gray packaging  men s make up is getting a makeover as manufacturers bid to take it more mainstream  France s Chanel and Japan s Pola Orbis are among firms launching new ranges to exploit signs of rising demand for cosmetics among men  especially in Asia  betting the tide is finally turning in a segment that has long underwhelmed  Beyond showbusiness circles or the limited realm of beauty bloggers  the brands have other clients   such as image conscious executives   in their sights  as they emphasize the undetectable aspects of some products   Giving off a sense of cleanliness is becoming a kind of business skill   said Akira Gogo  president of Pola Orbis subsidiary Acro  which launched a men s make up range in September that includes foundation in 15 different skin tones given names like  Crispin  or  Joaquin    With some previous experiments in this field flopping  and dominant players such as France s L Oreal on the fence  it s a gamble the companies are reticent to hype up too much    We don t expect to see sales suddenly jump   we re trying to create a new culture   Gogo added   But an increasingly receptive audience in markets such as South Korea   where wildly popular  K pop  boy bands and their cute  flawless looks have helped redefine ideas of the comely male   points to growing potential for this niche  That is partly down to consumers such as Lee Ho June  a 28 year old who runs his own company as a fashion designer  He says he draws the line at a full face of make up  unlike some acquaintances who paint their eyebrows  but has got used to using tinted moisturisers like BB creams   and visiting beauty stores with growing men s counters    For me as a guy  it had been embarrassing and awkward to walk into a cosmetics shop   Ho June said  as he browsed with a female friend in downtown Seoul   Now I enter a shop without hesitation   Asia s male grooming market is still a relative minnow  accounting for under a fifth of the  49 5 billion industry globally in 2017  according to data from market research firm Euromonitor  Yet while business in other regions revolves around shaving products and deodorants  Asia already punches above its weight in men s skincare  accounting for more than 60 percent of worldwide sales in one of the industry s fastest growing segments   MEN S NEEDS Most cosmetics makers have made  at most  only tentative steps into men s make up  L Oreal  which featured a male model for the first time in a 2016 advertising campaign for a foundation  makes BB creams for men  So does  Estee Lauder   NYSE EL   under its male Lab Series brand  which recently also launched a colour correcting moisturizer meant to mimic the effect of a photo filter   But the U S  company s Tom Ford ranges are among the only world famous names in male make up  Some others  including a line attempted in 2008 by French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier  were discontinued   Tom Ford Beauty  which sells lipstick hues with names like  Alistair  and  Scott   and men s mud masks for  60  declined to comment on its sales progress since entering the space in 2012  Neither Chanel nor Acro disclosed how much they d invested in the launches  But the new entrants  with products priced at up to  75 for a foundation in Chanel s case  are banking that men will become more exacting as they develop beauty regimens  seeking out specific textures to cover their larger pores  for instance  Chanel  known for its No 5 perfume and fashion ranges  included matt lip balms and eyebrow pencils in shades such as gray in its new men s make up line called  Boy    We are convinced that targeting men s specific needs will lead the industry to real innovation in application techniques  in new products with multiple uses  and new formats   Chanel said in emailed comments   Its range had already attracted some interest at a Chanel store in Seoul in November  though male customers were scarce    It can be a great gift for men   said Oh Min Ji  29  who said she shared some of her make up with her younger brother but had found the idea of giving him women s products  awkward   Acro has sought to make the products accessible to men by putting the accent on their application   Chunky foundation bars can be applied with motions similar to using an electric razor  while the shape of others recall an e cigarette than can be easily carried in a jacket pocket  KOREA FIRST  CHINA KEY In South Korea  spending per head on men s skincare   seen as a small leap away from using concealers and make up   already beats other countries hands down  with consumers splurging more than 10 times more than their U S  or French peers  according to Euromonitor   The pressure to look youthful is very  very strong in South Korea  In jobs  you have to look like a 20 year old   but have 20 years  experience   said Michael Nolte  creative director of cosmetics trend forecasting company BeautyStreams   It s a cultural thing too  boyish good looks are in   That brings opportunities  but also some hurdles  for the brands in a fiercely innovative and competitive local cosmetics market where non male specific make up is already becoming popular with men  In the eight months to August  South Korea s biggest online shopping site Gmarket recorded a 130 percent jump from a year earlier in the sale of cosmetics to male customers  including mascara and lip tint  Chanel brought out its  Boy  range in South Korea in September  and plans to land it in Asian  U S  and British stores in 2019  Acro has initially focused on stores and online sales in Japan  but sees South Korea and Thailand as potential entry points to the broader Asia market  which it plans to enter next year   A key test for contenders in men s make up would be to eventually crack China       Its overall beauty market was worth an estimated 39 billion euros   44 35 billion  in 2018 and is expected to more than double by 2030  according to L Oreal forecasts  Signs of interest from male shoppers are already appearing   JD com  China s No  2 e commerce company  said the number of male consumers buying make up in the first 17 days of a special sale period in June this year had jumped 61 percent from a year earlier  Popular skincare brands included LVMH s Dior and Procter   Gamble s Japanese label SK II   It s really starting to change   said Shanghai based TreeTree Wu  26  a male cosmetics blogger with almost 270 000 followers on Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo  and

136433,357948,EL,Coronavirus Scare Hits Markets  3 Stocks To Buy The Dip,opinion,"Concerns over the outbreak of a newly detected virus have kept investors on tenterhooks recently  As news of the Chinese Coronavirus made headlines earlier this week upon being detected in a U S  citizen  the panic induced among authorities  passengers and investors led to a plunge in travel  and luxury related stocks 
Considering the current scenario  one could take a look at some stocks that suffered from the health hazard but bear strong fundamentals  This implies that eventually their share prices will go up  In fact  the decline in their recent price performance makes them all the more lucrative 
U S  Equities Plunge on Potential Pandemic
U S  benchmark indexes took a dip on Jan 21  retracting from record highs witnessed last week  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  NASDAQ Composite and the broader S P 500 declined 0 5   0 2  and 0 3   respectively  The reason behind this dip was none other than fears of a potential Coronavirus pandemic  which has resulted in 6 deaths and more than 300 infected in China 
Wall Street took the road south after the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the first case of the new Chinese disease within the United States 
The United States is the fifth country to report the Coronavirus after China  Thailand  Japan and South Korea  An American who returned from a trip to central China was diagnosed with the virus last week 
Stocks Offering Great Entry Points Right Now
The panic has resulted in travelers restraining their plans  as several airports around the globe raised the extent of their biosecurity screenings of those from the Asian country  As a result  stocks of airlines  hotels and resorts were hit hard 
Airlines such as United Airlines Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ UAL    Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   and American Airlines Group Inc    NASDAQ AAL    and cruise companies such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd    NYSE RCL   and Carnival Corporation   Plc   NYSE CCL   were among those stocks that took a beating on Jan 21 because of the Coronavirus scare  In fact  marketers of luxury goods also felt the heat as passengers curtailed their plans to travel 
The affected stocks were those with maximum exposure to the Asian region  since these companies are mostly dependent on spending by Chinese tourists  In addition  as the influx of tourists expected at this time of the year thins  the Chinese New Year being this week   travel  and luxury related stocks could decline further 
Bright Prospects for Travel and Luxury Stocks 
Airline stocks may not have had a blockbuster 2019  but these stocks have a sunnier picture this year  thanks to a strong U S  economy  a truce in U S  China trade war and low oil prices  In addition  according to the International Air Transport Association  IATA   profitability for the airline industry this year is expected to be  29 3 billion 
The outlook for the top line is also better at  872 billion  which indicates 4  growth from 2019  Passenger traffic and capacity in 2020 are also expected to increase 4 1  and 4 7   respectively 
Secondly  this plunge in stocks of hotels  resorts  casinos  cruises and luxury goods could be short lived  After all  sales of luxury products thrive on the power of individual branding  which could pick up soon enough  In addition  the number of people opting for a holiday is expected to reach normalcy  as fears of the new pandemic subside

136442,357957,EL,Beauty contest  China make up brands rein in South Korea rivals,news,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Adam Jourdan SEOUL SHANGHAI Reuters    As a diplomatic spat between Beijing and Seoul raged this year  many South Koreans felt decidedly unwelcome in China  South Korean businesses were shunned  K pop concerts were canceled and tourist trade dried up  But one group of South Koreans have been very much in demand  the executives and employees of South Korea s cosmetics companies  who are being lured by Chinese rivals as a battle for China s huge beauty market heats up   Chinese make up brands including Jala  Proya  603605 SS  and Suhu   which have long trailed Korean rivals in terms of quality   are hiring South Korean executives as well as spending up on research and buying overseas firms  industry executives and headhunters say   The moves seem to be helping   Chinese brands  which compete with Korea names from top rated Amorepacific  KS 002790  to nimble budget makers such as Clio  KQ 237880   are gaining market share in the mid range and premium cosmetics sector where South Korea has traditionally had strength in China  While Chinese companies have been gaining ground for some time  the trend appears to have accelerated this year after Seoul s decision to install a U S  anti missile system against Beijing s wishes sparked a backlash against Korean companies   At stake is a bigger chunk of China s  50 2 billion beauty and personal care market  which research firm Euromonitor projects will grow to  61 9 billion by 2020  Jason Yu  Shanghai based General Manager of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel  said mid tier or  masstige  Korean brands were most exposed to Chinese brands improving their offering  High end brands from France s L Oreal  PA OREP  and Japan s Shiseido  T 4911  tended to attract wealthier buyers   In terms of the price position  they will be more in direct competition with the emerging Chinese brands who are moving up the price ladder   said Yu  adding Chinese firms were  catching up very fast   HIRING SPREE There are signs that recent diplomatic tensions have played into the hands of local Chinese brands in their battle with Korean rivals  Amorepacific s sales fell 8 percent in the January to September period from a year earlier  while operating profit skidded 30 percent  Smaller  budget makers were hit harder  with Clio s operating profit falling nearly 70 percent  While some Chinese make up brands use South Korean stars or highlight Korean links  others are playing up Chinese elements such as using traditional medicine ingredients or use slogans about suiting Chinese skin  Zoe Zhuang  24  an engineer in Nanjing  said she used to use cushion foundations and eye pencils from South Korea s Etude brand  She now uses more Chinese to  support local brands   she said  without referring to the dispute over the THAAD missile system    I actually don t think Chinese makeup is that good yet  there is plenty of room for improvement   she said  Chinese cosmetics firms have been trying to close the quality gap by aggressively targeting South Korean executives     Chinese cosmetics brands  are recruiting Koreans in almost all areas  including brand managers  packaging design  store interiors  purchasing and marketing   Choi Sun hee  head of South Korean recruiting firm HR Biz Korea  told Reuters  Some Chinese brands are willing to offer 50 percent higher wages  help with rents and flights home to woo Korean workers  Choi added  Guangzhou based Suhu plans to double the number of its South Korean employees to 40  Choi said  It recently hired an executive from Korea s Nature Republic to oversee the recent launch of its Rojank brand  he added  Suhu declined to comment   Chinese brand Proya  which owns the Uzero and Cats   Roses brands  hired South Korean Kim Hoi joon from Clio in 2014 to launch its Hapsode brand  Kim told Reuters  Another former Amorepacific official said Kim had lured him to Proya last year with a salary hike of about 50 percent  He said he was one of over 10 Korean employees hired by Proya  Proya declined to comment  Meanwhile  Jala  one of China s leading cosmetics firms  hired a Korean executive earlier this year to revamp its mainstay Chando brand  two people familiar with the matter told Reuters   Jala also hired the former head of Amorepacific s Etude brand  Kim Dong young  they added  Kim  reached by phone  confirmed he had been working at Jala for about a year  but declined to comment further  Jala s press office was not available for comment   The approach is not limited to cosmetics  Chinese firms from carmakers to flatscreen producers to smartphone vendors have recently opened up more to hiring foreign talent to help them gain a competitive edge  often taking market share from South Korean rivals as they move up the value chain and their industries mature  But Korean brands aren t going down without a fight  Amorepacific said it was working with experts in seven Chinese cities to study local skin characteristics and develop products for the local market

It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if EL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this beauty products company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For EL  shares are up 3 38  over the past week while the Zacks Cosmetics industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 68  compares favorably with the industry s 0 12  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Estee Lauder have risen 16 19   and are up 73 75  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 11 45  and 29 03   respectively 
Investors should also take note of EL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  EL is averaging 1 172 894 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with EL 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EL s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 96 to  5 98 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that EL is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Estee Lauder on your short list ",2020-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-estee-lauder-el-200499718,200499718

136548,358063,EL,Deckers  DECK  Up 34  In A Year  Will Momentum Sustain ,opinion,Shares of Deckers Outdoor Corporation   NYSE DECK   have outperformed the industry in the past one year  Notably  shares of this Goleta  CA based company have gained approximately 34  in the aforementioned time frame compared with the  s growth of 10 5   Also  the stock has comfortably outperformed the  sector that has decreased 5 3  and the S P 500 Index that grew 0 3  in the said time frame The company has been benefiting from its focus on expanding brand assortments  introducing more innovative line of products  targeting consumers digitally through marketing and sturdy e commerce along with optimizing omni channel distribution Backed by these tailwinds  the company commenced fiscal 2020 on a strong note  wherein both the top line and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year  Results gained from earlier delivery of wholesale and distributor shipments in the UGG brand and strong performance across HOKA ONE ONE brand  Consequently  management raised fiscal 2020 view For fiscal 2020  net sales are estimated in the band of  2 100  2 125 billion  which indicate year over year growth of about 4 5   The company had earlier guided net sales between  2 095 billion and  2 120 billion for fiscal 2020 Let s delve deeper into the factors that have been driving this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Factors Narrating Deckers  Growth PotentialDeckers is focusing on product and marketing strategies that are more skewed toward customers and in this respect  it is implementing customer relationship management software and concentrating on loyalty program  Moreover  the company is focusing on expanding its product categories according to the customer purchasing trends  In order to capture incremental sales and margins  it is selling directly to wholesale customers The company is constantly developing its e commerce portal to capture incremental sales  Deckers has made substantial investments to strengthen its online presence and improve shopping experience for its customers  Its focus on expanding programs   Retail Inventory Online  Infinite UGG  Buy Online  Return In Store  and Click and Collect   to enhance customers  shopping experience is an added positive Apart from these  the company is undertaking efforts to bolster its portfolio  It is making marketing investments to build brand awareness of HOKA ONE ONE and UGG Men s and UGG Women s non core category  Impressive performance across HOKA ONE ONE and Koolaburra brands aided results  The first quarter fiscal 2020 results also gained from earlier delivery of wholesale and distributor shipments in the UGG brand and strong performance across HOKA ONE ONE brand driven by the launch of Carbon X Deckers now anticipates second quarter net sales in the range of  515  525 million  In the year ago period  the company had reported  501 9 million net sales  Management expects revenues from HOKA ONE ONE brand to increase in the high 30  range for the year Near Term HeadwindsDeckers is grappling with falling sales from the Sanuk Brand  During the first quarter of fiscal 2020  net sales from the Sanuk brand came in at  18 7 million  down 23 5  year over year  Sanuk brand sales came in about  3 million below management s expectation mainly due to sluggishness in the yoga sling franchise  Further  management expects reductions in the Sanuk domestic wholesale business on account of the decision to exit the warehouse channel  Though the move is likely to impact fiscal 2020 revenue adversely  it will help the brand focus on other underpenetrated channels Although full year sales are anticipated to increase  margins are likely to be soft and earnings are expected to fall  Management expects gross margin for fiscal 2020 to be 50 5   The company reported 51 5  gross margin in fiscal 2019  Also  operating margin is envisioned to be in the range of 14 5   Operating margin in fiscal 2019 was 16 2  The company envisions fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings between  8 40 and  8 60 per share  We note that it had delivered adjusted earnings of  8 84 per share in fiscal 2019  For the second quarter  management forecasts adjusted earnings of  2 15  2 25 per share  The company had reported earnings of  2 38 per share in the prior year period Bottom LineAlthough weakness in the Sanuk Brand has been eclipsing the company s performance  we expect solid yields from UGG and HOKA ONE ONE brands along with other efforts to offset the aforementioned hurdles and help drive

136566,358081,EL,China bets on duty free paradise to keep luxury spenders at home,news,"By Farah Master
SANYA  China  Reuters    China s efforts to lift local consumption  spur domestic tourism and keep within its borders citizens that splurge in Milan or Seoul have spawned a duty free paradise on the southern island of Hainan that it hopes will satisfy a lust for luxury 
Firms such as the owner of the world s biggest duty free shopping center  China International Travel Service Corp Ltd  CITS    are capitalizing on a relaxation of duty free spending restrictions in February  with HNA Group Co Ltd reporting a 160 percent surge in sales 
Government initiatives  including 19 more duty free shops nationwide  come as sales of the types of luxury goods that line duty free shelves fell 2 percent last year  Market watchers pin the blame on a campaign against demonstrations of wealth among public officials  as well as a slowdown in economic growth 
As things stand  the Chinese buy close to 80 percent of their luxury goods abroad in cities such as Paris  London and Tokyo  Bain Consultancy estimated 
 Whether it is  Burberry  or  Richemont  recently  many brands in the space have noted that the future of luxury demand will be about the Chinese and incrementally at home   said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in Hong Kong  who recommends buying CITS shares 
LESS CHOICE
In Hainan  which is closer to Hanoi than Beijing  duty free shops offering products priced as much as 30 percent less than the mainland have been operating since 2011  under a trial program aimed at developing the island as a tourist destination 
Customers could initially only buy up to 8 000 yuan   1 220  worth of duty free goods  twice a year  From Feb  1  they have been able to make purchases any time of the year provided the total does not exceed 16 000 yuan  At the same time  stores have also been able to sell goods online for collection at airports 
In Hainan s provincial capital Haikou in the north of the island  HNA s duty free sales have since rocketed 
In the island s city of Sanya  state controlled CITS opened the country s first duty free shopping center in 2014  The skylit  flower shaped edifice is about nine soccer pitches in size and filled with shops stocking over 300 brands including from Burberry Group PLC  L BRBY  and Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA  S CFR   as well as goods such as baby formula 
 It s definitely much cheaper   said 20 something handbag shopper Zhang Pei Pei   But the choice of products is less  
CITS declined to comment when contacted by Reuters 
HOTEL RUSH
Hainan s balmy climate and over 60 beaches is a draw for developers  with Sanya on the island s southern tip dotted with luxurious resorts completed or under construction  That city   three times the size of Singapore   has over 1 000 hotels with 30 more due to open in its Haitang Bay area in the coming years 
One of those is the  1 7 billion Alantis project of Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd  HK 0656  and the owner of South Africa s Sun City casino resort  Sol Kerzner 
 Fosun is optimistic in the future development of Sanya   the company said in an email to Reuters 
Near the capital Haikou  property and aviation conglomerate HNA plans to develop a deep water port  international sports stadium and motor racing circuit  as well as an artificial isle similar to Dubai s Palm Islands 
Its aim is to become the country s first duty free retail brand  HNA said in emailed comments 
COSMETIC
But for all the glamor  there are plenty of Chinese ready to spend holiday money on products that are more or less in reach on a daily basis 
On one weekday afternoon in CITS  mall  queues snaked out of beauty stores from Chanel SA   Estee Lauder  Companies Inc  N EL  and L Oreal SA  PA OREP   while the outlets of upmarket watchmakers appeared near empty 
 I just want to buy cosmetics   said He  a 30 something from southwestern mainland city of Chongqing  who did not provide her surname   For other things like bags  I will just take a look  
In agreement was Huang Cheng  a 26 year old engineering student from Shanxi province in northern China 
 We don t really want to buy the big brands   he said  gesturing to the empty watch shops   The main reason is just to buy daily necessities  
Hong Kong based CLSA analyst Aaron Fischer said the limited number of duty free zones is unlikely to materially boost domestic spending on luxury goods 
He also said price was not the only reason for shopping outside of China  Buying luxury goods in the country of origin gives  a greater feeling of satisfaction   he said ",2016-05-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china-bets-on-duty-free-paradise-to-keep-luxury-spenders-at-home-405230,405230
136572,358087,EL,Will Productivity Efforts Drive PepsiCo s  PEP  Q3 Earnings ,opinion,PepsiCo  Inc    NASDAQ PEP   is set to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 3  before market open  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 4  Notably  PepsiCo has reported positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 14 quarters and sales beat in eight of the last 10 quarters  Its earnings beat estimates by average of 2 7  in trailing four quarters Pepsico  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings is pegged at  1 50  implying a 5 7  decline from the year earlier quarter s reported figure  Notably  the consensus mark remained unchanged over the past 30 days  For quarterly revenues  the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  16 97 billion  suggesting 2 9  growth from the prior year quarter s reported figure Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement Factors at PlayPepsiCo s robust surprise trend is mainly attributable to gains in all six operating segments along with strength in product and geographic portfolios  and progress on productivity targets  Growth across segments is also bolstering the company s organic revenues  Backed by these trends  the company is likely to continue with its impressive top  and bottom line performance in the to be reported quarter The company s fundamental strength is evident from its solid brand portfolio  product innovation and the strong snacks business  PepsiCo is focused on driving efficiency and effectiveness by lowering costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities  The company now estimates generating productivity savings of at least  1 billion annually through 2023  This  in turn  is likely to boost margins and the bottom line These productivity and cost saving efforts are likely to help the company further ease  synchronize and automate processes  re engineer the go to market and information systems  simplify the organization  and optimize its manufacturing and supply chain footprint  As part of these restructuring actions  the company estimates incurring pre tax charges of nearly  2 5 billion through 2023  with the cash portion of nearly  1 6 billion   Savings from the productivity and restructuring plans will boost revenues and margins over the long run Further  PepsiCo has the competitive advantage of selling both snacks and beverages  which are complementary food categories  The company s complementary snacks portfolio results in cost leverage  capability sharing  cross category promotions and other commercial benefits  The Snacking segment is expected to continue delivering strong sales and profits  owing to the rising demand for savory snacks Furthermore  PepsiCo generates a significant part of its revenues outside the United States  38  of 2018 net revenues   The company is expanding in developing emerging markets like Russia  Mexico  China  India  Brazil and Africa through tailored distribution models and by offering locally relevant innovation and value added products  In Mexico and India  PepsiCo has a massive expansion plan for the next five years  Continued growth in these markets should contribute meaningfully to top line growth in the third quarter Expectations for 2019The company plans to continue investing in capabilities to drive growth  Consequently  it reiterated its guidance for the year For 2019  the company estimates organic revenue growth of 4  compared with 3 7  growth recorded in 2018  For the longer term  it projects organic revenue growth of 4 6  However  unfavorable impacts of ongoing investments to strengthen business  a higher tax rate and the absence of asset sale and refranchising gains in 2018 are likely to weigh on PepsiCo s earnings for 2019  Further  adverse currency rates are likely to hurt the company s sales and earnings this year Nevertheless  we expect all aforementioned growth drivers to offset these minor hurdles and help the company continue its robust top  and bottom line beat trend in the third quarter Earnings WhispersHere is what our quantitative

136574,358089,EL,Why Estee Lauder  EL  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Estee Lauder  EL   This company  which is in the Zacks Cosmetics industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This beauty products company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19 99  
For the most recent quarter  Estee Lauder was expected to post earnings of  0 53 per share  but it reported  0 64 per share instead  representing a surprise of 20 75   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 30 per share  while it actually produced  1 55 per share  a surprise of 19 23  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Estee Lauder  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Estee Lauder has an Earnings ESP of  1 44  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-estee-lauder-el-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200469552,200469552

   Says sees gradual improvement in sales
   Luxury products op  margin 11 9 pct vs 19 6 pct in 2008
  
  Adds details 
 PARIS  Aug 27  Reuters    L Oreal on Thursday posted a
smaller than expected drop in first half profit  as consumers
tightened their belts and became more reluctant to spend money
on high end lipsticks and creams 
 The French beauty products giant repeated that it expected
revenue to gradually improve throughout the rest of the year 
The maker of Biotherm and Lancome creams made an operating
profit of 1 37 billion euros in the six months to June 30  down
8 3 percent against last year and compared with an average
forecast of 1 29 billion euros in a Reuters poll of nine
analysts 
 The group saw its operating margin slip to 15 7 percent from
17 3 percent by the end of June 2008 
 The operating margin of luxury products fell to 11 9 percent
from 19 6 percent  a drop L Oreal partly blamed on  contracting
markets and substantial inventory reductions by distributor
customers  
  L Oreal sees a gradual improvement in sales over the rest
of the year   Thierry Prevot  head of the group s financial
communications told reporters during a conference call 
 L Oreal will hold a news conference in Paris on Friday
morning at which investors are hoping to get more details on its
cost cutting efforts 
 In February  the Paris based group introduced its first
hiring freeze since 1974 and said it had cut 500 jobs in the
United States  At the time  it also said it would try to keep
margins stable this year 
 Earlier this month  U S  rivals Estee Lauder and Elizabeth
Arden forecast weaker than expected 2010 profits as they expect
women to keep their purse strings tight until they see tangible
signs of economic recovery

136658,358173,EL,Avon s  AVP  Open Up Strategy On Track  EMEA Segment Hurts  ,opinion,Avon Products  Inc    NYSE AVP   witnesses solid momentum in the bottom line backed by the execution of its  Open Up Avon  strategy  This strategy emphasizes on reviving the company s direct selling business model  renovating the brand  enhancing e commerce and other capabilities to aid a performance driven transformation  Also  its focus on e commerce expansion by improving digital tools is encouraging  Further  it also remains committed to accomplish the financial targets for 2021 However  we cannot ignore the soft trends in the EMEA segment due to challenges in Russia and a declining beauty market  This  along with other factors  has hurt the company s top line  Moreover  adverse foreign currency rates have been hurting top line performance over the past few quarters  The company s revenues lagged the estimates in nine of the last 12 quarters mainly due to adverse currency impacts and decline in Representatives  Second quarter 2019 also marked the company s third straight sales miss Factors Aiding GrowthAvon is on track with the  Open Up Avon  strategy  which is aiding its bottom line performance  As part of the plan  the company expects to improve operating efficiency  slash inventory levels and reduce portfolio complexity by certain restructuring efforts  including 25  decrease in Stock Keeping Units  SKUs   15  reduction in inventory levels and 10  job cuts  These job cuts are estimated to fetch Avon annualized pre tax savings of nearly  97 million by 2019 end  All these efforts are likely to help it simplify operations and generate higher cost savings With regard to Avon s financial targets for 2021  it intends to generate total cost savings of  400 million by expanding manufacturing and distribution  outsourcing efficiencies  zero based redesigning of back office functions  reducing certain facilities and managing revenue  interest and tax  In addition  management expects to invest roughly  300 million toward commercial  digital   IT infrastructure projects  Investments in the digital   IT infrastructure initiatives also include reinforcing the company s balance sheet  where its cash generating abilities must exceed the investment plans  Through this strategy  it expects to achieve revenue growth of low single digits and margin expansion of low double digits by 2021 Additionally  the company is capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the fast growing e commerce realm  hence making this platform a major growth driver  Further  it remains committed to improving digital tools and e commerce channel for bolstering Average Representatives sales The company s new Avon ON app  which is an end to end solution to aid the Representatives  is currently available in 18 markets  In fact  this app is a 100  mobile tool  incorporating all the services in one suitable place to simplify and expand Representatives  business  Further   My Avon store  is now accessible across 27 markets  while digital Avon brochure is now available in all markets  Backed by all these initiatives  the company has been steadily expanding the percentage of sales through the online channel  In fact  Avon targets doubling e commerce sales in 2019 Further  the company s growth efforts place it well for competition with peers like e l f  Beauty   NYSE ELF    Coty   NYSE COTY   and Estee Lauder   NYSE EL    in the cosmetics space Near Term HeadwindsAs already stated  Avon displayed a dismal sales trend in the last few quarters due to impacts of adverse currency and decline in Representatives across segments  Notably  second quarter 2019 marked the company s third straight sales miss  Although it remains focused on revenue growth management  visible growth in the top line is unlikely in the near term Moreover  the company s EMEA segment has been displaying soft trends due to significant challenges in Russia  a declining beauty market with increased competition and weaker sales leader engagement  Second quarter 2019 revenues in EMEA dropped 15  year over year and 8  in constant currency  This was mostly due to significant softening in Russia Notably  Russia s beauty market is highly competitive  particularly in direct selling  In the reported quarter  constant dollar revenues in Russia fell 12   Currently  the company is focused on reviving business in Russia through increased training  upgrading brochures  product innovations  deploying direct delivery to customers and expanding the digital business  However  we expect the operations in Russia to take some time to stabilize and return to growth Nevertheless  we expect all aforementioned growth drivers to offset minor hurdles and help Avon sustain the solid

136691,358206,EL,4 Consumer Staple Stocks Likely To Win Big On Q2 Earnings,opinion,Wall Street is reeling under severe volatility injected by heightened trade conflict between the United States and China  Meanwhile  the second quarter 2019 earnings session is gradually approaching its end  Interestingly  although the pace of earnings growth has declined  overall results are not as bad as initially expected  Notably  the consumer staple stocks have so far performed impressively Why Consumer Staple Stocks The consumer staple sector includes companies that provide necessities and products used in daily lives  which make them defensive in nature  So  this has always been the go to place for investors  who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations Consequently  adding stocks from the consumer staple basket usually lends more stability to portfolios in an uncertain market condition  Moreover  the sector remains a lucrative space for income seeking investors given its strong dividend yield Notably  year to date  the Consumer Staple Select Sector SPDR  XLP  has gained 14 6   almost in line with the broad market S P 500 Index s gain of 15   However  during

136694,358209,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Estee Lauder  EL  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This beauty products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 8  
Revenues are expected to be  3 51 billion  up 6 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 43  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Estee Lauder 
For Estee Lauder  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 46  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Estee Lauder will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Estee Lauder would post earnings of  1 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of  19 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Estee Lauder appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200454267,200454267

136752,358267,EL,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Estee Lauder  EL  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Estee Lauder  EL   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for EL that show why this beauty products company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For EL  shares are up 2 15  over the past week while the Zacks Cosmetics industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 84  compares favorably with the industry s 3 57  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Estee Lauder have increased 12 11  over the past quarter  and have gained 36 61  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 3 41  and 8 71   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to EL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  EL is currently averaging 983 141 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with EL 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EL s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 21 to  5 22 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that EL is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Estee Lauder on your short list ",2019-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-estee-lauder-el-is-a-great-choice-200446581,200446581

136778,358293,EL,Why Estee Lauder  EL  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Estee Lauder  EL   which belongs to the Zacks Cosmetics industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this beauty products company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 16 11   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Estee Lauder came out with earnings of  1 55 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 30 per share  representing a surprise of 19 23   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 54 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 74 per share  delivering a surprise of 12 99  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Estee Lauder  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Estee Lauder has an Earnings ESP of  8  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

136792,358307,EL,Bull Of The Day  The Estee Lauder Companies Inc   EL ,opinion,"Shares of Est e Lauder  EL  have crushed the market in 2019 and touched yet another new high on Tuesday  The high end makeup firm posted better than projected third quarter fiscal 2019 results in May and raised its full year outlook 
EL Overview 
Est e Lauder s business is made up completely of what it calls  prestige  skin care  makeup  fragrance  and hair care  Today  the historic beauty company s portfolio includes over 25 brands that are sold around the world  This list includes its namesake Est e Lauder  as well as Michael Kors  Tom Ford Beauty  Tommy Hilfiger  and many more 
The overall prestige beauty industry is in the midst of a boom that includes upstart brands that have been able to expand in a digital and social media focused retail age  led by the likes of Instagram and others  For instance  music star Rihanna s Fenty Beauty brand  which  goods giant LVMH  LVMUY   exploded onto the scene in just a few years to help her become the world s richest female musician  according to Forbes   Favorable demographic trends make prestige beauty a desirable  growing industry  and as the best diversified pure play  we are confident in our ability to lead and to gain global share   EL s CEO Fabrizio Freda said in prepared remarks last quarter 
Est e Lauder s chief executive has helped the company impress Wall Street in recent years  The firm has topped our quarterly Zacks earnings estimates for 19 straight periods  Meanwhile  the makeup giant s quarterly sales results have beaten expectations nine quarters in a row 
Last quarter  EL s strongest growth drivers were the Asia Pacific region  along with skin care  its namesake brand  La Mer and Tom Ford Beauty brands  as well as travel retail and global online channels  Plus  as we mentioned at the top  Est e Lauder raised its net sales and EPS guidance for the year 
Price Movement 
With all this in mind  it s easy to see why EL stock is up big over the last several years  Shares of Est e Lauder have climbed 41  since the start of the year  which blows away the S P 500 s 16  and the Soaps Cosmetics Market s 22  which includes Avon  AVP   e l f  Beauty  ELF   Revlon  REV   and others  EL closed Tuesday at  183 95 per share  after touching a brand new 52 week and all time high of  184 48 in intraday trading 
 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Moving on  current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s fourth quarter fiscal 2019 revenue to jump 6 5  to  3 51 billion  This would mark a slowdown from last quarter s 11  top line expansion  Meanwhile  Est e Lauder s full year revenue is projected to jump 8 1  to  14 79 billion  Peeking further ahead  EL s fiscal 2020 revenue is expected to climb nearly 7  above our current year estimate to  15 79 billion in a sign of stable and strong top line growth 
At the bottom end of the income statement  Est e Lauder s adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to slip 18  to  0 50 per share  Despite this expected downturn  EL s full year fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to jump 15 5  to  5 21 per share  On top of that  the company s fiscal 2020 EPS figure is projected to surge 10 6  higher than our 2019 estimate 
Along with its expected longer term earnings growth  Est e Lauder has topped earnings estimates in the trailing four periods by an average of 14   including a 19  beat last quarter  as part of the larger run of positive surprises  Plus  EL s fiscal 2019 and 2020 estimates have come up in a big way over the last 60 days 
 
 
Bottom Line 
A few of EL s key valuation metrics are currently a little stretched compared to where they have been over the last five years  which is to be somewhat expected as Est e Lauder stock continues to climb  Yet  Est e Lauder s longer term earnings estimate positivity helps the company earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment 
Some investors might be hesitant to think about buying EL at its new highs  so it might not hurt to wait for a possible pullback  But buying a stock at new highs shouldn t be dismissed out of hand  because if you owned the stock already one would be extremely happy to see it continue to hit new highs as it has for the last six months  Est e Lauder is also a dividend payer that has raised its payout in recent years  And the Cosmetics industry  which Est e Lauder is part of  rests in the top 11  of our 254 Zacks industries right now

Estee Lauder is cautious about certain factors like tariff impacts in China  costs related to Brexit  and slow moderation of net sales growth in China and travel retail network  Also  softness in the brick and mortar retail space in the United States and the United Kingdom  especially in makeup  is a concern  Nonetheless  the company intends to make further investments in the United States in the

136809,358324,EL,Here s Why Estee Lauder  EL  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Estee Lauder  EL   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if EL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this beauty products company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For EL  shares are up 0 01  over the past week while the Zacks Cosmetics industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 12  compares favorably with the industry s 0 41  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Estee Lauder have increased 11 03  over the past quarter  and have gained 13 1  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 2 32  and 5 42   respectively 
Investors should also take note of EL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  EL is averaging 1 258 822 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with EL 
Over the past two months  11 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EL s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 05 to  5 21 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that EL is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Estee Lauder on your short list ",2019-06-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-estee-lauder-el-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200432498,200432498
136810,358325,EL,HELE Or EL  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in Cosmetics stocks are likely familiar with Helen of Troy  HELE  and Estee Lauder  EL   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Helen of Troy and Estee Lauder are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
HELE currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 42  while EL has a forward P E of 35 09  We also note that HELE has a PEG ratio of 2 33  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  EL currently has a PEG ratio of 2 71 
Another notable valuation metric for HELE is its P B ratio of 3 53  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  EL has a P B of 14 34

In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end

Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Estee Lauder is 26 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 2 1  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 8 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Estee Lauder  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 1  over the past month

136925,358440,EL,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Estee Lauder  EL  Now,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Estee Lauder  EL  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this beauty products company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Estee Lauder is 11 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 9  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Estee Lauder is 26 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 2 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Estee Lauder have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Estee Lauder has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

This combination indicates that Estee Lauder is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-04-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-estee-lauder-el-now-200411596,200411596
136926,358441,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The Estee Lauder Companies  EL   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 9  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  172 76 in the previous session  The Estee Lauder Companies has gained 32 6  since the start of the year compared to the 15 6  move for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the 30 8  return for the Zacks Cosmetics industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 5  2019  Estee Lauder reported EPS of  1 74 versus consensus estimate of  1 54 
For the current fiscal year  Estee Lauder is expected to post earnings of  5 08 per share on  14 58 billion in revenues  This represents a 12 64  change in EPS on a 6 55  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 63 per share on  15 55 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 87  and 6 68   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Estee Lauder may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Estee Lauder has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 34X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 28 5X versus its peer group s average of 25 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 63  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Estee Lauder fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Estee Lauder shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Estee Lauder Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Estee Lauder have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including L Oreal SA  LRLCY   Inter Parfums  IPAR   and Unilever  LON ULVR   UL   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Estee Lauder  Still  the fundamentals for Estee Lauder are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200412323,200412323

136947,358462,EL,What Makes Estee Lauder  EL  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Estee Lauder  EL   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if EL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this beauty products company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For EL  shares are up 1 68  over the past week while the Zacks Cosmetics industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 21  compares favorably with the industry s 1 43  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Estee Lauder have increased 28 75  over the past quarter  and have gained 14 85  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 10 94  and 11 04   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to EL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  EL is currently averaging 1 010 102 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with EL 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EL s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 03 to  5 07 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line

136954,358469,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Estee Lauder  EL  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This beauty products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 57 billion  up 5 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 06  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Estee Lauder 
For Estee Lauder  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Estee Lauder will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Estee Lauder would post earnings of  1 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 74  delivering a surprise of  12 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Estee Lauder appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200410361,200410361

136979,358494,EL,Here s Why Archer Daniels   ADM  Q1 Earnings May Decline Y Y,opinion,Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   is slated to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 26  before market open Although the company came up with an average trailing four quarter earnings beat of 21 5   it witnessed a negative earnings surprise in the previous quarter  Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise    How Are Things Shaping Up Prior to 1Q19Archer Daniels  recent disclosures about adverse winter weather conditions in North America indicate that the company is set to witness soft first quarter results  Management notified that colder than normal winter weather has significantly hurt the company s North American operations  Heavy snow and rain storms in March  followed by floods and its after impacts are likely to weigh on the company s Carbohydrates Solutions and Origination segments  results Further  the extreme cold weather affected corn processing volumes on account of a slowdown in rail and truck transportation  which lowered shipments  In addition  the corn processing facility in Columbus  NE  remained idle due to flooding and presently functioning at reduced rates  Adverse river conditions since December have also been reducing barge transportation movements and port activities These afore mentioned weather disruptions are likely to hurt the company s pre tax operating profit to the tune of  50  60 million in the to be reported quarter  This impact will be almost equal at the Carbohydrate Solutions and Origination units  along with small impacts on the other segments As it is  Archer Daniels has been witnessing sluggishness across its Carbohydrate Solutions segment for a while now  which remain a concern for the to be reported quarter  Soft Bioproducts results  and lower ethanol margins and volumes are hurting the segment s performance  Also  lower margins and sales in EMEA as well as elevated costs in North American liquid sweeteners owing to lower production rates at Decatur complex remain deterrents Consequently  Archer Daniels  is expected to perform disappointingly in the first quarter   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings is pegged at 62 cents  indicating an 8 8  decline from the year ago quarter  Notably  estimates have witnessed downward revisions over the past 30 days  For quarterly revenues  the consensus mark stands at  13 7 billion  down more than 11  year over year On the fourth quarter 2018 conference call  the company stated that it expects the Carbohydrate Solutions segment s overall results to decline year over year in the first quarter  This projection can be attributed to persistent pressure on European sweetener and North American ethanol industry margins as well as issues related to the Decatur plant Nevertheless  Archer Daniels  focus on cost savings  management of business portfolio and Project Readiness appear encouraging  Also  the company is enhancing its nutrition portfolio  with citrus ingredients and flavors  Management remains focused on five major platforms   animal nutrition  health   wellness  carbohydrates  human nutrition and taste   to drive growth in the quarter to be reported Furthermore  at the Nutrition segment management expects increased profits in first quarter 2019  This will be backed by operational improvements and gains from acquisitions as well as higher margin and sales  Also  the segment s operating profit is projected to be significantly higher than the year ago quarter At Oilseeds  results will be impressive in the first quarter  excluding the biodiesel tax credit impacts in the prior year period  Crushing and origination s robust volumes  and gains from Algar  SoyVen and North American plant expansions are likely to boost the segment s results A Glance at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the first quarter  A stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  stocks are best avoided

137000,358515,EL,Bear Of The Day  Avon Products  AVP ,opinion,"Today s  Bull of the Day  detailed the successes of a clothing manufacturer and retailer that is not only surviving but thriving in the digital age  by selling products with huge consumer demand  strong brand cache and an innovative strategy 
The  Bear of the Day  today is headed in the opposite direction 
Founded in 1886 as the  California Perfume Company   Avon Products  NYSE AVP   has been selling fragrances and beauty products through independent representatives for over 130 years 
For decades  the  Avon Lady   as the company s independent representatives were commonly known  was a ubiquitous presence in American neighborhoods and homes  selling wares that were quite popular and not readily available through other channels 
Avon was also the beneficiary of some unintended good luck when it was discovered in the 1970 s that its  Skin So Soft  line of moisturizing cosmetics also functioned as excellent   and pleasant smelling   insect repellent 
During the golden years for Avon  its multi level marketing structure was very effective and many of the company s representatives earned a healthy living selling fairly unique and in demand products 
Times have changed however  and while Avon boasts more than 6 million independent sales representatives   second only to the undisputed MLM king  Amway   many of them sell only a miniscule amount of product to family and friends  who presumably would be buying similar products somewhere anyway  
As is common in Multi Level Marketing enterprises  Avon representatives commonly complain that the only way to make significant profit in the program is by recruiting new reps rather than actually selling product 
Claims that the company is a  pyramid scheme  are completely untrue   Avon sells actual physical products and its business practices are entirely legitimate   but the model does have obvious limitations as there is a finite number of people who are willing to become representatives 
Due to enormous competition in the health wellness and beauty products industries  revenues and earnings at Avon have been steadily declining for several years  Whereas once Avon held near monopoly power over the markets for cosmetics  customers now have countless options for similar products at every price point  from deeply discounted cosmetics sold at grocery and drug stores all the way to very high end options that boast about the quality of their raw materials  the ethics of their manufacturing and testing practices and most recently  even cannabidiol  CBD  extracts in their products 
Though earnings have been consistently disappointing and estimates have been declining   resulting in a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell    Avon shares are up over 85  so far in 2019  due mostly to rumors  that have been confirmed by Avon on its investor relations website  that the company is in talks to be acquired by Brazilian cosmetics giant Natura 
Investing in a company that is performing well on its own and therefore might be a takeover candidate is a fundamentally sound idea  Investing in a company who s only hope is a buyout is simply gambling 
With a current market price under  3 share and a potential deal on the horizon  it doesn t make much sense to be short Avon   there s too little to gain and too much to lose  
For a long position in the Cosmetics industry however  Estee Lauder   a Zacks rank  1  Strong Buy  or Revlon   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  are much sounder investments

137001,358516,EL,Is The Estee Lauder Companies  EL  Stock Outpacing Its Consumer Staples Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Consumer Staples space have likely heard of The Estee Lauder Companies  EL   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  Let s take a closer look at the stock s year to date performance to find out 
The Estee Lauder Companies is one of 166 individual stocks in the Consumer Staples sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  5 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups  measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  EL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EL s full year earnings has moved 4 36  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Based on the most recent data  EL has returned 26 27  so far this year  Meanwhile  stocks in the Consumer Staples group have gained about 10 93  on average  This means that The Estee Lauder Companies is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
To break things down more  EL belongs to the Cosmetics industry  a group that includes 13 individual companies and currently sits at  107 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 24 87  so far this year  so EL is performing better in this area 
Going forward  investors interested in Consumer Staples stocks should continue to pay close attention to EL as it looks to continue its solid performance ",2019-04-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-estee-lauder-companies-el-stock-outpacing-its-consumer-staples-peers-this-year-200403976,200403976
137011,358526,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The Estee Lauder Companies  EL   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  168 32 in the previous session  The Estee Lauder Companies has gained 29 2  since the start of the year compared to the 12 4  move for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the 27 1  return for the Zacks Cosmetics industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on February 5  2019  Estee Lauder reported EPS of  1 74 versus consensus estimate of  1 54 
For the current fiscal year  Estee Lauder is expected to post earnings of  5 06 per share on  14 57 billion in revenues  This represents a 12 2  change in EPS on a 6 47  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 62 per share on  15 55 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 11  and 6 72   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Estee Lauder may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Estee Lauder has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 33 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 27 7X versus its peer group s average of 22 2X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 57  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Estee Lauder meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Estee Lauder shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Estee Lauder Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Estee Lauder have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Reckitt Benckiser Group  RBGLY   Unilever  LON ULVR   UL   and Unilever  UN   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 40  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Estee Lauder  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-04-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200406295,200406295
137023,358538,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Estee Lauder  EL  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this beauty products company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Estee Lauder is 11 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 2  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Estee Lauder is 26 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 7  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Estee Lauder have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Estee Lauder a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Estee Lauder currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 49   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-estee-lauder-el-200403179,200403179

137105,358620,EL,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Estee Lauder  EL ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Estee Lauder  EL  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this beauty products company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Estee Lauder is 11 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 1  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Estee Lauder is 26 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 16 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 7  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Estee Lauder have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Estee Lauder a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Estee Lauder is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-03-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-shouldnt-overlook-estee-lauder-el-200395561,200395561

Middle East   Africa region improved 13   up 16  at cc  to  1 767 million  This was driven by growth in the Middle East  particularly Turkey   strong sales in Russia and solid travel retail sales

line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Nevertheless  revenues and earnings improved year over year  The quarterly results gained from strong performance in the cemetery category  Let s take a closer look   Q4 in DetailsAdjusted earnings increased 8  year over year to 54 cents per share  though it came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents  The year over year upside was backed by solid cemetery profit  gains from newly acquired businesses and favorable impacts from tax reform and planning  These upsides were partly offset by lower profit in the funeral segment Adjusted effective tax rate was 20 5  in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 28 2  in the same period last year  owing to reduced state taxes Total revenues of  820 8 million  inched up nearly 1  from  812 7 million in the year ago quarter  Improved cemetery revenues aided the top line  However  the figure came below the consensus mark of  846 8 million Service Corporation International Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     General and administrative costs increased nearly  7 1 million to reach  38 5 million  owing to higher legal settlement costs  general liability and worker compensation claims The company s interest costs rose  3 4 million to  47 million  due to higher interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and increased total debt Segment DiscussionComparable Funeral revenues declined 2 8  owing to lower core and recognized preened revenues  Core revenues declined as a result of lower funeral services performed and reduced average revenue per service conducted  Moreover  revenues in this category were dented by the absence of flu season  Recognized preneed revenues declined on fewer contracts sold  These downsides were partly compensated by higher non funeral home revenues  Comparable preneed funeral sales production declined 2 1   This was due to lower non funeral home sales  stemming from temporary disruption caused by restructuring of sales associates    Comparable funeral operating profit declined 7 8  to  90 6 million and the operating margin contracted nearly 100 basis points  bps  to 20 1   The downside resulted from lower revenues  higher wages and increased medical claims  These were partially offset by lower selling expenses Comparable Cemetery revenues rose 3 6  year over year  courtesy of higher recognized preneed revenues  partially offset by decline in other revenues  Comparable preneed cemetery sales production grew 11 8  on account of higher preneed property production Comparable cemetery operating profit rose nearly 2 8  to  118 4 million  while the respective margin contracted 30 bps to 33 8   Higher revenues in the unit were more than offset by increased fixed costs stemming from wages and medical claims Other

million Net cash from operating activities  excluding special items  amounted to  163 5 million in the quarter compared with  125 4 million in the prior year period  The improvement was triggered by lower cash taxes During the fourth quarter  Service Corporation returned  32 7 million to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks  while it returned  401 5 million during 2018 Also  the company incurred capital expenditures of  17 9 million and  226 9 million during the fourth quarter and 2018  respectively  These expenditures were mainly incurred for accretive acquisitions and building new

For the current fiscal year  Estee Lauder is expected to post earnings of  5 01 per share on  14 56 billion in revenues  This represents a 11 09  change in EPS on a 6 42  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  5 57 per share on  15 54 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 11 14  and 6 71   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Estee Lauder may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Estee Lauder has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 31 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 26 2X versus its peer group s average of 14 4X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 55  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Estee Lauder meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Estee Lauder shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-02-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200392160,200392160

137166,358681,EL,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Estee Lauder  EL ,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Estee Lauder  EL  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this beauty products company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Estee Lauder is 11 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 1  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Estee Lauder is 26 4   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 25 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 9 7  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Estee Lauder  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Estee Lauder a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Estee Lauder well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-02-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-estee-lauder-el-200386252,200386252

137191,358706,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Is Up 6 75  In One Week  What You Should Know,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Estee Lauder  EL   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if EL is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this beauty products company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For EL  shares are up 6 75  over the past week while the Zacks Cosmetics industry is up 3 02  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 14 53  compares favorably with the industry s 3 91  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Estee Lauder have increased 6 02  over the past quarter  and have gained 10 79  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 37  and 5 38   respectively 
Investors should also take note of EL s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  EL is averaging 2 872 364 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with EL 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EL s consensus estimate  increasing from  4 83 to  4 88 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that EL is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Estee Lauder on your short list ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-is-up-675-in-one-week-what-you-should-know-200384464,200384464

137221,358736,EL,Estee Lauder  EL  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Estee Lauder  EL  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This beauty products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  0 7  
Revenues are expected to be  3 92 billion  up 4 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 41  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Estee Lauder 
For Estee Lauder  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Estee Lauder will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Estee Lauder would post earnings of  1 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 41  delivering a surprise of  15 57  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line

That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Estee Lauder  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Estee Lauder has an Earnings ESP of  0 60  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 5  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

year to date  wider than the  s 3 3  decline  This underperformance can be attributed to Avon s dismal surprise trend mostly attributed to soft Representative growth  Notably  the company lagged the

delivered impressive top line performance  it witnessed sharp margin contractions in the quarter  Active and Ending Representatives fell 5  and 6   respectively  Adjusted gross margin contracted 410 basis points  bps  due to higher supply chain costs and a negative impact from the adoption of the new revenue standard Moreover  adjusted operating margin fell 280 bps due to higher investments in Representative  sales leader and field expenses largely due to the national transportation strike in Brazil in the previous quarter  Moreover  increased advertising and net brochure expenses  mainly in Brazil  on higher brochure volumes negatively impacted margins So let s analyze whether the company s growth initiatives can help reverse the stock s downtrend Growth StrategiesAvon is in the third

food products delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter  though it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2 8  in the trailing four quarters  Let s see what s in store for Pinnacle Foods this time around Pinnacle Foods Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Can Revenue Driving Initiatives Offset Hurdles Pinnacle Foods should continue gaining from its focus on acquisitions  innovations and robust brand portfolio  Well  the company has a solid customer reach  as its products can be found in over 85  U S  households  Pinnacle Foods has been undertaking constant innovations to maintain market share  Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent  Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits  Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles  The company also revealed plans to roll out new products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expand its Hungry Man Handful line in 2018  which may benefit the quarter to be reported  These factors  along with improved pricing and contributions from its Duncan Hines Grocery and Birds Eye Frozen businesses fueled its top line in the last reported quarter  wherein the company delivered a solid in market performance  Moreover  the quarter marked Pinnacle Foods  15th straight quarter of market share growth However  sales were somewhat by exit of certain low margin Aunt Jemima   AJ   products  shut down of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales  Weakness in underlying sales resulted from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume mix  Well  AJ exit and underlying sales decline was a major drag for the Specialty Foods segment in particular  as sales here tumbled almost 10  in the fourth quarter of 2017  Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume mix stemming from the company s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business  Markedly  analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Specialty Foods to fall 9 1  to  80 million in the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Birds Eye Frozen  or Frozen  and Duncan Hines Grocery  or Grocery  segments are pegged at  319 million and  260 million  respectively  in comparison with  321 million and  259 million  The consensus mark for sales at Boulder Brands  which is likely to be hurt by shut down of Boulder UK operations  stands at  103 million Though net sales in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to gain from early Easter  overall top line looks somewhat pressurized from the aforementioned hurdles  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at  763 million  reflecting a decline from  766 million reported in the year ago period Cost Savings Efforts vs  Input Cost InflationPinnacle Foods has been battling elevated costs owing to increased packaging and logistics costs  This  along with unfavorable impacts of product mix  increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from

Valuation Metrics
While EL has moved to its 52 week high in the recent past  investors need to be asking  what is next for the company  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style

Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Estee Lauder meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though EL shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2018-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauder-el-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200302352,200302352

137568,359083,EL,Pinnacle Foods  PF  Q3 Earnings Likely To Rise  Here s Why,opinion,Pinnacle Foods Inc    NYSE PF   is slated to report third quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter  Notably  the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3 1  Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement What to Expect Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable at 58 cents in the last 30 days  However  the estimate reflects a year over year growth of about 9  from the year ago quarter Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  751 million  down more than 1  from the prior year period Markedly  Pinnacle Foods is part of the  sector  As of Oct 20   the Consumer Staples sector s earnings as well as revenues are expected to grow 1 8  each Factors Likely to Influence the QuarterPinnacle Foods has been gaining from its solid brand portfolio and robust strategic initiatives  The company has been also innovating products to offer variety and maintain market share  Additionally  the company s expansion via acquisitions drives growth and remains impressive  The notable acquisitions include Boulder Brands and Duncan Hines Meanwhile  Pinnacle Foods  operational excellence program designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain  remains encouraging  Productivity for 2017 is estimated to be at the top or marginally above its cost of products sold range of 3 5 4   These productivity savings  along with higher pricing have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins Additionally  in order to enhance gross margin  Pinnacle Foods is pursuing other initiatives including improving its product mix through product innovation and low margin SKU rationalization  increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending  and realizing synergies from acquisitions These initiatives are reflected in the company s share price  which increased 4 8  year to date  as against the  s decline of 10 3  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues of the Frozen  Grocery and Specialty Foods segments are currently pegged at  315 million   259 million and  84 million  respectively  These estimates show a year over year increase of about 2   3 8  and 5 8  for each segment  correspondingly Also  volume for the Frozen and Grocery segments is likely to increase 0 04  and 0 01   respectively  in the quarter  However  volumes are expected to decline 0 04  for the Specialty Foods segment  We note that Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing sluggish net sales and adjusted EBIT for its Specialty segment since four consecutive quarters now  despite solid growth in the Snacks business  Evidently  sales at the segment declined 15 1  in the previous quarter Meanwhile  the company has witnessed sluggishness in its Pickle business due to continued competitive environment in the form of pricing and innovation  This  in turn has put pressure on the performance of Vlasic pickles  Though innovation and in store support for the brand is expected to strengthen trends for the business in the second half of 2017  the turnaround might take some time What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model shows that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with

137618,359133,EL,Shuffle Your Portfolio  Buy Or Avoid These Cosmetics Stocks,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been in investors  good graces of late  buoyed by an improving economy  strong labor market and continued hiring  improved GDP numbers as well as a resurgent housing market  These factors hint on rising consumer confidence in the months ahead and suggest that the economy is in good health 
Consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity  also plays a major role in the upward revision  It grew 3 3  in the second quarter  compared with the government s earlier estimate of 1 9  
Though Hurricanes Harvey and Irma storms along with North Korea s back to back nuclear tests on Japan have spurred global tensions and unnerved investors  we believe these short term headwinds can be overlooked as we can see signs of continuing strength in consumer confidence  which in turn will lead to higher consumer spending and fuel growth in the near term 
The increase in consumer spending has also triggered growth in the cosmetics industry  particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup  Apart from buying essential and non durable goods ranging from everyday grocery  food items  beverages  tobacco and other household essentials  consumers started spending on beauty and personal care products  on top of larger purchases such as apparel and footwear and personal accessories 
The rise of e commerce and social media has further aided the fastest growing beauty channels  In fact  per media sources  the U S  beauty sector is expected to reach  90 billion by 2020  and the majority of the growth will come from premium beauty products and services 
How Is the Cosmetics Industry Placed 
We note that the  is currently placed at top 31  out of the 265 Zacks Industries  The industry has also been outperforming the S P 500 market lately  In the last six months  the industry recorded around 10 1  growth  well above the S P 500 Index s growth of 5 4   However  it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of  7  out of 16   placing it at the top 44  of the Zacks Classified sectors 

That s why it may be a good idea to invest in cosmetics stocks at this juncture  as signs of surging consumer confidence and economic recovery is making the industry attractive  Despite of industry gaining momentum  there are still some stocks in the cosmetics market that have been delivering sluggish results and are expected to continue to remain weak in the near term 
Given this backdrop  investors may want to reshuffle their portfolio and include those cosmetics stocks which have been doing well for quite some time and have the potential to deliver returns in the coming months  Also  investors should consider avoiding those cosmetics stocks  which are not capable of delivering desired returns 
How to Pick Viable Stocks 
We have narrowed down our search to the following two stocks based on their Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   These stocks also have positive estimates revision and their share prices are trending higher than the industry as well as broader sector s average

2 Stocks to Avoid
The below mentioned stocks from the industry have been underperforming since past many quarters and have also witnessed decline in share price in comparison to the industry as well as the broader sector  We suggest avoiding these stocks  which also carry Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell   possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions

137659,359174,EL,Why Avon  AVP  Stock Is Falling Post Q2 Earnings  Find Out,opinion,The rough phase seems to be far from over for the beauty products retailer  Avon Products Inc    NYSE AVP   as it continues to struggle with dismal top line and bottom line performances  Notably  the company delivered dismal second quarter 2017 results  lagging top line and bottom line estimates for four consecutive quarters now The impact of this dismal trend and the recently reported soft second quarter 2017 results is clearly reflected in the company s stock price  Evidently  the Avon stock has lost nearly 17 6  since reporting second quarter results on Aug 3  Further  shares of this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company have declined 45  year to date  while the  has gained nearly 4 8  What s Behind the Decline Clearly  the stock is struggling due to strained earnings and revenues  as discussed above  In the recently reported second quarter 2017  Avon s adjusted loss from continuing operations of 3 cents per share  compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 5 cents  Further  constant dollar revenue dipped 4  Avon Products  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Results for the quarter were mainly impacted by strong comparisons with the prior year quarter  Additionally  results were hurt by decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across all segments  barring Ending Representatives growth in North Latin America While the company registered gross margin growth  operating margins were hampered by constant dollar revenue decline resulting in deleveraged fixed expenses  higher bad debt expense  particularly in Brazil  increased Representative  sales leader and field expenses  elevated transportation costs  mainly in Russia  and investments in advertising for product launches Driven by second quarter performance  the company now expects constant dollar revenue growth for 2017 to be at the low end of its previously provided guidance range of low single digits growth  This led to a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last seven days  Estimates for 2017 and 2018 have fallen by 6 cents and 5 cents  respectively  to 9 cents per share and 27 cents per share Is There Scope for Revival While Avon s surprise history  stock performance and estimates trend suggest a bumpy road ahead  we believe the company s three year Transformation Plan  which is in its second year  could be a silver lining in these dark clouds Crossing the half way mark of the plan period  the company has witnessed significant progress compared with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience  In 2016  the company surpassed cost saving targets  realizing cost savings of roughly  120 million and considerably improved balance sheet as it reduced debt by about  260 million and extended maturity profile  In 2017  the company targets cost savings of  230 million  including run rate savings from 2016  along with in year savings from current year initiatives With significant progress on enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility under the Transformation Plan  the company is now keen on the third component of the plan   investing in growth  To this end  it is focused on implementing strategies that will aid in strengthening Avon while driving profitable growth  After deliberate evaluation  the company is now focused on putting in key enablers in place  These enablers include delivering a competitive  seamless experience for Representatives  making sure the Representatives have the right product to sell  and ensuring it is expanding in the right geographies  With regard to investing in growth  management plans to invest nearly  350 million over the three year period  including  150 million toward media and social selling  and  200 million for service model evolution and information technology  This is mainly aimed at bolstering the overall Representative experience Bottom LineThe stringent focus and swift progress on the Transformation Plan could be rewarding for the company  However  the dismal revenues and earnings indicate that more efforts need to be put in  We would hence prefer to stay away from the stock until the success of its Transformation Plan starts to reflect in top line and bottom line results Stocks to ConsiderBetter

long term debt of  1 873 8 million  and shareholders  deficit of  853 1 million  excluding non controlling interests  Transformation Plan UpdateAvon is in the second year of its three year Transformation Plan that was announced in Jan 2016   The plan mainly focuses on investing in growth  enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility  Crossing the half way mark of the plan period  the company has witnessed significant progress against its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience In 2016  the company surpassed cost saving targets  realizing cost savings of roughly  120 million and considerably improved balance sheet as it reduced debt by about  260 million and extended maturity profile In 2017  the company targets cost savings of  230 million  including run rate savings from 2016  along with in year savings from current year initiatives  The company stated that savings realized through first half indicate that it is on track with its goals for 2017  These savings have considerably aided in countering inflation With significant progress on two factors  the company is now keen on investing in growth by implementing strategies that will aid in strengthening Avon while driving profitable growth  After deliberate evaluation  the company is now focused on putting in key enablers in place  These enablers include delivering a competitive  seamless experience for Representatives  making sure the Representatives have the right product to sell  and ensuring it is expanding in the right geographies With regard to investing in growth  management plans to invest nearly  350 million over the three year period  including  150 million toward media and social selling  and  200 million for service model evolution and information technology  This is mainly aimed at bolstering the overall Representative experience OutlookOn the back of second quarter performance  the company now expects constant dollar revenue growth for 2017 to be at the low end of its previously provided guidance range of low single digits growth  This expectation continues to be based on its previously stated Active Representatives growth of 0 1  in second half 2017  along with solid innovation pipeline and the effects of the ongoing Transformation Plan  Additionally  the company had earlier projected modest currency tailwinds to aid top line growth Further  the company expects the aforementioned top line growth and its ongoing cost savings initiatives to result in operating margin expansion  Moreover  the company now

    The company s business is accelerating of late  driven by many brands  channels and markets that experienced strong momentum  Since the beginning of fiscal 2017  sales have improved  The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced  during the first quarter fiscal 2017  strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed approximately half the reported sales growth in third quarter fiscal 2017  The company expects sales growth to increase further in the fourth quarter  with continued improvement expected in fiscal year 2018 
Further  consumers  rising demand for beauty products  particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup  has resulted in robust growth in its high end brands and continued double digit growth in the makeup category  In addition  the company is witnessing strong growth in the fastest growing beauty channels  with travel retail  online and specialty multi  each rising strong double digits  The company is expected to remain focused on a dynamic prestige industry that has been growing steadily for many years and continues to grow faster than many other household and personal care sectors

However  the company is sceptic of slower retail growth in Hong Kong  decline in spending by travelers in France and Middle East  and unfavorable currency  Further  the company has been facing lower sales in America due to decline in retail traffic in U S  brick and mortar stores  principally for MAC  Estee Lauder and Clinique  A decrease in tourist spending also adversely affected sales in certain U S  MAC stores  The company is also facing difficult economic or political climates  particularly in the Middle East  Turkey and Latin America 
Though Estee Lauder is strategically focusing on expanding in Asia and foresees great improvement in China and Korea  there are still political tensions that have curtailed Chinese consumers traveling to South Korea

Per the latest Zacks  report  almost 71 1  of the companies surpassed earnings estimates  while 52 9  outpaced top line expectations in the second quarter  The second quarter of 2016 was the fifth quarter in a row to display a declining trend in earnings 
Nevertheless  we note a sequential improvement in earnings  Interestingly  this quarter is witnessing positive revenue growth and is currently reversing the trend displayed in the preceding quarter 
The second quarter earnings season is critical for investors to ascertain the most attractive picks as the market has somewhat stabilized after Brexit  which shook the global economy in Jun 2016  Post Brexit  investors became jittery and have been resorting to safe haven stocks 
In this scenario  the consumer sector might be quite reliable  So far  the consumer sector has reported modest results this quarter  In addition  lower gas prices  improved job scenario and increasing consumer confidence have been supporting the improvement in results 
As of Aug 10  2016  80 6  companies from the consumer staples sector enlisted in the S P 500 index have reported second quarter earnings  Out of these  72  of the companies have posted an earnings beat  while 52  surpassed revenue estimates

Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in its recent uptrend while Crude Oil turns lower in the consolidation zone in its downtrend  The US Dollar Index looks better to the downside in its broad consolidation while US Treasuries are biased lower short term in the uptrend  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue the slow move higher in the downtrend and Emerging Markets look to consolidate their move up in their downtrend 
Volatility looks to remain elevated but biased to the downside starting to ease the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  N SPY   iShares Russell 2000  N IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  O QQQ   Their charts all show short term digestion of the large moves higher and possible exhaustion short term  which could resume the downward path  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

137815,359330,EL,What s In Store For Herbalife  HLF  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Herbalife Ltd   NYSE HLF   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 5 after the market closes  Last quarter  it posted a positive earnings surprise of 29 35  
In fact  this weight management and nutritional products company posted positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters  generating an average positive earnings surprise of 21 93  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
 
Factors to Consider this Quarter
For the first quarter of 2016  Herbalife expects sales to decline in the range of 3  6  and volumes to be in a range of down 1 5  to up 1 5   On a currency adjusted basis  excluding the impact of Venezuela price increases tied to foreign exchange rate movements   sales are expected to increase 2 5    5 5  
For the first quarter  the company expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of 97 cents to  1 07 per share  which includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 27 cents per share  Excluding currency impact  excluding the impact of Venezuela price increases tied to foreign exchange rate movements   adjusted earnings are expected in a range of  1 24 to  1 34 per share 
We note that the company is witnessing volume improvement in key markets including the U S   Mexico and Brazil  as a result of strategic decisions taken to improve the business and tremendous leadership by all the senior sales leaders  The company anticipates that these important and effective changes will in turn improve volume growth in the to be reported quarter 
However  the company continues to face volume declines  particularly in the Americas region  which is weighing on its sales  Unfavorable currency is also a major headwind for the company and will continue to hurt earnings in the to be reported quarter 
Also  the company has been the target of activist investor William Bill Ackman  hedge fund manager of Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management since Dec 2012  Ackman believes that the company was running a pyramid scheme business model  in which profits are largely derived from recruiting new distributors and not from selling products  Such models are illegal because they eventually collapse once there are no more people to recruit  He also launched his  1 billion short position in Herbalife shares in 2012 
Since then Ackman has been trying every means to prove that Herbalife runs a pyramid scheme model  However  Ackman s back to back allegations prompted a civil investigative demand in 2014 from the FTC related to the company s marketing practices  Herbalife is reportedly in talks with the U S  Federal Trade Commission   FTC   about resolving a probe into whether the company is a pyramid scheme 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Herbalife is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Herbalife is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  1 07 per share 
Zacks Rank  Herbalife has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Although this increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s 0 00 ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are 
Church   Dwight Co  Inc    NYSE CHD   with an Earnings ESP of  1 19  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Estee Lauder Companies  Inc    NYSE EL   with an Earnings ESP of  1 67  and a Zacks Rank  2

Echoing the strength in the auto manufacturing sector  American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Inc   NYSE AXL  announced double digit growth in its sales and bottom line 
As a leader in driveline and drivetrain systems for light trucks  sport utility vehicles  SUVs   and cars  the company s first quarter sales grew 14  to  859 million  with non General Motors Company GM  sales leaping 53  over the first quarter of 2013 to  289 million 
Citing much improved sales for the  Jeep Cherokee  and  Dodge Ram  full sized trucks  management expects a strong year  The company s content per vehicle grew 10  to  1 655 and earnings improved 360  to  33 6 million 
And good numbers aren t just related to the auto sector  Estee Lauder Companies Inc  EL  just hit an all time record high on the stock market after beating the Street on revenues and earnings  the company also increased its earnings per share  EPS  forecast for the year 
Announcing results for its third fiscal quarter  ended March 31  2014   the company s sales improved 11  over the same quarter last year to  2 55 billion 
The company said it experienced solid growth in all its operating regions  as well as margin expansion  which resulted in a 19  comparative gain in quarterly earnings to  213 million 
The numbers beat management s own expectations for the quarter  and the company produced double digit growth in all five of its main operating categories with the exception of hair care products 
In local currency  all of the company s operating regions  being the Americas  Europe  the Middle East and Africa  and Asia Pacific  produced double digit net sales growth 
And in the heavy equipment business  H E Equipment Services  Inc   NASDAQ HEES  saw its revenues climb 12  to  237 million in the first quarter 
Serving the U S  market selling and renting construction equipment  cranes  lift trucks  and earthmoving equipment  the company s bottom line leapt 56  to  7 4 million  with rental revenues growing 14  and new equipment sales jumping 30   comparatively 
Company management sees a positive year in 2014  and they said that the recovery in domestic construction markets is gaining momentum 
Generally  my economic outlook and stock market view are shaped more by what corporations actually report about their businesses and their forecasts for the future 
Now  not all of first quarter reporting was good  but for the most part  my read on the numbers is that business conditions are improving  And while the first quarter was soft for a lot of businesses due to the weather  corporate outlooks are holding firm  I expect corporations to boost their own earnings forecasts in the bottom half of the year 
From pharmaceuticals to software  railroads to toothpaste  it s been a pretty good quarter  and this market is not overvalued 
Stocks are due for a break  and I expect share price action to be soft for the next several months  But with plenty of double digit gains in corporate revenues and earnings  the outlook is improving  It should be another good year  with share price strength weighted to the fourth quarter
